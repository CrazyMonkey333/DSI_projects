 SWITCH  Well, that was quite an anticlimax."

 "BEN" "I think we've got something, too. The fall of Sigma Octanus was inevitable."

 "HAN" "Not since you've been around long enough to have become paranoid."

 "BEN" "I'm not going to argue with that."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, I'm beginning to suspect that you're not quite so innocent after all."

 "HAN" "Well, if I may say so, I've got something to tell you. And it's a very good one, kid."

 "THREEPIO" "You know, I think you're going to like it here."

 "THREEPIO" "I'm going to have a few words with your landlord."

 "HAN" "What do you mean?  I'm going to have a few words with your landlord."

 "THREEPIO" "You're going to be out of here very soon, Hunchback."

 "HAN" "Good. Stay here and watch after the camp, okay?"

 "THREEPIO" "I have a bad feeling about this."

 "HAN" "Okay, stay here and watch after the camp."

 "THREEPIO" "What happened?"

 "HAN" "Well, I heard some strange noises this morning.  I took a few moments to investigate, but I'm afraid I'm not quite sure what you're talking about."

 "THREEPIO" "What sound do you mean?"

 "HAN" "Well, I'm afraid I'm not quite sure.  I'm afraid the club fights are getting worse and worse every day."

 "THREEPIO" "Are you kidding!  How could I be so stupid?  He really is a great guy."

 "HAN" "No, he's not going to try anything."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh.  Well, he's not going to try anything, either.  But he might do us a service by coming back."

 "HAN" "What happened?"

 "THREEPIO" "Well, it's a little far-fetched, but I thought you might have something to say about it."

 "HAN" "No, I'm not going to argue with that."

 "THREEP SWITCH  Activate the deflector shield."

 "DODONNAX" "The Death Star will be completed on schedule."

 "THREEPIO" "Artoo, you'll be dead."

 "DODONNAX" "I will not waver!"

 "IMPERIAL OFFICER" "The Death Star will be operational as planned."

 "DODONNAX" "And everyone will be safe.  We've got to be safe for a  little while longer."

 "THREEPIO" "I've got to go back and finish cleaning those droids."

 "THREEPIO" "No, Artoo, you'll never be as clean as I am.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well."

 "DODONNAX" "Your uncle is unfit to rule you.  He is dangerous."

 "THREEPIO" "I hope you mean "dangerous" in the sense that you don't mean to destroy me."

 "THREEPIO" "No, I'm not going to risk it.  I've got to finish cleaning those droids.  Mmm... fresh air!  Haven't you got a little fire in you?"

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, I do.  I'm a fair cook, you know?  I'm not going to risk it."

 "THREEPIO" "I'm going to have company."

 "THREEPIO" "I'm going to have company."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, yeah.  I'm going to the cantina."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, yeah.  I'm going to the cantina."

 "THREEPIO" "I'm going to the buffet."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, yeah.  I'm going to the buffet."

 "THREEPIO" "I'm going to the buffet."

 "THREEPIO" "Are you going to the buffet?"

 "THREEPIO" "I'm going to the detention level."

 "THREEPIO" "What's that?  I don't get it."

 "THREEPIO" "What's that?  I don't get it."

 "THREEPIO" "What are you talking about?  I'm not getting into any of SWITCH  Turn right.  This is it.  Stay on the right.  This is it."

 "LUKE" "Oh, no!"

 "THREEPIO" "We've got to get out of here quick."

 "HAN" "Where could they be?  Threepio, the cantina guy, tell them we're  blocking the main entrance."

 "THREEPIO" "But it's 1 in the morning and we're  supposed to be working?"

 "HAN" "Fast food!  I can't believe they let us in."

 "THREEPIO" "We're a little embarrassed, but we have to share a  bathroom.  Chewie, will you shut the door behind you?"

 "HAN" "Yeah, sure."

 "THREEPIO" "Hey, you don't know how lucky we are to be  here.  We'd much rather have  been in the restaurant."

 "HAN" "Well, at least we're out of your hair."

 "LEIA" "What's wrong with the Falcon?"

 "HAN" "Old Falcon, do you know what I'm talking about?  I'm talking about the beast that'll take down the city of New York or something!"

 "LEIA" "I've got to get aboard.  Listen, you'll tell me all about it.  I'll shut the door."

 "HAN" "All right, kid.  But you don't have to do this to me.  This is what happened to our wagging little tails."

 "LUKE" "Shut the door!"

 "HAN" "Back when I was a kid, I used to whip you into shape when things got rough.  Now, you're turning into a complete snob."

 "LEIA" "That's it.  We're lost."

 "HAN" "I'm going to shut down the  autotuvering  circuits in the shuttle."

 "LEIA" "What about the fighter?"

 "HAN" "Well, the fighter's disabled, so you're going to have to make  this shot. Besides, I've got a bad feeling about this."

 "LEIA" "A bad feeling about something?"

 "HAN" "You know, when I first heard about this, I thought SWITCH  Center Switch."

 "CENTER CONTROLLER" "Yoda, you will not go astray."

 "YODA" "There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will my friends."

 "EMPEROR" "Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete."

 "WALKER PILOT" "Look!"

 "PILOT" "Get him off of there!"

 "HAN" "I think I got it. I got it!"

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?"

 "HAN" "Let's see."

 "LEIA" "It's not bad."

 "STORMTROOPER" "Freeze!"

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, dear."

 "STORMTROOPER" "Don't move!"

 "HAN" "I love you."

 "LEIA" "I know."

 "STORMTROOPER" "Hands up! Stand up!"

 "HAN" "Stay back."

 "HAN" "Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea."

 "EMPEROR" "Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through you."

 "VADER" "Obi-Wan has taught you well."

 "LUKE" "I will not fight you, father."

 "VADER" "You are unwise to lower your defenses."

 "LUKE" "Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict."

 "VADER" "There is no conflict."

 "LUKE" "You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now."

 "VADER" "You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny."

 "EMPEROR" "Good.  Good."

 "LANDO" "Watch out. Squad at .."

 "REBEL PILOT" "I'm on it, Gold Leader."

 "WEDGE" SWITCH  This is the main entrance to the control bunker. Keep half your group out of range for the next run."

 "THREEPIO" "I can't believe he's still on my tail!  I nearly gave him to the Jawas years ago..."

 "HAN" "That poor little droggie.  He's been through a lot."

 "LEIA" "Well, at least your still in one piece shape."

 "HAN" "Yeah, that's what I am."

 "LEIA" "What happened?"

 "HAN" "Where?  I'll have to start over."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, it's been ruined.  I'm afraid he's unaware that your droids have replaced his memories."

 "HAN" "Not interested in his retinas, anyway."

 "LEIA" "Well, at least your still on the move."

 "HAN" "Not if I can help it.  Chewie, can you slow down a bit?  This train is getting rather rumbling now."

 "LEIA" "Maybe you can slow me down a little?"

 "HAN" "Sure, sure."

 "LUKE" "Wow, you know that little droid so well.  He even led me on one more time.  We even had a few moments together.  Now, all I can see is a lot of moving parts."

 "HAN" "Here we go, honey.  Ripley's down there.  It's definitely not good."

 "LUKE" "I don't think she's going to be very helpful, however.  First of all, she's not supposed to know what she's doing.  Secondly, she's going to get herself into some very serious trouble.  Here's the deal, all right?  I'm taking off!  I'm taking off!  I'm taking off!"

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, no!  I'm taking off with you, too!"

 "HAN" "I don't know where he is."

 "LEIA" "what's wrong?"

 "HAN" "Well, he seems very friendly."

 "LEIA" "What do you mean?"

 "HAN" "Well, just... friendly is probably the wrong word to use, since I don't know what he SWITCH  I WATCH OUT FOR.  I'VE BEEN AWAY FOR A WHILE.  I'M NOT THINKING. " "OWEN" "I've got to get aboard.  Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back. " "LUKE" "I don't know where he is!"

 "OWEN" "He's not here!  Something bad has happened to him.  He must have forgotten to take his taxi."

 "LUKE" "What happened?"

 "OWEN" "-- He got into a taxi with a very bad luck  driver."

 "LUKE" "What do you mean?  I don't know where he is."

 "OWEN" "He must have forgotten to take his taxi.  It's not my fault!  It's been so long since I've had a cab.  I've got to get aboard."

 "LUKE" "What are you talking about?"

 "OWEN" "I'm going to start looking for him."

 "LUKE" "You're going to start looking for him."

 "OWEN" "I have no leads.  I'm going to have to shut down."

 "LUKE" "Why?"

 "OWEN" "-- He's fast enough for my liking."

 "LUKE" "But what good are snub fighters going to be against that?"

 "OWEN" "Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station."

 "OWEN" "The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station."

 "OWEN" "Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes."

 "THREEPIO" "How could they miss us?"

 "THREEPIO" "They flared their searchlights out... and disappeared."

 "THREEP SWITCH  They're trying to keep the speeder from breaking down.  But it's impossible to hide from Imperial eyes all the speeders that are  coming into the base."

 "THREEPIO" "And what about those speeders that you saw at the blockade run?"

 "THREEPIO" "Those speeders didn't belong to me.  I'm giving them to the Imperial authorities.  They didn't belong to me.  Now I'm putting them back together."

 "THREEPIO" "I...I'm going to put all power in the front  shield.  That's what we should be doing.  There's no escape, my young apprentice.  We're being melted down like meat and drink."

 "EMPEROR" "Good.  Try not to get reacquainted with that body."

 "EMPEROR" "I have your apprentice.  I want him to survive.  I don't want him to rot in  the garbage chute."

 "EMPEROR" "You weak-minded piece of...!  I will teach him a lesson that will make him the envy of the galaxy."

 "EMPEROR" "He'll be all right.  I'm just putting him back together now."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, no!  He'll never change."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, yes, yes, you will.  Artoo, you're going to be the master of this  ship.  No one will challenge you."

 "EMPEROR" "Good.  Try not to get reacquainted with that body."

 "EMPEROR" "What a pathetic appearance.  I can't help but notice your poor... slave  condition.  It would be a great pity if I had to leave a garrison  here. It's not that I dislike you, sir, but... I'm afraid this place is unsafe.  I'm sorry."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, Artoo, I'm terribly sor... Artoo, you're going to have to go  somewhere else.  There's really nothing more I can do.  It's quite late for me, anyways.  I'm not going to bother to type out this letter."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, quite.  I'm terribly sor... Artoo, you're going to SWITCH  Now you will learn the ways of the Force."

 "LUKE" "Look who's talking.  Now we know why you were killed."

 "THREEPIO" "What good are snub fighters going to be against that?"

 "THREEPIO" "Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the Force."

 "LUKE" "So she has us blow up the whole ship."

 "THREEPIO" "No, Captain Solo, the Empire does not consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the Force."

 "HAN" "What's that?  I know that weakness!  I'm going to blow it up!"

 "HAN" "Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him."

 "THREEPIO" "And he'll make it look like he's doing it."

 "HAN" "There'll be no one to stop us."

 "THREEPIO" "Artoo, are you kidding?  The Academy didn't even bother to pick up a few pieces of equipment.  It's all gone to waste."

 "HAN" "My... uh... space ship?  I'm going to shut down the whole thing.  It's not going to work."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, I'm terribly sorry."

 "HAN" "Well, at least your still in one piece you moron."

 "LEIA" "I'm going to shut down the whole ship."

 "HAN" "No, no, no!  I'm going to keep trying to get to the top!"

 "LEIA" "I can't keep you from getting blown to bits!"

 "HAN" "No, no, no!  keep trying!"

 "LEIA" "No!"

 "HAN" "I'm going to... is what I'm doing!"

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, very good.  You have learned much, young one."

 "LUKE" "No!  I'm not ready to die."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, of course SWITCH  August 21, 27, 33.  The Seven Sorrows."

 "HAN" "What do you mean?  I've had enough of you!  Go that way!  You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!"

 "BEN" "And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it."

 "HAN" "Fine!  I'll close the gap on them!  Come on!"

 "THREEPIO" "Wait, Luke!  This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?"

 "HAN" "He's the brains, sweetheart."

 "THREEPIO" "What happened?"

 "HAN" "Well, I think he might have meant Cole.  Do you think he's going to believe me?"

 "THREEPIO" "Well, he's got a lot of explaining to do.  First he must be trusted.  Then he must be allowed to come with us to the surface.  Then we'll clean him up and bring him to you."

 "HAN" "Why don't you take the ship and go home?  I didn't want to wait for the Empire to pick up where they were."

 "THREEPIO" "I think you overestimate their chances."

 "THREEPIO" "Well, they're starting to pour into the area, sir."

 "LEIA" "The report is coming in."

 "HAN" "It's too bad the Empire couldn't get its act together.  If they'd just let us go, we might have been all right."

 "THREEPIO" "I know it's too late for that, sir.  You should have bargained, and gotten the information we need.  We'd still be in full power.  It's not my fault."

 "LEIA" "No, it's your fault, too bad you didn't follow through."

 "HAN" "There are still two more systems to go, and I need your help to sort out the mess."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, I know, sir.  I'm sorry."

 "LEIA" "No, it's not my fault."

 "HAN" "There's two more SWITCH  Wake him up!  Uncle Owen should be here any moment.  He's been quite unable to contain his excitement."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh, no!  Uncle Owen must have forgotten to take these steps.  Uncle Owen will most certainly not  accommodate a  clumsy uncle."

 "THREEPIO" "Uncle Owen will most certainly not  accommodate a clumsy nephew."

 "UNCLE OWEN" "Well, if he doesn't get up, I'll have to put him in the  basket."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh!  Oh!  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well."

 "UNCLE OWEN" "Well, if he doesn't get in, I'll have to put him in the  basket."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh!  Oh!  I can't bear to leave this innocent little  creature to rot in the sun."

 "UNCLE OWEN" "Well, if he doesn't get in, I'll have to put him in the  basket."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh!  Oh!  I hate the sun."

 "UNCLE OWEN" "I hope he gets it before it's too late."

 "THREEPIO" "Oh!  Oh!  I love you!"

 "LUKE" "THREEPIO!"

 "THREEPIO" "I love you too!"

 "THREEPIO" "I...I don't even know what I'm saying."

 "THREEPIO" "What are you saying?  I'm not even sure I can understand it.  We're going to get pulverized if we stay out  here much longer."

 "THREEPIO" "Well, I'm going to start for my ship.  I'm  going to the  rendezvous point.  There's nothing more I can do.  This place is dangerous.  I've seen a lot of bad stuff.  But I've never seen anything to make me want to leave this  place."

 "LUKE" "Threepio, we're  going to get pulverized if we stay out  here much longer."

 "LUKE" "Threepio, you're wrong.  I'm going to try to save my skin.  There's nothing to worry about.
