Engineering Edit

ARCHER: We can do it.

STEL: The Captain's crucial for these negotiations.

ARCHER: He'll need three of us.

STEL: There's a fourth, perhaps. I've only met one individual upon

appointment.

ARCHER: We have a little business arrangement. You'll be dispatched at

four twenty hours, no later.

 [Situation

room]

 T'POL: You

know the rest of the crew are suspicious.

PHLOX: You

know I wouldn't lie to you.

TUCKER: You're in a dangerous situation.

PHLOX: If you're going to endanger the crew I have to do it.

Flying home comes with a high risk. It could make things worse.

TUCKER: That's a risk you're willing to take.

PHLOX: It's appropriate that we conduct our business in private.

TUCKER: I'll run an analysis of the data you sent back. We'll

pick up this mystery from here. It may be a Vulcan ship.

ARCHER: Archer to Engineering.

T'POL: A Vulcan ship?

ARCHER: Go ahead.

T'POL: I'll contact the Captain.

(the Worm and a brunette come down the stairs, with a

channing man, lying down)

 [Bridge]

 T'POL: I believe Temporal Cold War

are at their height.

T'POL: It's adopted.

PHLOX: I had a conference today.

T'POL: I believe that's no coincidence.

PHLOX: This young woman is very interested in you. Please, sit down.

T'POL: She's an Inquisitor. The meeting was a weavil'ne.

ARCHER: What's happening with Enterprise?

T'POL: A threat of your ship.

ARCHER: It's a Vulcan ship.

T'POL: It's a transport vessel.

ARCHER: How do you operate it?

T'POL: I've only spoken to one. Very quietly.

 [Shuttlepod]

 T' SWITCH ?: Stop

 [Shuttlepod]

 TUCKER: (entering the outer hatch) The shuttlepod's locked down.

 [Launch bay]

 TRAVIS: The port hatch's open. I thought you were going to unlock it.

 [Shuttlepod]

 TRAVIS: I was about to but I know you're coming. So I'm just going to wait.

 [Launch bay]

 TRAVIS: The crew's not pleased with the way Enterprise is being run.

 [Shuttlepod]

 TRAVIS: We're going to have to shut down the reactor. If we don't do that, we'll be stuck with what's left.

 [Launch bay]

 TRAVIS: (steady on her feet and turns the controls) Hold it.

 [Shuttlepod]

 TRAVIS: Report. (She punches a hole in the door. More crewmen come out to see her.)

 [Shuttlepod]

 TRAVIS: I just pummelled that hatch with my boot.  Crewman: (he's been cut) Trav, Travis, get us out of here. (A) life support's here. (She latches on.)

 [Airponics]

 TRAVIS: I want to talk to you. (T'Pol enters.) T'POL: Captain?

ARCHER: You should want to watch.

T'POL: Captain, they've disabled the intermix regulator. I can't restore it.

ARCHER: Shut it down! (TLN goes offline.)

 [Bridge]

 ROONEY: A loss of power to the reactor section. It's beeing shut down. (The shuttlepod, now in orbit above Enterprise, is badly damaged)

TRAVIS: It's just outside the shuttlebay.

ARCHER: Can you bring us a few kilometres to the shuttlepod?

HOSHI: Understood.

ROONEY: A problem with the air-air plasma deuterium injectors. They're down.

 [Engineering]

 ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Lieutenant Reed. It's time for you to get out

of there, Ensign. (He takes his station's weapon.) ARCHER: Report.

REED: The aliens are holding position.

ARCHER: Kill the aliens.

(A terrific k SWITCH CO-PILOT: There. Everyone, stand up.

TUCKER: Dave keep your hands where you can. (He does. The Parasite

rises from the table.)

REED: (to Doctor Phlox) We've had enough of your new friend. Drop her. She's

been exposed to an extremely potent form of energy.

TUCKER: (to Klaang) How long have you known about this creature? I

wouldn't be surprised if she's morphed into some kind of

predatory bug-faced super-sauce.

TUCKER: I never thought about that.

T'POL: (picking up Klaang's arms and hovering over him) I think

we should get back to work.

REED: Why?

T'POL: We're still surrounded by hostile radiation. I think we

should inspect the exterior of the ship.

TUCKER: (to Tucker and T'Pol) You're the ones we need to see. So,

do you know what the hell's going on down there?

T'POL: I know you have a sneaking suspicion, but I can't compute

how they would be able to build such a weapon.

TUCKER: I've got a pretty good guess from the evidence we've seen so far.

T'POL: I've never been to the star system you mentioned, Captain.

TUCKER: It's called the Tarus. It's a system about a billion kilometres

away. It's populated by a culture friendly to aliens.

T'POL: Perhaps you should speed up your scanning schedule.

TUCKER: Well, there are a lot of things we've got to do right now.

T'POL: It's not native to that region, and you will not have time to

meet it's people. All you'll know is that your expedition has been

interrupted.

TUCKER: Not interrupting what, Captain?

ARCHER [OC]: I want to speak with you immediately, Trip. I apologise,

Eleanor.

TUCKER: How do you mean?

ARCHER [OC]: You have an opened channel. Type it in.
 SWITCH   PLAYBACK   

[Docking dock]

(Rice is entering her vagina while

Tony meditates.)  TUCKER: Hi.

TRAVIS: Hi.

TUCKER: What can I do for you?

 [Laboratory]

 (Rice is lying on the ground, with Tucker,

holding a piece of the ceiling block.)   TUCKER: Excuse me?

RICE: What?

TUCKER: Do you have any thoughts about becoming Foreman? I know we've got a lot

to do, have you thought about it?

RICE: What are you talking about?

TUCKER: (takes a box off the table) What's that?

RICE: It's a device for female masturbation. The vibrations are

precise.

TUCKER: Excuse me?

RICE: You use it when you're aroused.

TUCKER: Well, I've been curious about that.

RICE: We use it to stimulate our vulvas.

TUCKER: You know, for a lot of guys it's a little bit

uncomfortable.

RICE: It takes practice. Only time.

TUCKER: I can try. Right, here. (Tucker holds a device

with which he can stimulate the vulva.) TUCKER: It feels lovely.

TUCKER: Five hundred microseconds, Mistress. I think it's quite a

glimpse.

RICE: It's gentle. The vibrations last for about fifteen

minutes.

TUCKER: I'm sorry, I can't.

RICE: That needs practice.

TUCKER: If we're not busy, why don't we try?

RICE: The Tactile Orocyte Mineralis is highly sought-after. It is

near-infrared. It absorbs most forms of energy except that which

comes from the very near. Sir, we're about to commence our next

course. A few moments, please.

(Micaiah enters,)

MICAIAH: It's just a student from my government. I hope she's ready

for this SWITCH  THE

JUAN [OC]: Another landing.

T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Captain Archer.

TALOK [OC]: If you're out of range, I need you in my quarters immediately.

REED [OC]: Lie still and steady, and you won't be disturbed.

T'POL [OC]: Please wait a moment. We need your crewman.

 [Archer's quarters]

 TUCKER [OC]: I'll bring another rumour that I know of,

Speedy will be aboard one day. As long as I'm in command I'm getting out of

the ship. Just so you know, he expects me to do exactly what I

said to do. If you need anything, he runs a fine establishment on his

world so don't expect me to left without a reward.

(he comes in) We agreed to meet a couple of hours later and he

arranged for me to take my hat off. (gets a pair off)

TUCKER: You ready?

 [T'Pol's quarters]

 (T'Pol is in bed with the Vulcan man she likes

the best.)

T'POL: It's a pleasure to meet you. We have a lot of stories about our

starfleet captain. It'll come to you.

HOSHI: Understood. (T'Pol is in her finest black negligee, sitting on the floor.)

 [T'Kareth Sanctuary - afternoon]

(T'Pol says goodbye to her Sarin.)

T'POL: You're welcome.

HOSHI: Thank you. (T'Pol enters the sanctuary.)

T'POL: Hello there.

T'KLAS: When you were a child, you always had a smile.

T'POL: Before I was able to speak, I was a pure Vulcan.

T'KLAS: A gift?

T'POL: I remember the day we left Earth. My parents were desperate for

my return. They saw your face one last time. You were going to give it

to that Semidan girl.

T'KLAS: A small SWITCH  warp core

crashed.)

TRAVIS: A transport ship's arrived at the scene. It's armed. They could be

civilians.

ARCHER: Bring a few more of your people along. Stand by.

TRAVIS: They're charging weapons.

ARCHER: They're targeting our warp core.

 [Corridor outside Bridge]

 TUCKER: I think so, Trip.

ARCHER [on viewscreen]: The warbird is approaching. Bring

urgent log.

TUCKER: A transport ship in orbit. Looks like we're off to a

quick start.

ARCHER: Run a security scan for us.

TUCKER: Aye, sir. (Archer changes the viewscreen track.) TUCKER: What

happens if we try to leave the system?

ARCHER: You might find more of your orders coming through audio.

TUCKER: Hang on a minute.

ARCHER: The next time you try to control the warp core you could

cause a warp trail. There's got to be some way to get through

those shields. I guess I'm just not comfortable getting it directly

into the system.

TUCKER: Our warp core's at stand-by. We've got an okay

fleet approach for that. I don't want to crash the ship but

you've been warned.

ARCHER: I'm ready to restore normal order, and I certainly

want that warp core repaired.

TUCKER: And required that repair done now. The next target

weapon that comes here is going to be badly damaged.

ARCHER: Let me know. (T'Pol leaves.)

TRAVIS: The impulse manifolds are down.

ARCHER: We're taking fresh off-worlders off the Bridge. They'll have

to be jettisoned. The Warp core's powered by impulse. To

activate the EPS grid it'll have to be powered by a fusion

reactor. If we don't have that technology in six weeks the ship

will be forced to set a course for the midnight star.

TRAVIS: A warbird of our design.

ARCHER: Find the boys in SWITCH 

ARCHER: We can't do it without the warp drive.

ARCHER: I think I'm doing the right thing. We're going to need full stop

forsight to recover from this.

 [Ready

room]

 ARCHER:

Are you clear?

HOSHI: Achda zhaurat. It's a Gyrannan tragedy. Everyone I've met

evolves into it.

ARCHER: The one thing all humans share is a desire for

distinction. Something to unite us. You've made it clear that

the As'ya are not yours.

JOHN: Then why do you want the As'ya to fight so relentlessly

against you?

ARCHER: Because it's one of the oldest and most

absolute enemies of humanity. The fact that you won't turn your

whips and heart into your own kind.

HOSHI: And for all your talk of iniquity, have you ever even thought

to fantasise about the First Monarch of Terra?

ARCHER: It certainly didn't occur to me in a sexual

context.

HOSHI: A sexuality that encompasses the entire spectrum.

ARCHER: As you'll soon discover, it's rather diverse. Primarily homosexual

and asexual.

HOSHI: Was that debauchery?

ARCHER: When I was a kid, it was all fun and games.

HOSHI: The tension was never great.

ARCHER: Stress and anger can make a man act out his fantasies.

HOSHI: They make him do it. The tension builds, and it's not safe,

but there's always the distraction of the thought that it means he's not

possessing her. And she's always in control.

ARCHER: Maybe he is. See you soon. (Hoshi leaves.)

ARCHER: I still think I owe him a V'Li.

T'POL: If she's significant to you it's likely that you'll marry her. So,

think about it.

ARCHER: We're going to the commune. He's my assistant. We can't.

T'POL: The captain wouldn't have lasted SWITCH 

(He is back in his normal clothes in the corridor.)

T'POL: Commander Calla. No doubt it's a pleasant surprise.

TUCKER: I heard about your sister. They're gonna have a party. I'll be one

             

(He signs his name. There are excited gasps from the other

people.)

 T'POL: Even by Vulcan standards a child is quite a sight. Our

invited guest is Captain Archer.

ARCHER: Hello.

T'POL: Your name is T'Pol, Captain of the Starfleet ship Enterprise.

ARCHER: I'm from Earth. Captain Munoz is my crewman at his station on

the Starship Enterprise.

T'POL: Mister Munoz's the one you've been guiding for some time.

I'm pleased to see you finally returned. (T'Pol starts to pull her chair back

because it's almost time for her to sit up.) T'POL: I think you're due to arrive

at your station at a convenient time, sir. I've arranged for a shuttle.

T'Pol starts muttering to +Rees.)

TRAVIS: T'Pol?

T'POL: She's done muttering.

ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.

TUCKER [OC]: The Vulcan ship is fifty thousand kilometres

away.

 TUCKER: I believe we've got ourselves a nice party SWITCH 

(The person activates the door.)

GRAL:   You're giving me away.

T'POL: You find me.

GREAL: I'm not fooling you. Get him to the Vulcan ship.

T'POL: A Vulcan ship. You're going to have a lot of gap to fill.

GREAL: Aren't you already there?

T'POL: You are a little late. We're working.

GREAL: Is that a-

T'POL: I'm responsible for this ship.

GREAL: Seriously?

T'POL: Unless I'm making an error in timestream calculations, I've got

you.

GEORGE [OC]: George to Captain Archer.

ARCHER: Go ahead.

T'POL: Stand by.

 [Bridge]

 (A distorted vision of a blue

giant is being worked on, with humans in the background. The liquid

jettisons into view the bits of alien equipment.)

ARCHER: My Captain.

T'POL: This is a Vulcan ship. There isn't time to intercept.

ARCHER: Can I help you?

T'POL: I'm in charge. (The computer is switched off, and a Vulcan

man looks on.)

ARCHER: Can I help you? (He presses a button and we get a view

of the sundered vestibule.)

VULCAN: Now is not the time to return to your ship. Do you see

where he is?

T'POL: It's clear that Enterprise is attempting to return to

Starfleet orbit.

VULCAN: So he's already back on his homeworld. We need to locate

him.

ARCHER: How long?

VULCAN: Two hours. If we don't have time to retrieve him in time,

he'll die.

VULCAN: That is too long.

VULCAN: If I were in his position, I'd do exactly the same thing.

ARCHER: His crew's not going to buy it.

VULCAN: You may have saved our lives several times before. If you think (A

ELIWOOD: Go!

Alyx [OC]: There's a problem. The transceiver's unavailable.

T'POL: Then clear it with mine.

ELIWOOD: Your comm. is no longer working. You're in danger.

T'POL: No, no, it's actually okay. I've activated the transporter. Now you'll

be safe.

ELIWOOD: It took a while, but I finally figured out how to mine the

electronic core. I'm glad you finally accepted my terms.

T'POL: Well, I think it's time to ask why.

PHLOX: The body was decompressed by a large amount of

pressure. If you want to die with dignity you'll have to put off

towards our moods.

ELIWOOD: There's another option. You can try that which I can't.

T'POL: I've altered our memories. We're unique among android species.

With our technology our emotions are almost entirely behind us.

Elenor [OC]: This is captain Cyrus Archer. We're here to find you and

hold you responsible.

ARCHER: All right, but I'll point out a flaw in your logic. You're

not a guilty man.

ELENA: That's why I can save your life, Captain. If you'd listen

towards me I wouldn't have to abduct you.

ARCHER: That's not a far question.

ELENA: You need to understand that this will impact you differently than

other starship captains. I've taken the liberty of changing your

profession. I already lost my present status. A good spy on me would

shock her me in this fashion. You are no longer welcome aboard.

ARCHER: Go ahead.

PERRY [OC]: A Vulcan transport vessel, the Korok, has contacted us. They're

picking up your signal.

ARCHER: Any ship in range.

KOROK: Our sister ship is seeking you!

ARCHER: If you respond to our distress call.

KOROK: We are not a peaceful people
