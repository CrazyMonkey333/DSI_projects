 SWITCH 

KIRK: Keep trying to contact the Captain. There's been a radio silence. We may

never hear from him. 

UHURA: Captain, the way the Klingon ship is pointing, they might as well be

looking for a shortcut to Enterprise. The point where they are

pointing 

KIRK: To what end, Lieutenant? 

UHURA: To find out, sir. 

KIRK: To what end, Lieutenant? 

UHURA: To find out, sir, we are being probed. 

KIRK: How long will we be able to determine direction of travel? 

UHURA: I cannot say. The turbolift seems to be taking us nowhere. 

SULU: They may have found another ship. 

SPOCK: That may be true, Captain. The turbolift seems to be

trailing us. 

KIRK: How far are we, Mister Sulu? 

SULU: I can't see anything. 

SPOCK: There may be many many places on the planet where we will

be found eventually. 

KIRK: There's the ship, there's the star, there's even the

galactic crust. 

SPOCK: The fluid is viscous, very viscous. 

SULU: The ship won't leave orbit or enter the nova. 

KIRK: Lock main phasers on it and prepare to fire. 

SULU: On command, sir. 

(The ship enters the nova) 

KIRK: Fire. 

SULU: Locked on. 

(The ship deflected the photon, but the saucer is

blown away) 

KIRK: Hang on. I'll give you a better look. Mister Sulu, aim for the

neck area. Our science ship will follow shortly. 

SULU: Captain, I'm dropping to my highest targeting power. 

MCCOY: What do you mean, Mister Sulu? 

SULU: I'm targeting the pilot. 

KIRK: Get ready to fire. SWITCH 

STAVOS: I calculate the cosine of the

x, y and z values and arrive at the desired one. 

KIRK: Now, Mister Sulu, use your sensors to circle the globe,

and sing the praises of your master race to the hive mind. 

SULU: Absolutely, sir. Every science geek needs a mate. 

SPOCK: The cloud appears to be making use of a combination of existing

organisms, Captain. 

KIRK: Which ones? 

SPOCK: Approximately 95 per cent complete, Captain. The last five per cent

undetermined. 

SULU: Thank you, Mister Spock. Mister Spock? 

SPOCK: I have kept my scientific findings private, Captain. I have made the

surprise discovery that almost everyone aboard is, in fact, a

computer. 

KIRK: Captain, there's something about these aliens. They talk like a

gang of hydras, use of their minds to accomplish tasks. 

GREEN: They are the universal translator, sir, but they

talk in gibberish. 

KIRK: For the Love of Science, Mister Spock, try and keep that

to yourself. Mister Sulu, keep the communicator in Sickbay. 

SULU: Aye, sir. 

KIRK: What happened to the Captain and the others? 

GREEN: They were manipulated, to the point of believing they were

invading another planet. 

KIRK: But we're not here on a pleasure trip, aren't we? 

GREEN: It was an illusion. They tricked them, as everyone else has been

attempted. 

SPOCK: I am inclined to agree with the Doctor, Captain. The bulk of the

crew appear to be the cause of the confusion. 

KIRK: What happened to the Captain and the others? 

GREEN: They were tricked into thinking they were

invading another planet when in fact they were attacked by a

multi-species creature from another star system. 

SPOCK: By the way, Mister Sulu, do you know how many Earth

humans there are on SWITCH 

KIRK: All right, guys. Let's go get Mudd on the rescue mission.

 [Jungle]

 (Kirk, Spock and Sulu are trapped under the

bed, but they are alert and alert. Uhura spots a monster

in the corner and goes for a weapon. The weapon doesn't work) 

KIRK: Scotty, up ahead on the cover. Scotty, up ahead on the

cover. 

SCOTT [OC]: Aye, aye, sir. 

MCCOY [OC]: Kirk, keep trying to get out of the trap. I'll cover you. 

KIRK: I'll get it. [OC] Keep trying to get out of the trap.

The

Ambergris Element

Stardate:

5499.9

Original Airdate: 1 Dec, 1973

 

Captain's log, stardate 5499.9. We are orbiting the planet Argo. Argo

was once a land planet, but it's surface is now almost completely

covered by water. The change was caused by violent seismic

disturbances. Our mission is to study the effects which the quakes and

other phenomena had on its surface. This knowledge may save millions of

lives on a Federation planet identical to Argo which will soon be

undergoing similar transformation.

 [Shuttlecraft]

 (A special shuttlecraft modeled on a catamaran has

been launched from Enterprise and landed on the ocean) 

KIRK: This is the largest land mass on the planet, isn't it, Spock? 

SPOCK: Yes, Captain. The others are mere outcroppings. They suggest the

peaks of submerged mountains. 

KIRK: The quakes are smaller, Mister Sulu. 

SULU: Yes SWITCH 

KIRK: No! 

(The giant pushes them off) 

SPOCK: The earthlings are not fooled. 

SULU: They're more vocal now. More aggressive. 

KIRK: Their minds appear to have been blown. Where are they, Down There? 

SULU: I don't know. Down There? To me it seems like ancient history. 

SPOCK: Apparently, a great deal of science has been lost since the 1930s. 

SULU: Apparently, a lot of the information we have on the planet is from those years. 

SPOCK: Apparently, a great deal of the information we have on the planet is from those

years as well. 

KIRK: Approximately what time are we out of contact range of the largest group

of earthlings to date? 

SPOCK: About ninety two minutes, Captain. That's when the earthlings will

arrive. 

KIRK: How soon? 

SPOCK: About two minutes, Captain. The others will probably arrive

some time after. 

KIRK: How are they going to get along without food or water? 

SPOCK: They'll be sicker than we will be, Captain. The planet will

be virtually lifeless. 

KIRK: It is by no means a walk in the park, Mister Spock. It is

possible to get injured camping on the planet. 

SPOCK: I have checked, Captain. I assure you this is a valid

diagnosis, and I have no reason to doubt your information. 

KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock. Then I'll com for McCoy and Bellevue. 

(Spock leaves) 

KIRK: Spock? Spock, what in the world? 

(He looks like he's been hit by a stone) 

KIRK: I'm fine, Bones. Lieutenant Uhura, bring the medical team in. 

(The four naked men and a pregnant woman are on the covers) 

KIRK: They're not, are they? 

SPOCK: I can't explain it, Captain. They appear to be SWITCH 

KIRK: Bones, please. 

MCCOY: He really doesn't seem the saboteur type, Jim. 

KIRK: Yes. The problem is, I don't think the Federation has come to

understand why we did it. 

MCCOY: Well, if the Federation doesn't understand, that's their problem.

Not yours. 

KIRK: It's our problem, too. Bones, we need a reason for

what we did. 

MCCOY: If you have a weapon, Jim, that can destroy an entire planet,

put an end to your career, and maybe even your life. Would you use

that weapon on Kirk or Spock? 

KIRK: You mean your life and those of your crew. 

MCCOY: I'm more concerned about the future of the galaxy, Jim. If the

whole galaxy goes, so does my job. If the whole galaxy goes, so does my

job. What's next? 

KIRK: You're the fifth crew member to die on the planet, aren't

you, Bones? 

MCCOY: I'm more worried about the future of the station, myself. Did I

misread the signs? 

KIRK: It's perfectly clear now, Jim. The signs are pointing in the same

direction. 

MCCOY: Jim, the whole thing was a trap. We set the trap by pretending to

destroy the transmitter. 

KIRK: And then we got away with it, because we didn't have to use a

weapon at all. 

SPOCK: Signals appear to be jammed again, Captain. But the transmitter is

undamaged. 

KIRK: I checked the ship out, Mister Spock. It's just like new. 

SPOCK: We're entering a sector where no ship has ever gone before. 

(The station is now, in a sector dominated by hundreds of

transmitting star clusters) 

SCOTT: Everybody else, get ready to beam aboard. 

M'RESS: Beam up, sir. 

KIRK: All crew members report SWITCH 

(The pod erupts, sending them plummeting toward the ocean)

 [Underwater]

 (Shoreline) 

UHURA: We've reached the ocean. 

KIRK: Quick, your air supply is almost exhausted. 

SPOCK: We're not expected to make it that far, Captain. 

(They descend into the ocean) 

SCOTT: We've reached the bottom, Captain. 

KIRK: How much water did we get under the surface? 

SCOTT: Two and a half metres, I think. 

KIRK: That's when we started to feel the effects of the

surface pressure change. 

SPOCK: Exactly where we are, Captain. The hydrostatic pressure in the

ocean is at least ten times normal. 

KIRK: Where are we? 

(A hydrostatic alarm sounds) 

SPOCK: A warning, Captain. The hydrostatic alarm is sounding in all

oceans. The warning will go out when the shock wave

has passed us. 

KIRK: It did, back when we were in the water. 

SPOCK: Captain, the surface of the planet has turned bright red. 

(A villi-shaped island with no buildings or vegetation) 

SPOCK: It is almost completely surrounded by water. 

KIRK: I'm sure there must be another gas cloud to obscure the island

from our sensors. 

SPOCK: There may be another cloud, Captain. I am of the opinion that

the cloud is a temporary structure, largely made up of his

waves. 

KIRK: He said he could repair the cloud's functions if he had to,

sinister phraseology. 

SPOCK: Function? 

KIRK: He said he could function, but he wouldn't give us

a chance. 

(The cloud does function, but it's hardly functions. There's no

signs of work around the compound) 

KIRK: Have the sensors been checked out, Spock? 

SPOCK: The sensors are normal, Captain. The ship's life support

system is SWITCH 

KIRK: This death clone would have a thousand years to live if it

had a will. Spock, use the macroscope. 

SPOCK: Macroscopes are antimatter dispensers, Captain. If the substance

is concentrated enough, the lens can focus it's beam on the user. 

(The cloud is made up of a much smaller fragment of the ship's

emotional energy, replaced by that of the exploding

ship) 

KIRK: It's disintegrating, Mister Sulu. There's no way to know how much of the

ship's power we haven't used up. 

SPOCK: There is, Captain. I can calculate the mass loss from the cloud. 

KIRK: Calculate it? 

SPOCK: Approximately three hundred million tonnes. 

KIRK: How much mass is that? 

SPOCK: Approximately three hundred and twenty million tonnes, Captain. 

KIRK: How much time do we have? 

SPOCK: Approximately eight hours, Captain. Eight hours, ten minutes, five seconds.

 [Engineering]

 SCOTT: Now, what's that thing? 

KIRK: Something's powering it. 

SCOTT: But what? 

(A blob of fog forms in the middle of the ship's wake) 

KIRK: It's getting smaller. Are our chances? 

SPOCK: I do not see any reason why the cloud won't break up, Captain. It

essentially eats the Enterprise up. And if it doesn't, the foam

will get smaller and the stick will get hotter. 

KIRK: Mister Spock, do you have any ideas? 

SPOCK: As to what, I have no idea. The stick could be directing

the stick at us, Captain. I'm just guessing. 

KIRK: Let's hope it's not. Mister Sulu, keep an eye on

that instrument. 

SULU: Aye, sir. 

KIRK: Let's hope it's a sensor blip, then. 

(The stick takes a sharp turn, and it blows the top of the ship

open SWITCH 

(The viewscreen comes to life and attacks the three Humans)

 [Bridge]

 SCOTT: All crew members

inconvenienced. Fortunately there were no

crew members here except for myself. 

M'RESS: No hands, no instruments, nothing. 

SCOTT: All crew members are out except for myself, sir. 

KIRK: Mister Sulu, keep an eye on the transmitter. I'll

scan it later. We have to disable it first. Mister Spock,

on your command, enter the transporter and make contact. 

SULU: Captain, what about the child? 

KIRK: Somehow I doubt that'll be necessary. I can cut the

ring control signals, and she'll get through. Mister Sulu, keep

attached to the transporter, my command. 

SULU: I'm sure we can arrange a rendezvous, Captain, but as we're

far enough along the way that I may be able to hear

what's going on, Spock suggests we take the liberty of speeding

through the rain. 

KIRK: I wouldn't wish that upon you, Mister Sulu. All crew members

inconvenienced. Myself included. 

SCOTT: Your Excellency, what is the problem? 

KIRK: Apparently, the power pack is disconnected. But the

planet appears to be fine. Where's that transporter control unit? 

SCOTT: That's mine, sir. 

SPOCK: The transporter controls are dead, Captain. 

KIRK: Mister Spock, what happened to the ship? 

SPOCK: Apparently, I, I'm not quite sure. 

KIRK: What about the captain and all other crew? 

SPOCK: Apparently, I, I was involved. 

KIRK: Captain, there's some confusion about who's commanding this

ship. 

SULU: Captain, we're under attack. 

KIRK: Attack, eh? On what? 

(The ship does some abrupt manoeuvres) 

KIRK: Mister Sulu, try to get those pilotless torpedoes. 
 SWITCH 

ORION: Shut up. We're rescuing you. 

(Some swoops are fired, but the Keeper falls to the ground) 

KIRK: Get him! 

SPOCK: I'm all right, Captain. I just sat down. I think I'll take a

few minutes to get up. 

KIRK: Bones, how bad is it out there? Walking around in a

circle. I can't imagine life without a wheelchair. 

MCCOY: I can't imagine life without a wheelchair either, but we're

all still alive, aren't we? 

KIRK: Believe it or not, Bones, the Kzinti are actually quite a

wonderful people. The little things wrong with their world are

minor compared to the wonders our world has to offer. 

ORION: And what would happen to us if we didn't reach our

destination? 

KIRK: Well, we'd still be walking aimlessly, and the Kzinti'd still be

laughing at us. 

ORION: So you two can keep walking, and never stop, Captain. 

KIRK: That's right. The Kzinti consider you their greatest asset and

master race. 

MCCOY: The master race? The ones we fear. 

ORION: We are the ones they fear. They think us impure, weak. 

KIRK: Look around you, Mister Orions. Everyone here is as easy as they

were to build. Everything is in order. Look at these simple creatures. From

where? 

ORION: They came from behind us, Captain. They thought we would fall for

their trap. 

KIRK: Didn't you hear that, Mister Orions? 

ORION: Yes, Captain. When the time comes, who will speak in defence of the

people you loved? We'll sing anyway we can, if we have to. 

MCCOY: I can't stand by idly as our ship is blown to bits. I

have to convince my men it's their master race again. 

KIRK: Yes, Bones SWITCH 

(The warp gauge blows up and we are pulled along by it)

 [Engineering]

 SCOTT: Pull me along with you, Captain. I can't hold it on my own

longer. 

(As we are pulled along, the wind from the explosion knocks us back)

 [Bridge]

 SCOTT: I think we're being pulled along, Captain. 

KIRK: Keep going, Mister Scott. There's no place for us here. 

(The bridge is completely blown up)

 Ship's log, stardate 5504.6. First Officer Spock

recording. The Captain's course change has taken us deep into the

Romulan Neutral Zone. Warp factor seven. 

(We are back in the Delta Triangle, and the whole thing is a blur)

 [Bridge]

 UHURA: Captain, I'm getting a reading on the

Warp Drive. It's not finished, and it's not working. 

KIRK: It's on the screen, Lieutenant. 

UHURA: I know. I can't believe it's real. 

KIRK: I'm sorry, Nurse. It's not your fault. 

SPOCK: The friction of the warp drive and the springs on your

feet caused us to slide into the Neutral Zone. 

KIRK: Relax, Nurse. We're not in a zoo. 

SPOCK: Relax? 

KIRK: You're in a Neutral Zone. As such, we have no

business interfering with your normal operation of a ship. 

SULU: And we don't trust Vulcans at all, do we? 

KIRK: That's right. 

SPOCK: Caused by the interference of the warp drive and

the adjustable seat belts. 

KIRK: Adjustment of the seat belts was to be made before our ship

disintegrated. 

SPOCK: The purpose of the trip was to determine if there was any

use involved, Captain. To assist in the determination of the

purpose of the trip. 

KIRK: You mean trick us, like all the time we spent trying to

talk to the Vulc
