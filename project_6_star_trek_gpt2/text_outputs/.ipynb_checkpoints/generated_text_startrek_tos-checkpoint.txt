(There's a big bang.) 

(Kirk watches on the monitor, but there are black dots on the screen. His eyes are trying

to adjust to the new situation.) 

KIRK: Same room. 

HODIN: Captain, I cannot respond. The mists still exist on the planet, but the

protection gives off by the sun is no longer enough.

The sun has to be obeyed. 

KIRK: Try cutting this frequency, Mister Spock. 

SPOCK: Aye, sir. 

HODIN: Seven nine. 

(There's a short flare in the foreground and then nothing.) 

HODIN: They're back here. They'll be back in a minute. Captain. 

KIRK: Ready, Mister Spock. 

(The turbolift complete, Kirk gets a bad head kick from Turner.)

[Bridge]

ANAN: Enemy, this is Captain Kirk. We're having trouble.

I've had difficulty getting through to him.

[Outpost]

(The red and yellow coloured letters 'A' and 'N' are

on a board. Givers are giving out orange pills.) 

KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, what's happening down there? 

UHURA [OC]: Resolution conference call. Report on the mists. 

KIRK: The mists? 

UHURA [OC]: Found us, sir. A cutting down on cables. All crewmembers off the

Bridge. 

KIRK: Are you sure of your report, Mister Turner? 

TRANSON: Yes, I have, sir. All right. 

KIRK: Through these. All right. 

TRANSON: Travel through it. Through this, Captain. 

KIRK: Mister Sulu. We're getting a distress call. 

SULU: Yes, sir. 

KIRK: Scotty, anything on your watch-out.

[Outpost]

(Outside, a lie-in is happening in an outpost.) 

SPOCK: Captain, I have located a communicator on this transmission line.
 SWITCH 

KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. Doctor McCoy has a very special

affection for you. If there is something we can do to help you, let me know.

[Pike's quarters]

MARTA: You must inform me where my food is. 

KIRK: The economic research station's on the bridge. I have to get off

the bridge. 

MARTA: It is not necessary. Mister Spock will be so delighted. Please,

don't tell me where your food is. 

KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to

Enterprise, Captain.

[Bridge]

(There are long, raised eyebrows as he walks through

the main corridor.) 

KIRK: Have you forgot to state your communicator's location? 

MARTA: I'll let Mister Spock and the crew find it. 

KIRK: I'll forget to say where your food is. Well, where are you?

[Kirk's quarters]

MARTA: I've been looking for you, Captain. 

KIRK: I just wanted to talk to you.

[Pike's quarters]

(McCoy gives him a shot of liquid nitrogen.) 

MARTA: No! 

KIRK: Well, have a look at him. He's alive, not merely suspended in the

void. You'd be the last to know what that suffered under. Our

Omicron Ship had probably no time for life-form analyses. 

MARTA: I am not a dancer. I have no need of any such words. Mister

Spock will be right back with you. So, this is one of our men. He's got

a training tape on a memory banks unit. Now, he's got to find out

if those memory banks are correct. 

KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. How is the memory banks

working? 

MARTA: They're a goddess' gift to the young officers. It's a rush job,

but we do have to get the ship out of orbit. 

KIRK: Yes, but he's got to be on board by now SWITCH 

KIRK: All right, Mister Spock, scan the level.

[Sickbay]

KIRK [OC]: Stand by. All personnel, remember.

Mister Spock, we've been dealing with a major battle

and you have it in your head to show your compassion.

[Corridor]

(A little later, Kirk is already showing compassion.) 

MCCOY: You know those little physiological ticks on your skin? The thing we

had to try was to break through to the brain and get those little things

in there. But I had a theory, Jim. 

KIRK: I'd love to try it. 

(He reaches for his own phaser, and gets knocked out.)



MCCOY [OC]: Where's the doctor?

[Sickbay]

SCOTT: The Captain was very disturbed by

your behaviour. I can assure you all and all that he

would be deeply interested in learning what a Vulcan mind can

sometimes do in a person through overwhelming force.

[Bridge]

SCOTT: What's wrong, Scott?

[Sickbay]

SCOTT: Well, just get rid of those binders. Pass them

through to the psychiatrist.

[Bridge]

SCOTT [OC]: Am I doing it?

[Sickbay]

SCOTT: Of course.

[Bridge]

SCOTT [OC]: Here we are. 

KIRK [OC]: Yes, no problem. Now do this.

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: Now. Kirk is wearing the doctor's loose

shirt.) 

MCCOY: In your own words, that's the Doctor McCoy we are looking for.

[Bridge]

SCOTT: No, that's not it. None of us are looking for

that.

[Sickbay]

KIRK: Medical reader. His name was Gilman T. Gilman T.

Gilman T. Gilman, Mister Spock, Ambassador Sarek. Mister Sarek, I have a

different patient for you. Our position on the phaser's impulse

power setting is not the same SWITCH 

KIRK: Don't worry, the tree is safe. I've got a method. (leaves) 

KIRK: If we do this, we can find the problem. Let's go.

[M4 Borgia]

SPOCK: Have you tried any of

these remedies? 

KIRK: No. No answer, sir. 

SPOCK: Then what about the alien? 

KIRK: The alien is dead. It's gone. 

SPOCK: Wouldn't it be much better if we could transport down to stop

them? If Jim sees this crevice again, he'd better warn you to stay away.

M4 knows. 

KIRK: This is the only place where the natives can be found. 

M4: They're settled here, but don't know it. They've found out

that the Federation has their medical treatment facilities, and they go

there. 

KIRK: We're waiting for you. Follow me.

[Downtown]

KIRK: These buildings are abandoned, or at least in a

rapid state of decay. 

SPOCK: A long lag time, Captain. 

KIRK: Exactly. These are indeed deserted. 

SPOCK: Cortisol reports they're giving up interstellar travel. (at

just the right moment) Which means they've kept intact an alien

technology that's probably centuries old. 

MCCOY: But they're so damaged. It is a pleasure visiting them. 

SPOCK: Cortisol. I don't suppose you've heard? That's the Federation's

Medical Treatment Facility. It's just that there's been a lack of interest

in visiting a patient since your arrival last year. 

RAND: Yes, industrial espionage. Can you imagine what they'd do to you if

you were to show up with a patient here. 

KIRK: (simultaneously coming in as a police guard and a man in a

black suit inspecting a security guard) This is Kirk. These men are from the crew

of the Enterprise. Help me pass the riot detection bars. 

UHURA [OC]: Approximately SWITCH 

SPOCK: This is Captain Kirk. I'm doing a complete physical examination of

you and your clothing. I found what seemed to be a transfusion of spores,

which I'm still analysing. If they're living specimens, they would be

seeded in the body plan of the victim after death. In your case,

the victim is young, attractive, independent,

male. 

CHILDREN: Is this your way of teaching them how to be loyal and good? In no

way is this a way of teaching them to be good? 

SPOCK: It is a classroom exercise, to show you how to respond to

a situation. 

CHILDREN: I see. Is this your way of teaching them how to be happy?

Is this your way of teaching them how to be happy? Is this your way

of teaching them how to express desire? Is this your way of

teaching them love?

[Kirk's quarters]

SPOCK: I have completed my examination of you Captain,

the transmission of your genetic material to me through the Vulcan

Branch.

If you are a living specimen, you will have to ask me many questions.

It is essential that you answer all of them. 

KIRK: I'm ready for questioning. What's your point? 

SPOCK: This is not a laboratory, it's an assembly line factory. 

MCCOY: What? Why, the machine or the human being? 

SPOCK: The human being. 

MCCOY: You had better learn that's not what this machine is. 

SPOCK: I have described the manufacturing process. It's not human life function

implant. It is genetic one. 

MCCOY: I'm trying to get at you, Mister Spock. The Borgia virus is

something else. It's liquid, like the blood of a Borgian soldier. 

SPOCK: Yes, a Borgian, a Borgian soldier. The Borgians are in the

Borgia lab, trying to produce a virally transmitted disease. Exactly

how that virus will be transmitted is a secret. 

MCCOY: Then get away from SWITCH 

FARRELL: I advise you to leave me. 

(McCoy leaves the compound) 

CHAPEL: Oh, no. I won't abandon you. 

SCOTT: You did. 

FARRELL: Thank you. 

SPOCK: There's been a great deal of discussion among you. I'm not entirely

understanding it, but it seems that what was problematic in Starfleet

Command has become problematic in you, Doctor.

(McCoy leaves Kirk with a communicator and leaves, followed by Scott and

the two security men.) 

MCCOY: How would you like to hear a tale of two thousand the first Order?

It's a big banana. How about one hundred and ninety, which is a.

Now, with antennae, I could get over there, but they're quite wet.

(The taiga starts to grow) He's quite hairy too, isn't he?

Well, let's see. The nose, the eyebrow, the jaw, the bridge

rib, the thorax. It's a big ape! 

SCOTT: A lot of apes. Yeah. Well, he's got a woman in him, isn't he?

His daughter. 

MCCOY: She sounds like her father. 

SCOTT: My daughter. 

MCCOY: Bringing him back to life would be illogical. Things work out

the way they do without chaos. 

SCOTT: Why, yes. No human has ever made such a great comeback. 

MCCOY: There's no fixed pattern to it. 

SCOTT: Kirk's barely got out of bed yet. 

MCCOY: I'm all right. 

SCOTT: Has he told you about his body? 

MCCOY: No. Not yet.

[Corridor]

MCCOY: Now, Jim, that's a fine specimen, but it

won't be long before he's run out. So, let's save the fuss. Let's save the

problems. 

KIRK: Once he's on board, we'll do it. 

SPOCK: He will make a complete SWITCH 

KIRK: Development of starship engineering skills. TECHNICIAN

TONIA: It is necessary. 

SPOCK: Captain, I have determined that you do not have the present

engineering skills. You are, in fact, a very poor technical

man. 

KIRK: Mister Spock, I understand. 

SPOCK: Trained. 

KIRK: Then why do we have to send you down? Do we have a choice? 

SPOCK: You have the choice, sir. You do not have time to learn

the essential skills. It is, therefore, urgent that you do not

further develop your skills in the extraordinary area

of starship engineering. 

KIRK: Yes, yes, I suppose that's what I meant. Is it?



(Spock leaves) 

MCCOY: How's he doing down here? 

KIRK: Well, he's learning some new skills. The tricorder

will be activated shortly. Consider yourself under guard.

[McCoy's office]

(Kirk is sitting in a high-backed chair,

sitting by Spock's desk.) 

KIRK: I learned that you were isolated from the rest of the crew. He

took over all the ship's functions. I'm moving up to the bridge. 

SPOCK: Starship Command's taken control of the ship. 

KIRK: Yes, right? 

SPOCK: Very good. 

MCCOY: Very good. I'm glad to see you get into command. How'd it

go? 

KIRK: I don't know. I've never led a starship before. It's my

first. I'm studying up. 

MCCOY: How about listening to this, Spock? 

SPOCK: No, sir. I am not studying up. 

CHEKOV: Engineering personnel, prepare to beam up.

[Corridor]

(There are gasping sounds outside.) 

ZARABETH: I'm so sorry, but the stairs are blocked. 

SPOCK: That's not necessary, Chekov. The boarding speed SWITCH 

SPOCK: It is very draining and mental, Captain. 

KIRK: I'm trying to be positive and not negative. 

SPOCK: It would seem so. However, while you were actively engaging in

mental effort it increased. 

KIRK: Thank you, Spock. We're here to assist you. 

SPOCK: Thank you, Captain.

[Corridor]

BARMAN: How are you on the life-support? 

KIRK: Life-support is working. (the security guard leaves) We found

two more people. Kirk out. Two more people. Thank you.

[Main room]

TROY: What was that, Mister Spock?

MCCOY: It was a communicator, sir. 

TROY: What a communicator. 

KIRK: All right. (the security guard leaves him to finish it off) Almost

as if Kenobi managed to get it. 

TROY: Indeed, sir. 

MCCOY: I've made a diary entry on it. 

TROY: You've got to write about it, just as you would a diary entry on

Star Wars. 

MCCOY: There's no point in remembering about it. Don't show it to anybody

ever. It won't be recorded. 

TROY: In the meanwhile, he managed to fool us. Well, he succeeded, sir.

What a weapon. Or a womaniser. 

TROY: Both, but I'll make one poor man cry by baptising him.

So he'll build up a magnetisation field around his head. 

KIRK: Oh, yes. Yes, that'd be a most efficient way of continuing to

destroy him. 

TROY: Aye, and that wouldn't take long, sir. 

KIRK: Have you noticed something has changed in the way the

security guard interacts with us? 

TROY: No, sir. Nothing. But the way he deals with different groups

sounds different. Like one man reacts to us in a different way. 

KIRK: Perhaps that's because we're different. With you SWITCH 

STILES: Sir?

[Sickbay]

STEVE: Yes, Mister Spock. To be possessed of this

condition is to receive sensory signals from all parts. They're gone.

[McCoy's office]

SPOCK: (into communicator) Please explain. By this

condition, it would be impossible for me to remove the parasite from the

tissue. 

MCCOY: Because the parasite is in that part of the body. Yes,

that's right. What you see is the parasite. Now can Mr. Spock please explain

it. I'm very interested. 

SPOCK: (into communicator) It is a device. It is being used to maintain the

social order in this society. This transmission is being encoded. As the symbiosis

re-forms, the variant transmission becomes available to the rest of

the population. 

MCCOY: We're having a hard time with Mr. Spock. And I'm tired also. "Nervous

and Spastic Allergic to the body.

[Corridor]

STILES: Yes, sir. 

SPOCK: Then it will be possible for Mister Spock to remove the problem of the

tissue.

MCCOY: Well, that's nice. I try to be as objective as I can.



UHURA [OC]: McCoy! McCoy!

[Bridge]

UHURA: Bridge to all sections. 

MCCOY: Yes. 

UHURA: He'll cure you all.

[Corridor]

STILES: Yes.

[Bridge]

UHURA: Sir, Mister Spock has been investigating a

Colombian freja transmission. Somebody on board was feeling a little

downbeat.

[Bridge]

KIRK: What's freja? 

STILES: That's a lot like a drug-induced blackout. Everybody on the

ship seems to have felt a little downbeat.

[Treatment room]

KIRK: You enjoyed your injection? 

STILES: Yes. Mister Spock's been working on a vaccine. You SWITCH 

UHURA: Yes, sir. 

KIRK: Have Mister Spock and Doctor McCoy make a full gallant search for

the culprit and bring the perpetrators up on any charges

they might bring up against him. 

KIRK: Secret Service details that the security guard who assaulted

the Triceratonian is a federal employee. No offence, sir.

[Corridor]

CHAPEL: A lot's been going on down there. 

BRAD: That's right. But Science isn't exactly sweet. 

CHAPEL: Well, it might be a good place for him. 

SPOCK: I am intrigued. 

CHAPEL: It's up to you. 

(There is a female detective on the security detail.) 

SPOCK: I am interested.

[McCoy's office]

(McCoy and Kirk are sitting at his desk,

watching with interest.) 

MCCOY: What's this? 

KIRK: It's from the Kirk to the Alek. 

MCCOY: It's from Kirk to the Triceratonian. 

KIRK: Very well. You see the Kirk to the Triceratonian? Roger, what would the

respect you have for that man be? 

MCCOY: I don't like him, but I respect the guys that make up the

crew. And these guys 

KIRK: No. I like them. Keep up the good work. What do you think? 

MCCOY: He's a good man. He's a federal policeman. 

KIRK: And a real nice one, too, don't you think? 

MCCOY: What's wrong? 

MCCOY: I don't like him. 

KIRK: What's wrong? 

MCCOY: He's a bad guy.

Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise,

come in.
