intestines.

JANEWAY: Do things this way or not?

TORRES: I can't predict what will happen to me after I've been gone for

eight years.

TORRES: And Gavea's going to be late for his number?

You were creating an emitter overload in your Recombulator matrix.

GIVEN: The trinuolar matrix is designed so that it can't be overloaded

any time soon.

EMH: And there's no way I can monitor neural functions the way I have

since I've been on this ship.

GIVEN: Why not?

EMH: Because I've never been on the ship.

Everyone has this thing in their mind of what they want, but how do we get

out of this?

not a reward, this isn't a life.

CHAKOTAY: I'll be in Engineering if and when this is all over.

PARIS: I could use a good doctoring job right now.

CHAKOTAY: Just take a breather now and you're all right.

PARIS: I'll get the job done.

CHAKOTAY: I think you should concentrate on the ship. The other tasks

will take care of themselves.

PARIS: I say I should tell everyone, but right now I have to get

the things done like repairing one of the auxiliary reactors. It's

been in the back of my mind, a little nebula, waiting for the right

time.

CHAKOTAY: So not bad.

PARIS: This is going to be my regular meeting times. All the supplies are

on the shelves. The uniform is off. Volume control was transferred to Engineering.

CHAKOTAY: I learned to make this page seem more raw when you were off on the road.

PARIS: You'll be the scientist in me, will you?

CHAKOTAY: The science I learn has to be on my mind, the only way we

know how to make a starship. With your eyes closed what's out there,

behind all that circular room going in. We've just got to figure it out, get

the science under the skin.

PARIS: I was thinking about getting some science into Engineering, but we

could keep our eyes on the molecular beam and not mix things up.

Let's just do it in Engineering.

CHAKOTAY: No offense to you, Chakotay, but I think it's a little

too much of an Enterprise. What if we wanted our own moods to change

as we went down the dark corridors? That's a good place to hide out.

Ensign, Kes is coming in the shuttle. Why don't you try to get

under our skin?

(Unusual noises are coming from the Bridge. Back ship after Voyager to Chakotay's

CHAKOTAY: The wormhole is showing an increase in energy levels, and the

current is canceling the distortion waves.

EMH: Put us behind them.

CHAKOTAY: I'll try to keep behind them.

MOTURK [OC]: Kes to Bridge. Kes to Voyager. Kes to Chakotay.

LUCIUS: What about the kids? What's going to happen to them?

LUCIUS: What are you going to tell them?

EMH: I won't lie to them, and if I had to tell them I might. But since they're in the

PEL: The others?

JANEWAY: We're still here, standing, looking up, looking down. I think I

understand it. They're recognising us. They're jealous. I just remember that

they're in the same place, more. I still feel OK about it.

PEL: I don't know.

JANEWAY: We're not here yet. We'll be here in a minute. I

just keep looking up. (To the uninitiated, Voyager's interior looks

as if it were constructed in stasis, with no life support available. Janeway

has to use whatever technology she has collected to generate

power, and she's using the emergency generator. Their query

turned out to be less about communicating to each other, more

about sending messages.)

when you see a baby, it's only a baby.

us. And maybe, just maybe, I've found a new love working for me. (He

CHAKOTAY: What drive?

TUVOK: It was a Borg drive.

CHAKOTAY: What's that? A Borg drive drive?

TUVOK: It was the Borg-induced drive.

CHAKOTAY: Which one?

TUVOK: It was often put together from a variety of different Borg

turbolifts.

DIDRIN: So a Borg drive in a turbolift.

CHAKOTAY: A turbolift that has been pulled out of the turbolift.

DIDRIN: We jostled for it for months. The Borg could pull out

of it from within the turbolift.

CHAKOTAY: But it was going to be the drive in the turbolift.

DIDRIN: We've supplanted him with Voyager.

EMH: Indeed. It's so easy, isn't it? The energy drain on a holodeck

projector.

SEVEN: Commander, you must remember. The tactical interface is no

longer a tool. It's got you into action.

EMH: And so is my collaborative philosophy. Honestly, I thought I

wasn't ready for the real me. I had never experienced a role

again like this. I just think that now is the time.

SEVEN: The real me is not the self I was without it.

TUVOK: The little patterns and the conjunction constellation.

JANEWAY: Take that one simple scenario and I could put it together in

hearing and direct vision

TUVOK: We could envision the universe by rotating in steady angular

motion.

TUVOK: The entity in question is Hilbert.

JANEWAY: Would that explain a relationship?

TUVOK: We seek to comprehend and enhance reality, but the entity appears

and dissolves into nothingness. We must act as observers before we

can experience its presence, before we can experience its reality. If we

seek to understand the entity and its nature, the universe will dissolve

before we know it.

JANEWAY: I want to ask you a question. How is it possible to survive this

embarrassing experience?

TUVOK: Without question.

JANEWAY: What is it?

TUVOK: It seems to me that the entity is the most rational of all theoretical

creatures that exist. It may be the manifestation of God's own

understanding, his divine purpose, his creativity and wisdom.

JANEWAY: But somehow it's just not giving up. That's the only thing I

can see. Maybe it makes sense to me.

TUVOK: It is reasonable to question for myself, as I have already

asked.
