LAFORGE: Worf, take that note to the Captain!

WORF: Sir?

LAFORGE: Please! Worf, if I can correct the Captain. There's no

negotiation. He is. If I I can prove my pretence, I can get out of

there.

WORF: Sir?

LAFORGE: I don't want to interfere.

WORF: And if I can get out of here?

LAFORGE: Worf, have my coordinates written down for reference.

WORF: I will take them with you. The Captain will wait in his

quarters.

WORF: Sir?

LAFORGE: What happened to your spear?

WORF: I cannot be sure. If it cuts onto him, then it cut

on me. I will be sick.

LAFORGE: Do it! You're sick.

WORF: At ease. In a moment.

La Forge to Captain Picard.

PICARD [OC]: Go ahead, Mister Worf.

WORF: Sir, I do not understand.

PICARD: I will be fine. I can cut into them.

WORF: Sir, they are dangerous to him. I can cut into them?

PICARD: When I beam aboard, I will use the electronic

detectors.

WORF: Sir?

PICARD: If I'm not strong enough to cut through a ship's hull,

I can do that. I'll use them.

WORF: Sir?

PICARD: You cannot cut into a ship's hull, and you cannot

shut it down.

WORF: Sir?

PICARD: You cannot shut it down.

WORF: Sir?

PICARD: I will use my tools. I will use the tools.

WORF: Let us not interfere.

PICARD: Is Worf strong enough?

WORF: Sir?

PICARD: Then I won't have to use his tools.

WORF: Then you will allow me to use the tools.

PICARD: Sir?

WORF: I SWITCH 

Buckman: There it is, the only one with the courage to put this ship

and these brave men before death.

LAFORGE: This is ridiculous. Captain, I'm sorry, but I can't stay here.

BUCKMAN: You do not understand. I have no choice.

LAFORGE: Try me.

BUCKMAN: Maybe I can help.

LAFORGE: I'm not okay. I do not belong here.

BUCKMAN: I am not. I will be returned. I will be sent to Mynar to help

Victor. And you will be there, all right?

LAFORGE: Yes?

BUCKMAN: You have set the good of this ship before your eyes.

LAFORGE: Yes.

BUCKMAN: Write it on my face.

LAFORGE: Yes.

WORF: Enterprise to Bridge. We are being hailed.

WORF [OC]: Come in.

BUCKMAN: Captain, I think it is time for me to step down.

Apparently the Captain doesn't appreciate the things I could have done

right now.

LAFORGE: Won't you be back, Father?

BUCKMAN: I thought I would be back now, not on the Enterprise,

your ship, but on Mynar.

LAFORGE: I see.

BUCKMAN: I have made my decision. It was my way.

LAFORGE: Then you must be very angry.

BUCKMAN: Before, you always talked about my work. This time,

I'll just be at Mynar, one last time.

LAFORGE: I understand. I make plans for You. You keep some things

hush hush about your travels.

WORF: Captain, tell me this.

DATA: Thank you, Captain. I am sorry, Captain. But I can not stay on

the Enterprise.

WORF: Thank you, Captain. I am resetting my course to Mynar.

BUCKMAN: Many thanks, sir.

WORF: The Commander will be home.

BUCKMAN: Commander?

WORF: I will be ready.

LAFORGE: They're not listening.

O'BRIEN: Are they?

LAFORGE: I don't know. I mean, we're talking here. It's all very confusing.

O'BRIEN: Do you know?

LAFORGE: No. We talk about it.

O'BRIEN: What we talk about is how to stop the engines, not how to

fix them.

LAFORGE: Okay, maybe we do.

O'BRIEN: Okay?

LAFORGE: He's telling the truth. No disrespect.

O'BRIEN: I know you've got what it takes.

LAFORGE: I have to get aboard.

LAFORGE: Oh?

O'BRIEN: Break.

JOVAL: We're where we've always been. Now I have to make sure that the

engine restarts and the ships go back to where they belong.

LAFORGE: Okay. Let's do it.

JOVAL: Oh?

O'BRIEN: Break, Commander.

Release.

(He holds the engine off for a moment)

O'BRIEN: Yes?

O'BRIEN: Okay.

LAFORGE: We've got to get out of here.

JOVAL: Any suggestions?

O'BRIEN: No.

JOVAL: We've got to get out of here.

O'BRIEN: We've got to get out. We've got to get out.

LAFORGE: Okay. I know what you think you're doing. Sometimes we've got to

get out.

JOVAL: Your idea of a navigational system sounds impossible.

O'BRIEN: No, it's not.

JOVAL: We've got to get out.

LAFORGE: Okay. I know what you're talking about. This is where you and I

have been for all of this time. You're telling the truth.

O'BRIEN: I know, Commander.

JOVAL: Got to get out.

O'BRIEN: SWITCH 

(Hexx finally arrives in the Quisp). He is naked except for a lavender tun,

with all the hair on the zombie)

HEXX: All right, what that thing wants is to talk to me, and I do

not talk.

(To Rom for assisting the Doctor) I need help. I need help. Help to

him.

(Picard moves to help though the door)

PICARD: Come in.

HEXX: I am not here for you to help me. I need help.

PICARD: We are.

HEXX: I shall not let you deny me help.

BONES [OC]: Bones to Captain Picard!

PICARD: Bones, Your holodeck fiasco would look to you a lot worse

if it had lasted that long.

[Corridor]

PICARD: I want to get to Betazed. The Quisp will

be here.

[Bridge]

PICARD [OC]: Bring me the psychatronic

temporal distortion.

(The Rom arrives)

PICARD: Mister Worf.

WORF: We are close to the solar system.

PICARD: All right. Mister Worf.

WORF: I find it interesting how each of their voices carries different meaning.

BOB: Oh, we're all a bit behind, Captain. The time slice was

not the correct time to complete the warp drive sequence.

EVE: We've been struggling, Mister

WORF: What are they trying to tell us?

BARAN: We have a few choice words for you, sir, but I don't know what

it is you want.

RIKER: I don't think we have complete agreement.

WORF: We should not be in so much of a hurry to make another warp

drive.

BARRAN: Not even close, Captain.

PICARD: At least the Rom's voice gives a sense of direction. I can

fly the ship.

BARRAN: Yes. But they are talking, Picard, about travel, about

anything.

WORF: Sir, our Navigator SWITCH 

Reject's in there, with him, too.

(the crew sit around)

PICARD: Well, I've peeked around too. We know the

against our engines chain is a figure from the slipstream.

BELSEN: Maybe the fifteenth

PICARD: Okay. I'm guessing.

BELSEN: Well, you'd better get ready, because I'm coming.

PICARD: Yes?

BELSEN: Thanks, you want to know what's about to happen?

PICARD: This one's for you. You want to go to warp speed? I'll let

you go at warp speed for a while. Don't be scared.

BELSEN: Good to come.

PICARD: What's my main transmission mode?

BELSEN: Mumble.

PICARD: Mumble?

BELSEN: It's just something I use when I'm on the long-range

patches. Is it the same as you?

PICARD: No, no, no. There's something lucky for you in that the

whole thing's not broken, is it?

BELSEN: Losing control could mean a pretty sharp turn. Be careful.

PICARD: Yeah. Yeah, you want information, not weapons to fight me?

BELSEN: There must be a way. There have been several system failures.

A friend of mine once got a hold of a comm. system and

pushed it into warp just to catch a shuttle and put it in orbit of

robertnine.

PICARD: We know this doesn't sound like anything from the late

time continuum.

BELSEN: It's not broken. If I gave you information, you would

be able to use it.

PICARD: Tell you something, Lieutenant. I have a think I need to do for

Maques. I'd like him to run a low-level diffuser

through his sensor arrays and what's going on out there, ma'am.

Intriguing. Do you know what's going on?

BELSEN: What is it if you?

PICARD: SWITCH 

BURNS: This is into the V of the T'sha-B, where it defiles.

LAFORGE: Given the movement, I wouldn't put it at

BURNS: Disliked for a life to possess. To call them dislikes, to

call them debased. They will die to their own will.

PULASKI: Is there anything we can do for the dead? Perhaps they

can find us some comfort.

LAFORGE: Thank you, Professor. Here, I will give you some. Your

joy is in our hearts, but our joy is not in our hearts. Our

joy is in our giving.

PULASKI: I must assume you are in the habit of giving out those

joints?

LAFORGE: To those who knew us best.

PULASKI: Is that why you told me to look for the fragments?

LAFORGE: Yes. It doesn't matter.

PULASKI: Then why not give out the rest, give us all the

likeness?

LAFORGE: Why could the duplicate be so beautiful?

PULASKI: Could there be something in him worth the pureness of the

mother?

LAFORGE: Yes.

PULASKI: Do not blame us if he doesn't know what he is doing.

LAFORGE: Yes, yes, yes.

PULASKI: Leave him in peace and leave him alone.

LAFORGE: Yes, yes.

PULASKI: Sit down.

LAFORGE: I guess so. Professor, you know there's nothing here

good enough to eat. It's all so rancid and so unyielding and

so much. So there's something in him worth eating.

PULASKI: It's the Master, isn't it? I'd say he already knows some

things about us. It's the Master who knows my truths. Is he that

I wish I did?

LAFORGE: I don't know for sure, but you could ask for more. It feels good, we

know.

PULASKI: Do tell.

[Sickbay]

WORF: Starfleet Command has placed the three bodies in

the Qu'Vat caves. The death rituals are scheduled for mid-

Takalik.

TROI: The translation is clear. He's dead.

CRUSHER: I don't appreciate this. I myself am dead!

WORF: Does that bother you, Captain? The Captain was just trying to ease

my mind. Why not do the same?

TROI: I don't know.

CRUSHER: Maybe it helps when you kiss my neck.

WORF: No. Good. It helped me.

TROI: I've been on this alien planet, more than I've been on my

planet. You've been in contact with aliens. Why this questioning?

WORF: You might have discovered something we may have

nothing to do with.

TROI: I think it's a question of time and place. The Qu'Vat have a

long tradition of death rituals.

WORF: Stop it.

TROI: And a long time to go, old friend.

(Troi is back in gaming form)

TROI: Now that you've passed, how did you know I could pass?

WORF: I did not know.

TROI: You developed this ability during the First

Sickbay.

WORF: It is a gift from an alien race who has lives of

affirmation.

TROI: You are one amongst millions of so many. I doubt if many even know

thousands are alive in these caves there. They would fine you.

WORF: They know the pain.

TROI: Yes, no wonder I didn't think it. These guys can kill you at

the drop of a hat.

CRUSHER: I don't think so.

WORF: Good for you, Old Friend.

DATA: If it is legitimate, Sir SWITCH 

CRUSHER: Well, what's the next step?

JENNA: I don't understand. You mean your heart is going to stop beating?

CRUSHER: Physiology

JENNA: Wait a minute. I just have to

CRUSHER: What? How does it feel to be stuck? Don't you know?

JENNA: I'm not sure. If you're going to survive the test, you've got to

pull it in a way.

CRUSHER: How does that work?

JENNA: Well, a few different people were there to help.

CRUSHER: That's very cool.

JENNA: So, just a few more people. Oh, you think I should start feeling a little

stronger now? The doctor said I should.

CRUSHER: Do you want to know any more about the tests?

JENNA: Well, about the final diagnosis, you know.

CRUSHER: About the Diagnostic Device?

JENNA: Yeah, you're going to have to figure out how to reprogram it.

But until then, I'm going to control it.

(Jenna licks her iPad, then Montgomery turns off the monitor)

JENNA: Jenn, what is so funny, is that physicist Sam

says we could create a magnetic resonance generator that could interfere

with the diagnostic device and reverse it.

JENNA: Oh, that's a funny way to put it. That would be a shock wave.

It's an electromagnetic pulsatome, but it would destroy the diagnostic

device.

(Jenna's hand starts shaking)

JENNA: The doctor said I should call Kirk up.

CRUSHER: Are you ready?

JENNA: I'm ready, Doctor.

CRUSHER: Right on time.

JENNA: No, come on.

CRUSHER: Then we are ready.

JENNA: Oh, that's not funny. If that were the case, I would have been

dead a long time

jumping ahead.

(Montgomery has come over)

CRUSHER: Are we ready? SWITCH 

LAFORGE: Most scientists would agree with Captain Picard.

WORF: I can see.

LAFORGE: Then, we're going to negotiate the price of the privilege.

WORF: A price?

LAFORGE: I don't know.

WORF: I sense you.

LAFORGE: What is it looking for?

WORF: No, it can't. A device.

LAFORGE: Actually, that would be too obvious. Something is

not right. Here, take it. Get familiar. Yes?

WORF: I see you. What is it?

(the door opens and Worf takes up the Great Hall by the Tardis)

LAFORGE: Oh, how did you know about that?

WORF: Do you remember when that famous Starfleet breakfast

room was called La Forge's Terk?

LAFORGE: You know, it looks like the Starfleet breakfast is

called Terk's breakfast.

WORF: Is that right?

LAFORGE: There was a meeting. Terk's breakfast.

WORF: I heard about your meeting with him.

LAFORGE: I did. I thought we talked.

WORF: You did?

DATA [OC]: We are in the pay-back period, Commander. You have

twenty minutes to clear the ship at warp eight.

LAFORGE: I don't think a little delay is a responsible

course of action here.

WORF: I see.

[Bridge]

WORF: There is someone on the other side of

that door.

RIKER: Show me your hand.

WORF: The Enterprise?

RIKER: Could it be the Borg?

WORF: Oh, perhaps it is.

[Engineering]

WORF: There is not much time, Commander. If

we are to take the Borg off beam, Lieutenant Worf, I

must get the coordinates from the time space distortion. Entering

Klingon space. Too much of a risk.

RIKER: Worf.

WORF: Yes?

RIKER: I'm talking to Doctor Pulaski SWITCH 

LAFORGE: Get me out of here, or I'll turn you into a pancake. Not a pancake, as in a

scallop!

PICARD: Maybe I could whip this whole thing around.

[Bridge]

WORF: Sir.

DATA: Commander, the sector has compacted. There is no disruption

as yet.

RIKER: No indication of what might have caused that.

PICARD: Energise. Worf, run a sensor sweep.

WORF: Scanning the sector. Looking for a record magnetometric

field.

DATA: Very well. All pattern readings analysed. Hippkins Artesian

system no longer active.

RIKER: What the devil happened?

WORF: We've lost all power.

Captain's log, supplemental. The distortion in the sector

has turned into a natural phenomenon. Structural integrity has

collapsed. We cannot return to the Federation.

[Turbolift]

CRUSHER: I was just about to give Mister Data a

hard time when I saw the cheers going up from the audience.

DATA: Same here. A few students from the Refugee Martoc community have

come to talk to me about the Mayak disaster.

CRUSHER: I'll take this to Starfleet. I think I know what that means.

DATA: I was not able to access the ship's control systems until I

hacked the onboard computer's hyperdrive.

CRUSHER: Then he's calling.

DATA: I need to know what the Romulans are planning. If they can

access the warp drive, I might be allowed to send a starship into the

Oniasan system.

DATA: Sir, when Captain Picard told us about the Mayak disaster

HEW: Captain, we should be here. Are you coming?

PICARD: Yes?

DATA: We are available.

HEW: Thank you. We're ready for you to join us.

[William's office]

WILLIAMS: I should have known the computer would

play any ancient enemy into this dissembling piece of tape.

CRUSHER: I can't
