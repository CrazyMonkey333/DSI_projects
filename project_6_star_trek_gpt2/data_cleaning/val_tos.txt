(Elsewhere, D'Amato is wandering amongst the purple tipped vegetation

and picking up

handfuls of sand. He turns around and there is the woman.) 

LOSIRA: Do not be afraid. 

D'AMATO: I'm not. Geological disturbances don't frighten me. I've come

here to study them. My specialty. 

LOSIRA: I know. You are Lieutenant D'Amato, Senior Geologist. 

D'AMATO: That's right. How did you know that? 

LOSIRA: From the spaceship Enterprise. 

D'AMATO: Yes, and we're stranded here. You been talking to my friends? 

LOSIRA: Do not be afraid. 

D'AMATO: I'm not afraid. 

LOSIRA: I am for you, Lieutenant D'Amato. 

D'AMATO: You're, you're the woman on the Enterprise. 

LOSIRA: I am only for D'Amato. 

D'AMATO: Lucky D'Amato. I want to have a conference about sharing your

food and water. 

LOSIRA: Do not call the others. Please. 

(Somewhere else, McCoy gets out his communicator.) 

MCCOY: McCoy to Kirk. 

KIRK: Kirk here. 

MCCOY: Jim, I just got a life form reading of tremendous intensity.

Suddenly it was just there. 

KIRK: What do you mean just there? 

MCCOY: Just that. All levels were normal, then I get this biological

surge of life form registering. No, now it's gone.Â 

KIRK: As though a door opened and closed. 

MCCOY: Yes. 

KIRK: What direction? 

MCCOY: Zero eight three. 

KIRK: Hang on. D'Amato's section. Come in. Kirk to D'Amato. Come in.

Come in. Bones, Sulu, D'Amato doesn't answer. 

MCCOY: I'll be right there. 

(Kirk arrives first. We see a pair of legs with boots lying face down

behind a rock.) 

KIRK: Bones! 

(McCoy runs in and examines the body.) 

MCCOY: Jim, every cell in his body's been disrupted. 

(Sulu arrives. Kirk adjusts his phaser.) 

MCCOY: Jim, what are you doing? 

KIRK: Digging a grave. 

SULU: Poor D'Amato. What a terrible way to die. 

KIRK: There are no good ways, Sulu. 

(Kirk phasers the ground, but it only cuts a shallow trench in the

soil.) 

SULU: That's the same red rock. 

KIRK: My phaser didn't cut through it. 

MCCOY: Whatever it is, it has a mighty high melting point. 

KIRK: Eight thousand degrees centigrade. It looks like igneous rock,

but infinitely denser. 

(Adjusts his phaser and tries again.) 

MCCOY: This whole planet must be made up of this substance, covered

over by top soil. 

KIRK: Mister Sulu, it might explain this place a little better if we

knew what the substance is. I know it was D'Amato's field, but see what

you can find out. 

SULU: Yes, sir. 

MCCOY: Well, I guess a tomb of rocks is the best we can provide for

D'Amato. 

KIRK: Yeah. It might be the most suitable memorial at that. 

MCCOY: I wonder what killed him. 

KIRK: I don't know, but something or someone did.

[Bridge]

RAHDA: We're holding warp eight point four, sir. If

we can maintain it, our estimated time of arrival is eleven and one

half solar hours. 

SPOCK: Eleven point three three seven hours, Lieutenant. I wish you

would be more precise.

[Engineering]

SCOTT: Scott to Bridge. Scott to Bridge.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Spock here.

[Bridge]

SCOTT: Mister Spock, the ship feels wrong.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Feels, Mister Scott?

[Engineering]

SCOTT: I know it doesn't make sense.

Instrumentation reads correct, but the feel is wrong.

[Bridge]

SCOTT [OC]: It's something I can't quite put into

words. 

SPOCK: That is obvious, Mister Scott. I suggest you avoid emotionalism

and simply keep your instruments correct.

[Engineering]

SPOCK [OC]: Spock out.

[Planet surface]

(The cairn is complete, and topped off with a

name-stone.) 

SULU: It looks so lonely there. 

MCCOY: It would be worse if he had company. 

SULU: Doctor, how can you joke about it? 

MCCOY: I'm not joking. Until we know what killed him, none of us are

safe. 

KIRK: We've got to figure this out and devise a defence against it. Is

it possible that the rocks have life? 

SULU: You remember on Janus Six, the silicon creatures 

MCCOY: But our instruments recorded that. They were life forms. They

registered as life forms. 

KIRK: Unless we're dealing with beings, intelligent beings who can

shield themselves. 

SULU: Beings intelligent enough to have destroyed the Enterprise? 

KIRK: That's the problem, Sulu. We have only questions. No answers.

[Engineering]

(Scott is trying to track down the source of his

feeling, and a man in a red boiler suit keeps looking over his

shoulder.) 

SCOTT: Watkins, check the bypass valve on the matter/antimatter

reaction chamber. Make sure it's not overheating. 

WATKINS: But, Mister Scott, the board shows correct. 

SCOTT: I didn't ask you to check the board, lad. 

WATKINS: Yes, sir. 

(Watkins goes off into an adjoining room and checks a console and some

panels in there. Then he is confronted by Losira.) 

WATKINS: Who are you? 

LOSIRA: My name is not important. Yours is Watkins, John B. Engineer

Grade four. 

WATKINS: You know all about me. I've never seen you before. 

LOSIRA: Show me this unit. I wish to learn. 

WATKINS: This is the matter-antimatter integrator control. That's the

cut off switch. 

LOSIRA: Not correct. That is the emergency overload bypass, which

engages almost instantaneously. A wise precaution, considering it takes

the antimatter longer to explode once the magnetic flow fails. I am for

you, Mister Watkins. 

WATKINS: Mister Scott, there's a strange woman who knows the entire

plan of the Enterprise. 

(But by the time Scott gets there, Watkins has screamed and Losira has

turned sideways into a vertical line, then vanished.) 

SCOTT: Oh, you poor lad. Scott to bridge. Scott to bridge.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Spock here. 

SCOTT [OC]: My assistant, Watkins, is dead. 

SPOCK: Do you know what he died of, Mister Scott? 

SCOTT: I didn't see it happen, but his last words were a warning cry

about some strange woman. 

SPOCK: Security alert, all decks. Female intruder, extremely dangerous.

Security alert. All decks.

[Planet surface]

(Dusk is falling, the sky is a dark purple.) 

KIRK; Conclusions. 

SULU: The basic substance of this planet is an alloy of

diburnium-osmium. It couldn't have evolved naturally. 

MCCOY: Captain, it doesn't make sense. In fact, nothing about this

planet makes sense. 

KIRK: Except for a momentary fluctuation on your instruments, this

planet has no magnetic field. The apparent age of these rocks is only a

few thousand years. No known process could evolve the plant life they

have here in that short space of time. 

MCCOY: Are you suggesting this might be an artificial planet? 

SULU: But Captain, where are the people who made it? Why can't we see

them? 

KIRK: The planet might be hollow. They might be shielding themselves

from our sensor probes. It's dark. Let's get some rest. Tomorrow we

have to find some food and some water or it's going to be a very

unpleasant stay. 

MCCOY: While it lasts. 

SULU: I'll take the first watch, sir. 

KIRK: All right. Take D'Amato's tricorder. Set it for automatic

distress. You never can tell. 

SULU: Aye, sir. 

(Sulu sets up the tricorder on a rock ledge, and leaves it beeping away

to itself.)

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Spock to Sickbay. Have you completed the

autopsy on Watkins, Doctor? 

M'BENGA [OC]: Yes, we have, Mister Spock. 

SPOCK: Was the cause of his death the same as that which killed the

transporter officer?

[McCoy's office]

M'BENGA: Well, the pattern of cellular disruption

was the same, but as to the cause, well your guess is as good as mine.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: My guess, Doctor, would be valueless. I

suggest we refrain from guessing and find some facts.

[McCoy's office]

SPOCK [OC]: Spock out.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: The power of this intruder to disrupt every

cell in a body, combined with the almost inconceivable power required

to hurl the Enterprise such a distance, speak of a very high culture

and a very great danger. 

SCOTT: You mean that one of the people who threw us a thousand light

years away from that planet is on board and killing our people? 

SPOCK: A reasonable assumption, Mister Scott. 

SCOTT: Then you're right, Mister Spock. Watkins must've been murdered.

I sent him in to check the matter-antimatter reactor. There are no

exposed circuits there. It couldn't have been anything he touched. 

SPOCK: If there are more of those beings on that planet, the captain

and the others are in very great danger.

[Planet surface]

(While Kirk and McCoy sleep, Losira turns off the

tricorder. Sulu confronts her.) 

LOSIRA: I am unarmed. 

SULU: Who are you? 

LOSIRA: That is not important. You are Lieutenant Sulu. You were born

on the planet Earth. You're helmsman for the Enterprise. 

SULU: How do you know this? Where did you get this information? Are you

from this planet? 

LOSIRA: I am from here. 

SULU: Then the planet is hollow. Who killed Lieutenant D'Amato? All

right. The captain will want to talk to you. That way. Move! 

LOSIRA: You do not understand. I have come for you. 

SULU: What do you want? 

LOSIRA: I want to touch you. 

SULU: You were on the Enterprise. Keep back! Stop or I'll shoot! I

don't want to have to kill a woman. 

(Sulu fires his phaser at her feet, then at her. It has no effect.) 

SULU: Captain Kirk! Captain Kirk! 

(As he backs away, Sulu falls over a stone. Losira manages to brush his

shoulder before he gets away, screaming in pain, and Kirk steps in

front of her.) 

KIRK: Hold it! Who are you? 

LOSIRA: I am for him. I am for Lieutenant Sulu. 

SULU: Don't let her touch you, Captain! That's how D'Amato died.

Phasers won't stop her. 

LOSIRA: I am for Lieutenant Sulu. Please, I must touch him. 

(She puts her hand on Kirk's shoulder, but it doesn't hurt him. He

pushes her away.) 

KIRK: How can you destroy others and not me? 

LOSIRA: I don't want to destroy. I don't want to. 

KIRK: Who are you? Why are you trying to kill us? 

LOSIRA: Only Sulu. I mean you no harm. 

KIRK: Are there men on this planet? 

LOSIRA: Please, I must touch him. I am for Lieutenant Sulu. 

KIRK: No! 

(Losira goes two-dimensional, then vanishes.) 

KIRK: Bones, did you see that? Maybe Spock was wrong. Perhaps this is a

ghost planet. 

MCCOY: Well, all I know is she almost made a ghost out of Sulu. His

shoulder, where she touched it, every cell's been disrupted. Exploded

from within. If she'd really gotten a good grip on him, Jim. 

SULU: How can such people be, Captain? Such evil and she's so, so

beautiful. 

KIRK: Yes, I know.

[Bridge]

UHURA: Security sweeps of all decks are negative,

Mister Spock. No evidence of intruder. 

SPOCK: Very well. Cancel Red Alert but maintain increased security. 

UHURA: Aye, sir. All decks, cancel Red Alert. Maintain increased

security. 

SPOCK: Please update our subspace report to Starfleet to include

security search, results negative. 

UHURA: How did she get off the ship, sir? 

SPOCK: Presumably the same way she got on. 

UHURA: Yes, sir. Mister Spock what are the chances of the captain and

the others being alive? 

SPOCK: Lieutenant, we are not engaged in gambling. We are proceeding in

the only logical way to return to the place they were last seen, and

factually ascertain whether or not they still live. 

UHURA: Yes, Mister Spock. 

RAHDA: Mister Spock, speed is increased to warp eight point eight. 

SCOTT: Bridge to Engineering. 

SCOTT [OC]: Scotty here. I see it.

[Engineering]

SCOTT: It's a power surge. I'm working on it.

Reduce speed until I locate the trouble.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Very well. Reduce speed to warp seven. 

RAHDA: Aye, sir. Warp seven. Mister Spock, our speed has increased to

warp eight point nine and still climbing. 

SPOCK: Bridge to Engineering. Negative effect on power reduction. Speed

is still increasing.

[Engineering]

SCOTT: Aye, Mister Spock, and I found out why. The

emergency bypass control of the matter-antimatter integrator is fused.

[Bridge]

SCOTT [OC]: It's completely useless. The engines

are running wild. There's no way to get at them. We should reach

maximum overload in about fifteen minutes.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: I would calculate fourteen point eight seven

minutes, Mister Scott.

[Engineering]

SCOTT: Those few seconds will not make any

difference, Mister Spock, because you and I and the rest of the crew

will no longer be here to bandy it back and forth.

[Bridge]

SCOTT [OC]: This thing is going to blow up

[Engineering]

SCOTT: And there's nothing in the universe can stop

it.

[Planet surface]

MCCOY: There's a layer of necrotic tissue a few

cells thick. A normal wound would heal quickly. 

SULU: She just touched me. How could it happen so fast? 

KIRK: That's a good question. She touched the transporter chief. He

collapsed immediately. She apparently got to D'Amato.

We saw what happened to him. The question is, why are you alive? 

SULU: Captain, I'm happy the way it turned out. 

MCCOY: Jim, what kind of power must she have? 

KIRK: The power to totally disrupt biological cell structure. Sulu's

alive because I intervened. But that raises an even worse question. 

MCCOY: Yes. Why didn't she kill you? 

KIRK: She's not through yet.

[Engineering]

(Scott is working on the emergency bypass) 

SCOTT: It's useless. And there's no question it's deliberate. 

SPOCK: Sabotage. 

SCOTT: Aye, and a thorough job. The system's foolproof. Whoever

murdered Watkins sabotaged this. 

SPOCK: You said it was fused. How? 

SCOTT: That's what worries me. 

SPOCK: Worries, Mister Scott? 

SCOTT: Well, it's fused, all right, but it would take all the power of

our main phaser banks to do it. 

SPOCK: Interesting. 

SCOTT: I find nothing interesting in the fact that we're about to blow

up. 

SPOCK: No, but the method is fascinating. 

SCOTT: Whatever did this is still aboard this ship. I fail to

understand why you cancelled the security alert. 

SPOCK: A force that could hurl us nine hundred and ninety point seven

light years away and at that distance still be able to sabotage our

main source of energy

will not be waiting around to be taken into custody. 

SCOTT: Aye. 

SPOCK: As I recall the pattern of our fuel flow, there is an access

tube leading to the matter-antimatter reaction chamber. 

SCOTT: There's a service crawlway, but it's not meant to be used while

the integrator operates. 

SPOCK: Still, it is there, and it might be possible to shut off the

fuel at that point. 

SCOTT: What with? Bare hands? 

SPOCK: A magnetic probe. 

SCOTT: Any matter that comes in contact with antimatter triggers the

explosion. And I'm not even sure a man can live in the crawlway

in the energy stream of the magnetic field that bottles up the

antimatter. 

SPOCK: I shall try. 

SCOTT: You'll be killed, man! 

SPOCK: Unless a solution is found quickly, that fate awaits all of us. 

SCOTT: Aye. You're right. What have we got to lose? But I'll do it,

Mister Spock. I know every millimetre of that system.

I'll do whatever has to be done. 

SPOCK: Very well, Mister Scott. You spoke of the feel of the ship being

wrong. 

SCOTT: Aye. It was an emotional statement. I don't expect you to

understand it. 

SPOCK: I note it, Mister Scott, without necessarily understanding it. I

propose to run an analysis through the ship's computers,

comparing the present condition of the Enterprise with her ideal

condition. 

SCOTT: Mister Spock, we don't have time for that. 

SPOCK: We have twelve minutes and twenty seven seconds. I suggest you

do whatever you can in the service crawlway, while I make the computer

study.

[Planet surface]

KIRK: Lieutenant Sulu, do you feel strong enough to

move about? 

SULU: I feel fine, Captain. 

KIRK: Is he, Bones? 

MCCOY: He's in fair shape. 

KIRK: All right. Whatever destructive power this woman has seems to be

aimed at one specific person at one specific time.

If I'm correct, when she re-appears, the other two might protect the

one she's after by interposing their bodies. No weapons seem to affect

her. 

SULU: But Captain, how does she know about us? Does she read our minds?

(there's a whining sound) Phaser on overload! 

KIRK: Controls are fused. Drop! 

(He throws his phaser away, and it goes off with a big bang.) 

KIRK: Apparently she can destroy our weapons as well as destroy us.

Come on, let's go.

[Bottom of crawlway]

SCOTT: All right, lads. Get the crawlway door open.

Hand me the tools. Communicator. All right. Head first. I hope Mister

Spock knows what he's doing. 

(Scott is slid on his back into a half-sized Jefferies tube with blue

energy streaks crossing it.Â 

SCOTT: Scott to Bridge. 

SPOCK [OC]: Go ahead, Mister Scott. 

SCOTT: I've sealed off the aft end of the service crawlway, and I've

positioned explosive separator charges to blast me clear of the ship if

I rupture the magnetic bottle. I'm so close to the flow now it feels

like ants crawling all over my body.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Mister Scott, I suggest you refrain from any

further subjective descriptions. You now have ten minutes and nineteen

seconds in which to perform your task.

[Crawlway]

RAHDA [OC]: Mister Spock, we're at warp eleven

point two and accelerating. 

SCOTT: I heard that. The ship's not structured to take that speed for

any length of time.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: You now have ten minutes and ten seconds.

[Crawlway]

SCOTT: All right, Mister Spock. I'm starting to

open the access panel now.

[Bridge]

(Spock begins his computer study.) 

SCOTT [OC]: Access to the flow itself.

[Crawlway]

SCOTT: If the magnetic flow jumps, you must

jettison me. The safety control

[Bridge]

SCOTT [OC]: Will not hold more than two seconds if

I rupture the field. 

SPOCK: I'm aware of these facts. Please get on with the job. Computer. 

COMPUTER: Working. 

SPOCK: Analysis on my comparison co-ordinates. 

COMPUTER: Unable to comply. Comparison co-ordinates too complex for

immediate readout. Will advise upon completion.

[Crawlway]

SCOTT: I've removed the access plate, and I've got

static electric charges dancing on the instruments. Looks like an

aurora borealis in there.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura, you are monitoring the

magnetic force? 

UHURA: Oh yes, sir. 

SPOCK: Please do not take your eyes off of it. Lieutenant Rahda, arm

the pod jettison system. 

RAHDA: Aye, sir. I'll jettison the pod at the first sign of trouble. 

SPOCK: Not until my order. 

RAHDA: Yes, sir. Warp eleven point nine. 

SPOCK: Mister Scott, what is your situation?

[Crawlway]

SCOTT: It's hard to see. There's so much

disturbance that any attempt to get at the flow would rupture the

magnetic field.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: You have eight minutes, forty one seconds.

[Crawlway]

SCOTT: I know what time it is. I don't need a

blooming' cuckoo clock.

[Planet surface]

SULU: Captain, I'm getting that strange magnetic

sweep again, from zero to off the scale. 

KIRK: Yes. Like a door opening. 

(And suddenly Losira is there again.) 

KIRK: Who have you come for this time? 

LOSIRA: For you, James T. Kirk. Commander of the Enterprise. 

MCCOY: Keep behind us, Jim. 

KIRK: Why do you want to kill us? 

LOSIRA: For defence. You are Captain James T. Kirk, commander of the

Enterprise. 

KIRK: Then why do you want to kill me? 

LOSIRA: You are an invader. 

KIRK: We're here on a peaceful mission. It's you who have killed our

people. We mean no harm to you. We want to leave, peacefully. 

MCCOY: Captain, I'm getting no life form register. 

KIRK: An android? 

MCCOY: That would give a mechanical reading. I'm getting nothing. 

KIRK: Who are you? 

LOSIRA: I am Losira, Commander. 

KIRK: Commander of what? 

LOSIRA: Of this station. 

KIRK: Station? Station? Where? How do you feel about killing me? 

LOSIRA: Feel? Killing is wrong. 

KIRK: Stay between us. 

LOSIRA: You must not penetrate this station. Please, I must touch you. 

KIRK: You want to kill me? 

LOSIRA: No. 

KIRK: Then why do it if you don't want to? 

LOSIRA: I am sent. 

KIRK: By whom? 

LOSIRA: We defend this place. 

KIRK: Are there others on this planet? 

LOSIRA: They are no more. 

KIRK: How long have you been alone? Are you lonely? 

(She does her disappearing act.) 

SULU: She must be somewhere. 

MCCOY: She's not registering. 

KIRK: And there's this power surge, right off the scale. Like a door

closing. It must be near here. 

(They walk on.) 

MCCOY: Is the power level still holding, Jim? 

KIRK: Right off the scale. It's remained at a peak ever since she

disappeared. The entrance is here. 

(A section of rock slides back and a door opens.) 

MCCOY: You think we're being invited in? 

KIRK: It certainly looks like it. And the invitation doesn't exactly

relax me. 

SULU: I'd rather be on the Enterprise, sir. 

KIRK: I agree. 

MCCOY: We've been led here. Why? 

KIRK: I don't know. But whatever civilisation exists on this planet is

in there. And without the Enterprise, gentlemen,

the only source of food and water is in there. Let's go.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Computer read-out. 

COMPUTER: Comparison analysis complete. 

SPOCK: Continue. 

COMPUTER: Transporter factor M7 reassembled outphase point zero zero

zero nine. 

RAHDA: Fifty seven seconds to go. 

SPOCK: Understood. 

SCOTT [OC]: Mister Spock. 

SPOCK: Spock here.

[Crawlway]

SCOTT: I'm going to try to cut through the magnetic

flow. But if the probe doesn't precisely match the magnetic flow,

there'll be an explosion. Starting right now. 

UHURA: Magnetic force indicator jumping, Mister Spock. 

SPOCK: Mister Scott, ease off. 

UHURA: Magnetic force has dropped to normal, sir. 

RAHDA: Warp thirteen point two, sir. 

SPOCK: Computer, for outphase condition, will reverse field achieve

closure? 

COMPUTER: Affirmative, if M7 factor maintained. 

SPOCK: Mister Scott

[Crawlway]

SPOCK [OC]: Reverse polarity on your magnetic

probe. 

SCOTT: Reverse polarity? 

SPOCK [OC]: That is correct, Mister Scott. 

SCOTT: That'll take some doing. What purpose could it

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Please commence. I'll explain.

[Crawlway]

SPOCK [OC]: You were correct in your feel. The

Enterprise was put through a molecular transporter and reassembled

slightly out of phase. Reverse polarity should seal the incision. 

SCOTT: I have no time for theory. I just hope you're right. 

RAHDA [OC]: Twenty seconds, Mister Spock. 

SCOTT: I'm doing the best I can! Wait! It's stuck! It's stuck! Push the

button!

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Please continue, Mister Scott.

[Crawlway]

SCOTT: Don't be a fool! Push the button! It's your

last chance! Don't be sentimental, push it. I'm

going to die anyway.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Please continue.

[Crawlway]

SCOTT: It's loose! But there's no time. Push the

button! 

RAHDA [OC]: Nine seconds. 

(Scott gets his polarity reversed and puts the probe into the

antimatter stream)

[Bridge]

RAHDA: Eight seconds, seven seconds

[Crawlway]

RAHDA [OC]: Six seconds, five seconds, four

seconds, three seconds, two seconds.

[Bridge]

RAHDA: One. Mister Spock, now. Warp fourteen point

one. Warp fourteen. 

UHURA: Magnetic forces steady. 

(We hear the engines slowing down.) 

RAHDA: Warp thirteen point nine and dropping. 

SPOCK: Mister Scott, you have accomplished your task.

[Crawlway]

SCOTT: You might at least say thank you.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: For what purpose, Mister Scott?

[Crawlway]

SPOCK [OC]: What is it in you humans 

SCOTT: Never mind. 

SPOCK [OC]: That requires an overwhelming display of emotion in a

situation such as this? Two men pursue the only reasonable course of

action indicated, and yet you

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Feel that something else is necessary.

[Room]

(Kirk, McCoy and Sulu enter a purple room with a

cube hanging from the ceiling. It is glowing purple. Losira is there.

Did I mention she is wearing purple?) 

KIRK: Who have you come for? Form a circle. You see? You'd better tell

us. Tell us. Who have you come for?

Who have you come for? You're a very determined woman. For me? 

LOSIRA: I am for James T. Kirk. 

KIRK: Gentlemen, I need your help. 

LOSIRA: Please. I must touch you. I beg it. It is my existence. 

KIRK: We've seen the results of your touch. 

LOSIRA: But you are my match, James Kirk. I must touch you. Then I will

live as one, even to the structure of your cells,

the arrangement of chromosomes. 

KIRK: That is how you kill. You'll never reach me. 

(A second Losira appears) 

MCCOY: Watch out! 

LOSIRA 2: I am for McCoy. 

KIRK: That computer must be programming these replicas. 

MCCOY: The women match our chromosome patterns after they touch us. 

(A third Losira enters) 

SULU: It's a very painful affair. I can tell you. 

LOSIRA 3: I am for Sulu. 

KIRK: Shift positions. 

SULU: Captain, we can no longer protect each other. 

(Spock and a security guard beam in.) 

KIRK: Spock, the computer! Destroy it! 

(The guard phasers the cube, and the three Losiras disappear.) 

KIRK: Mister Spock, I certainly am glad to see you. I thought you and

the Enterprise had been destroyed. 

SPOCK: I had the same misgivings about you. We returned and picked up

your life form readings only a moment ago. 

KIRK: Returned from where? 

SPOCK: From where this brain had the power to send the Enterprise. Nine

hundred and ninety point seven light years across the galaxy. What a

remarkable culture this is. 

KIRK: Was, Mister Spock. Its defences were run by computer. 

SPOCK: I surmised that, Captain. Its moves were immensely logical. But

what people created this? Are there any representatives here? 

KIRK: There were replicas of one of them. But that power to recreate

them has been destroyed. 

SPOCK: That is a loss, Captain. 

KIRK: Well, you wouldn't have thought so, Mister Spock, if you'd been

among us. 

(An image appears on a wall) 

LOSIRA [on screen]: My fellow Kalandans, welcome. A disease has

destroyed us. Beware of it. After your long journey, I'm sorry to give

you only a recorded welcome, but we who have guarded the outpost for

you will be dead by the time you take possession of this planet. I am

the last of our advanced force left alive. Too late the physicians

discovered the cause of this sickness that kills us. In creating this

planet, we have accidentally produced a deadly organism. I have awaited

the regular supply ship from home for medical assistance, but I doubt

now whether it will arrive in time. I will set the outpost controls on

automatic. The computer will selectively defend against all life forms

but our own. My fellow Kalandans,

I, Losira, wish you well. 

MCCOY: The previous ships probably spread the disease all through their

people. The supply ship that she was waiting for never came. All these

thousands of years, she's been waiting to greet people who were dead. 

SPOCK: To do the job of defence, the computer projected a replica of

the only image available. Losira's. 

KIRK: The computer was too perfect. It projected so much of Losira's

personality into the replica that it felt regret, guilt, at killing.

That bought us the time we needed to destroy it. She must have been a

remarkable woman. 

MCCOY: And beautiful. 

SPOCK: Beauty is transitory, Doctor. However, she was evidently highly

intelligent. 

KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Five to beam up. I don't agree with you,

Mister Spock. 

SPOCK: Indeed, Captain? 

KIRK: Beauty survives.

Stardate:

5725.3

Original Airdate: 31 Jan, 1969

 

Captain's log, stardate 5725.3. The Enterprise is en route to Memory

Alpha. It is a planetoid set up by the Federation solely as a central

library containing the total cultural history and scientific knowledge

of all planetary Federation members. With us is specialist Lieutenant

Mira Romaine. She is on board to supervise the transfer of newly

designed equipment directly from the Enterprise to Memory Alpha.

[Engineering]

SCOTT: You're the sanest, the smartest, the nicest

woman that has ever come aboard this ship. 

MIRA: Anything else? 

SCOTT: Anything else, I'll keep to myself for the moment. 

KIRK [OC]: When a man of Scotty's years falls in love, the loneliness

of his life is suddenly revealed to him. His whole heart once throbbed

only to the ship's engines. He could talk only to the ship. Now he can

see nothing but the woman.

[Bridge]

CHEKOV: I didn't think Mister Scott would go for

the brainy type. 

SULU: I don't think he's even noticed she has a brain. 

KIRK: Mister Scott. Mister Scott? 

SCOTT: (turning from Mira) Hmm? 

KIRK: As soon as we're within viewing range of Memory Alpha, you and

Lieutenant Romaine will go to the emergency manual monitor. Youâll

prepare for direct transfer of equipment. 

SCOTT: Aye, Captain. 

MIRA: We're ready, sir. 

KIRK: Lieutenant, may I offer my congratulations on what will be your

first assignment for the Federation? 

KIRK: Yes. Good luck, Lieutenant. 

MIRA: Thank you. 

SULU: Captain, I'm picking up a high intensity reading. 

KIRK: Is that Memory Alpha? 

SULU: No, sir. 

(There's a bright thing in the middle of the viewscreen.) An engineer

touches Scott's arm to attract his attention.) 

SCOTT: Excuse me. 

KIRK: Magnification eight. What is that? 

SPOCK: Indications are a storm, Captain, although I've never seen one

of such great intensity or strange confirmation. 

KIRK: Readings? 

SPOCK: All sensor readings are at maximum calibration. 

SULU: Captain, it's approaching at warp factor two point six and

accelerating. 

KIRK: Check that. No natural phenomena can move faster than the speed

of light. 

SPOCK: It is definitely doing so, Captain. Therefore it cannot be a

phenomenon of nature. 

KIRK: Deflectors on. Condition yellow. 

UHURA: Condition yellow, sir. 

SULU: Shields activated, Captain. 

(The bright thing 'invades' the ship with sparkles. Only Mira does not

shield her eyes from it. Then the sparkles withdraw.) 

KIRK: Mister Sulu, get us the devil out of here! Full scan on the

disturbance that penetrated the Bridge. Lieutenant, all decks, damage

report. 

(Mira gently falls to the floor.) 

SCOTT: Mira! 

KIRK: Doctor McCoy to the Bridge. Emergency. Emergency. 

SCOTT: Mira! Mira! (her eyes and mouth are open) What's that you're

saying'? 

(McCoy enters) 

MCCOY: Was she hurt by the fall or the action of the disturbance? 

KIRK: I don't know. Did you notice, Scotty? 

SCOTT: Well, after the disturbance was over, she just collapsed. How's

she doing, Doctor? 

MCCOY: Well, I think she's coming around now. 

SCOTT: Easy, now. Easy. You had quite a fall. 

MIRA: I'm, I'm fine. 

MCCOY: You let me be the judge of that. Do you feel like walking to

Sickbay? 

MIRA: I'm fine, Doctor. Really, I am. Is everybody else all right? 

SCOTT: Aye, they are. Now you just do what Doctor McCoy ordered. 

MIRA: Why? I feel 

KIRK: Get to Sickbay, Lieutenant. That's an order. 

MIRA: Yes, sir. 

SCOTT: Captain, would it be all right if I went along to Sickbay? 

KIRK: No, Mister Scott. Stay at your post for the moment. 

SCOTT: But Captain 

KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura. Damage report. 

UHURA: Yes, sir. All stations are operative, sir. 

KIRK: Mister Spock? 

SPOCK: Some equipment was temporarily out of order. My sensors were

inoperative. 

KIRK: Any damage to the warp engines? 

SPOCK: None, Captain. 

KIRK: Good. From the action of that storm, we'll need all the speed we

can get. 

SPOCK: Captain, it was not a storm. 

UHURA: Captain. During the disturbance, Memory Alpha was hailing. I

wanted to respond, but I couldn't make my hand move. 

CHEKOV: Captain. It was not hands that were paralysed. It was eyes. I

could not force my eyes to look down and set a new course. 

SULU: No, it was speech that was affected. I couldn't utter a sound. 

KIRK: Mister Spock, explanation. 

SPOCK: Only of the result, not of the cause. In each case, a different

area of the brain was affected. Our voluntary nerve functions were

under some form of pressure. 

KIRK: Or attack. 

SPOCK: Attack might be a more precise formulation, Captain. 

KIRK: And Lieutenant Romaine seems most susceptible.

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: Are the readings corresponding, Nurse? 

CHAPEL: Everything appears normal, Doctor. 

MCCOY: Thank you. 

(Scott enters) 

MIRA: What's that you're doing, Nurse? 

CHAPEL: Recording your responses in this computer. 

MIRA: But why? I haven't had a single response worth noting. 

CHAPEL: Lieutenant, please. 

MIRA: Well, have l? 

MCCOY: Lieutenant, there are four hundred and thirty people aboard this

ship. You're the only one that passed out, and I want to know why. 

MIRA: I want to know why too. You're the doctor, you tell me. This is a

new experience for me. 

MCCOY: This whole thing is a new experience for all of us. 

MIRA: All of you are accustomed to new experiences. It's part of your

work. I'm not. 

SCOTT: She might have something there, Doctor McCoy. This is her first

deep space trip, and you know that affects people. 

MCCOY: Well, if we can get on with this, Scotty, we might make that

determination. Now then, tell me. What did you feel before you passed

out? 

MIRA: Nothing. 

MCCOY: Nothing? 

MIRA: Absolutely nothing. 

MCCOY: Lieutenant 

MIRA: Doctor, there is nothing more I can tell you. 

MCCOY: Lieutenant, you're being completely unco-operative! 

MIRA: Are you putting that into my record? It's not true. 

MCCOY: I'll put the facts into your record, if I can get them. 

SCOTT: Come on now, Mira. We must help the doctor. Tell us what

happened. 

MCCOY: Perhaps you can explain to her that any career she hopes for in

Starfleet requires discipline and co-operation. 

SCOTT: I'm sure that's what the lieutenant wants. She just didn't

understand. Did you now, lass? 

(McCoy leaves) 

CHAPEL: With a bedside manner like that, Scotty, you're in the wrong

business. 

(Chapel leaves) 

MIRA: When the record of this is forwarded, I'll be sent back, won't I.



SCOTT: Oh, you will not! That's ridiculous. This getting used to space

travel, that takes some doing. And not everybody takes to it. 

MIRA: Did you? 

SCOTT: Well, me, that's different. I was practically born to it. 

MIRA: I want to continue. 

SCOTT: You will. You passed your Starfleet preliminary examinations.

And this is just getting used to what you might call your space legs. 

MIRA: I hope that's all it is.

[Bridge]

SULU: Captain, I've plotted the storm's path. 

KIRK: Main screen projection. 

SULU: On its present course, it will hit Memory Alpha planetoid as it

did us. 

KIRK: Lieutenant, try and warn Memory Alpha of the proximity of that

phenomena. Give me an ETA for its possible impact. 

CHEKOV: I cannot, sir. It has the ability to change speed. 

UHURA: Sir, I'm unable to establish contact with the planetoid. I'm

hailing on all frequencies. No response. 

SPOCK: It is of little consequence, Captain. Memory Alpha has no

protective shields. 

KIRK: No shields? 

SPOCK: None, Captain. When the library complex was assembled, shielding

was considered inappropriate to its totally academic purpose. Since the

information on the Memory planet is available to everyone, special

protection was deemed unnecessary. 

KIRK: Wonderful. I hope the storm is aware of that rationale. 

CHEKOV: Completing approach to planetoid. 

SULU: It is already over Memory Alpha, Captain! Its speed is

incredible. It's hitting the planetoid. 

KIRK: Are we within orbit range, Mister Chekov? 

CHEKOV: Making final approach. 

KIRK: Lieutenant, try and warn them of 

UHURA: I'm sorry, sir. I can't break through this interference. 

KIRK: Mister Spock, how many people are on Memory Alpha? 

SPOCK: It varies with the number of scholars, researchers, and

scientists from the various Federation planets who are using the

computer complex. 

CHEKOV: Captain, we are within orbit range. 

KIRK: Lock into orbit. 

CHEKOV: Aye, sir. 

SULU: It is leaving Memory Alpha, Captain. 

SPOCK: Sensors give no readings of generated energy from Memory Alpha,

Captain. 

KIRK: Any life readings? 

SPOCK: None. 

KIRK: Let's find out what's going on down there. Kirk to Engineering.

Mister Scott, report. Kirk to Engineering. Mister Scott. Where the

devil is he? Scotty, report to the Bridge. Report to the Bridge. Have

the transporter room stand by. I'm taking a landing party down. 

UHURA: Aye, aye, sir. 

SCOTT [OC]: Scott here. 

KIRK: Scotty, where've you been? Where are you? 

SCOTT: In the Sickbay. 

KIRK: Are you sick?

[Sickbay]

SCOTT: Och, no. I was just checking on the lass.

She's going to be fine now. There's nothing wrong with her.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Well, I'm relieved to hear your prognosis,

Mister Scott. Is the doctor there with you, or will I find him in

Engineering?

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: McCoy here, Jim. 

KIRK [OC]: Doctor, how's the girl? 

MCCOY: I think she's in good shape. 

KIRK [OC]: Well, Mister Scott seems to agree with you. The two of you

meet me in the transporter room on the double. 

(McCoy and Scott leave, then we see in Mira's eye the sparkles and an

image of a dead alien presumably on Memory Alpha)

Captain's log, supplemental, stardate 5725.6. The

storm has cleared Memory Alpha. It is heading away at incredible speed.

We have been unable to make contact with the planetoid. Its silence is

ominous. We are beaming down to investigate.

[Memory Alpha]

MCCOY: Somehow, I find transporting into the

darkness unnerving. 

KIRK: Scotty, can you get us some more light? 

SCOTT: I'm afraid this light'll have to do, Captain. The generator is

inoperative. 

KIRK: Damage report, Spock. 

SPOCK: A disaster for the galaxy, Captain. The central brain is

damaged. The memory core is burned out. The loss to the galaxy may be

irretrievable. 

SCOTT: Captain! 

(They go into the next area and find the body we saw in Mira's eye,

along with others.) 

SPOCK: A very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity, Captain. 

KIRK: Locate him and keep him alive. We need more information about

this enemy. 

(McCoy finds her on the floor around a corner) 

MCCOY: Over here, Captain! 

KIRK: Bones, can you do something? 

MCCOY: Not a thing, Jim. (the woman's mouth is moving) The same garbled

sounds Lieutenant Romaine made when she fainted after the storm. 

KIRK: Are you sure? 

MCCOY: Absolutely sure. 

KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. 

SULU [OC]: Sulu here. 

KIRK: Beam down Lieutenant Romaine immediately. 

SULU [OC]: Yes, sir. 

(The woman's face turns different vivid colours.) 

KIRK: Spock, have you seen anything like that before? 

SPOCK: Negative. 

KIRK: Bones? 

MCCOY: She's dead. 

KIRK: What did she die of? 

MCCOY: Severe brain haemorrhaging due to distortion of all neural

systems, dissolution of autonomic nervous system. All basic personality

factors, Captain. 

SPOCK: The attack was thorough. 

KIRK: What did the others die of? 

MCCOY: Each had a different centre of brain destroyed, cause unknown. 

KIRK: A different centre of the brain, you say? 

MCCOY: Yes, Captain. I can be more detailed when we return to the ship

and use the ship's computers. 

(Mira beams in) 

SCOTT: Mira! The captain has some questions.

MIRA: Yes, Captain. 

KIRK: Lieutenant, when you were unconscious, you were speaking. 

MIRA: What did I say? 

KIRK: I don't know. The words were unfamiliar to me. 

MIRA: What did it sound like? 

KIRK: They sounded exactly like the last words spoken by the

technician. 

MIRA: What technician? 

MCCOY: We found one person in there just barely alive. The rest were

dead, and we 

(Mira runs to see) 

KIRK: Lieutenant. Lieutenant. 

MIRA: We must get back to the ship! 

KIRK: Why? Tell me why. 

MIRA: That storm, it's returning. 

KIRK: How do you know? 

MIRA: I know. You'll be killed if we stay. 

SPOCK: Lieutenant, I assure you that unexplained phenomenon was headed

away from the planet. It is probably seeking other victims. 

MIRA: I tell you t will kill us.

[Bridge]

SULU: Enterprise to Captain Kirk.

[Memory Alpha]

KIRK: Kirk here. 

SULU [OC]: Bridge, sir. The storm has reappeared on the long range

scanner and is closing fast. 

KIRK: What's its course? 

SULU [OC]: Coming back in this direction. 

KIRK: Beam us up.

[Transporter room]

(The four men materialise on the pads.) 

KIRK: Mister Sulu, this is the captain. Get the Enterprise out of here.



SCOTT: Wait, Captain. We've lost Mira. 

KIRK: Delay that order, Mister Sulu! 

SCOTT: Stabilise her! 

KYLE: Something's interfering with the transporter signal. I have her

co-ordinates, but she's suspended in transit. 

SCOTT: Let me. 

(Finally Mira arrives, feeling dizzy) 

KIRK: All right, Mister Sulu, get us out of here. Mister Scott, check

emergency manual monitor for transporter control.

[Bridge]

SULU: Captain, it's changing course. 

KIRK: Plot the new course, Mister Chekov. 

CHEKOV: Present course is one two six mark twenty. 

KIRK: Plot it. 

Present course will bring it across our starboard side, sir. 

KIRK: Mister Spock, you made a statement that phenomenon is not a

storm. Explain. 

SPOCK: No known conditions in space would support that type of natural

phenomenon. 

KIRK: What is it? 

SPOCK: I'm having difficulty with the ship's sensors. They seem to be

under selective attack by the phenomenon as the unfortunate occupants

of Memory Alpha were. 

KIRK: Then deductive reasoning will have to be substituted. 

SPOCK: Ship's sensors are operating at the moment. Perhaps the elusive

creature will now reveal something about itself.

[Engineering]

MIRA: I saw those men dead, in their exact

positions! 

SCOTT: Listen to me. I've told you what strange tricks a space trip can

play on your mind. Now, that's all it is. 

MIRA: No, Scotty. 

SCOTT: Have you ever had visions of the future events before this? 

MIRA: Never. 

SCOTT: Well, if you ask me, nobody ever has. That seeing to the future,

it's pure bunk. You know that, don't you?Â 

MIRA: I've always believed it. 

SCOTT: And you were perfectly right. 

MIRA: Then what is it, Scotty? What's frightening me? Ever since that

storm hit, I've, I've had such strange thoughts, such feelings of

terror. 

SCOTT: Space. Space, that's all it is. 

MIRA: Then I don't have to report it? 

SCOTT: Well, if you want to spend the rest of the trip in Sickbay. But

what good would that do? Doctor McCoy can no more cure it than he can a

cold.

[Bridge]

SULU: Captain, it's heading straight for us. 

KIRK: Activate shields. 

SULU: Shields activated. 

KIRK: Mister Chekov, change course to one four three mark three. 

CHEKOV: One four three mark three. 

KIRK: Storm's course, Mister Sulu? 

SULU: One four three mark three. 

KIRK: Take evasive action. 

SULU: Evasive action. 

KIRK: Hard starboard, two one seven mark five. 

SULU: Two one seven mark five. Still with us, sir. 

KIRK: Hard port, one one seven mark two. 

SULU: One one seven mark two. Still with us, sir! 

KIRK: Is it closing? 

SPOCK: Negative, Captain. Maintaining its distance. However, it is

matching each manoeuvre we execute, and I am receiving increasing

magnitude of energy. 

KIRK: Your analysis, Spock. What is it? 

SPOCK: Not what is it, Captain. What are they? There are ten distinct

life units within it, all powerfully alive and vital. 

KIRK: Who are they? Where are they from? 

SPOCK: Impossible to determine without programming for computer

analysis. 

KIRK: It's clear we can't outrun them. Can we shield against them? 

SPOCK: I do not believe the Enterprise shields would prove an effective

defence. 

KIRK: There must be some defence we can use. 

SPOCK: Captain, we are dealing with a community of life units. Their

attack is in the form of brain waves directed against the brain, which

is most compatible. 

KIRK: Maybe we can avoid another attack. Lieutenant Uhura, open all

channels. Tie in the universal translator. Mister Spock says it's

alive. Maybe I can talk to it. 

UHURA: All channels open. Translator tied in. 

KIRK: This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We wish you no

harm. Physical contact between us is fatal to our life forms. Please,

do not come any closer to our ship. 

SPOCK: Perhaps it did not understand. 

SULU: Captain, change in velocity recorded. They are passing our

starboard side and

manoeuvreing in front of us. Switching to forward scanner. Captain,

change in velocity recorded. It has accelerated its approach.

[Engineering]

MIRA: Help, Scotty! 

SCOTT: What? 

MIRA: Hold me. It's happening again. No! 

SCOTT: Mira.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Perhaps it understands another kind of

language. Condition Red Alert. Prepare for phaser firing.

[Engineering]

SCOTT: Mira. 

MIRA: No, Scotty. No! No. 

(Scott holds her close.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Lock in phaser tracking controls. 

Locked in, sir. 

KIRK: Adjust phasers to fire across its course. Do not hit it. 

SULU: Locked in, sir. 

KIRK: Fire. Reaction, Mister Sulu? 

SULU: None, sir. They're still approaching us. 

KIRK: Apparently a shot across the bow is insufficiently convincing.

Prepare to lock phasers into the heart of the community. 

SULU: Locked in, sir. 

KIRK: Fire.

[Engineering]

(Mira falls to the floor, clutching her stomach in

pain) 

MIRA: Scotty! 

SCOTT: Mira! Mira.

[Bridge]

SULU: The phasers seem to have stopped their

approach. They're holding position. 

KIRK: Lock in for another blast. 

SULU: Locked in, sir. 

SCOTT [OC]: Captain! Captain, the phaser shots, they're killing Mira! 

KIRK: Killing Lieutenant Romaine?

[Engineering]

SCOTT: Aye. When you fired the phasers, they

stunned her and she crumpled.

[Bridge]

SCOTT [OC]: Another shot and you'll kill her! 

KIRK: Get her to Sickbay at once. 

SULU: Ready for firing, Captain. 

KIRK: Cancel that order. Another attack on that alien life form will

kill Lieutenant Romaine. 

SPOCK: It appears so. 

KIRK: If she is to survive, we can't attack. 

SPOCK: Not directly. 

KIRK: Can the computer supply a defence based on the data you've been

accumulating? 

SPOCK: Negative, Captain. I have not been able to gather sufficient

data for that. Captain, there is only one possible defence. If we can

find an environment which is deadly to the alien form. 

KIRK: And yet isolate the girl from its deadly effects. Captain Kirk to

Doctor McCoy. 

MCCOY [OC]: Yes, Captain. 

KIRK: Is the girl well enough to be questioned? 

MCCOY [OC]: I can have her ready in a few minutes. 

KIRK: Have the Lieutenant and Mister Scott in the briefing room as

quickly as possible. Bring all available biographical material with

you. Kirk out. Mister Spock, come with me.

[Briefing room]

MCCOY: Go easy on her, Jim. She's in a pretty bad

state. 

KIRK: I'll try. 

(Scott and Mira enter) 

KIRK: Lieutenant Romaine. 

MIRA: I didn't mean to be unco-operative, Doctor. 

MCCOY: Of course you didn't. I told the Captain. 

KIRK: We must get to understand what is happening. 

MIRA: I'll tell you everything I know. 

KIRK: Ship's investigative procedures are sometimes confusing to a new

crewman. Don't let us upset you. 

MIRA: I trust all of you implicitly. I want to help. 

KIRK: This investigation has been prompted by two events. First is the

time you passed out on the Bridge, and the second is when we fired our

main phasers into that force that is attacking us and seriously injured

you. 

MIRA: You mustn't worry about hurting me. 

KIRK: Now this is how we'll proceed. Mister Spock has all the

information available to us about our attackers. Doctor McCoy has

access to Starfleet's exhaustive files on you. A comparison of the two

may turn up some improbable connection which may protect you and

ourselves. All right, gentlemen? Doctor McCoy, will you proceed? 

MCCOY: Romaine, Mira. Lieutenant. Place of birth, Martian Colony Number

Three. Parents, Lydia Romaine, deceased. Jacques Romaine, chief

engineer, Starfleet, retired. 

KIRK: Mister Spock, are you prepared with the background history of the

attackers? 

SPOCK: I am, Captain. I have fed all obtainable data to the main

computer. It should be ready to supply whatever conclusions are

possible. 

KIRK: Thank you. Mister Sulu, what is the status of our friends? 

SULU [on monitor]: Status unchanged. They're still with us and keeping

the same distance. 

KIRK: Continue evasive manoeuvres. Keep me informed. Kirk out. Doctor,

do you have a medical record of Lieutenant Romaine available? 

MCCOY: Yes, Captain. 

KIRK: I'd like a few items from her psychological profile checked. Any

history of psychosomatic illness? 

MCCOY: Occasional and teenage routine incidents. 

KIRK: Any evidence of involuntary or unconscious telepathic abilities? 

MCCOY: None. 

KIRK: Any pathological or unusual empathic responses? 

MCCOY: No, Captain, not empathic. However, an extremely flexible and

pliant response to new learning situations is highly marked. 

KIRK: Go ahead, Doctor. 

MCCOY: After our phasers hit that thing, I gave Lieutenant Romaine a

standard Steinman analysis. The results might be interesting. 

KIRK: Go ahead. 

MCCOY: The comparison of our Steinman with Starfleet records shows that

Lieutenant Romaine's fingerprints, voice analysis, all external factors

remain exactly the same as before. However, according to two

hyperencephalograms, her brain wave pattern has been altered. 

KIRK: That's impossible! 

MCCOY: That's what I was taught. But the BCP is just as consistent as

fingerprints. 

KIRK: Let's see it. 

(A jagged graph comes up on the monitor. Spock raises an eyebrow) 

SPOCK: Doctor McCoy, according to your records, Lieutenant Romaine

showed no abnormal telepathic powers. 

MCCOY: That's right, Spock. But exceptional pliancy was indicated. That

might be a factor. 

SPOCK: And you are sure that this is the correct slide? 

MCCOY: Yes, Mister Spock. That is tape deck D, brain circuitry pattern

of Lieutenant Mira Romaine. 

SPOCK: Gentlemen, it also happens to be tape H, the impulse tracking

obtained from the alien life units. 

MCCOY: Nurse Chapel followed this every step of the way. There can be

no error. 

KIRK: Check it, Spock. 

(Spock puts his computer disc in, and the two patterns overlap and

match exactly.) 

SPOCK: As I said, Captain, this is the tracking obtained during the

last shielded run. Computer, run a detailed comparison brain circuitry

patterns, tape D and tape H. 

COMPUTER: Comparison tape D's brain circuitry patterns of Lieutenant

Mira Romaine and tape H, brain circuitry patterns

of alien life unit, identical. Identical. 

SPOCK: Fascinating. 

MCCOY: There has been no error. 

SPOCK: Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. There is an identity of minds

taking place

between the alien beings and the mind of Lieutenant Romaine. Their

thoughts are becoming hers.

[Bridge]

SULU: Bridge to Captain Kirk.

[Briefing room]

SULU [OC]: The alien is no longer maintaining its

distance. 

KIRK: Continue evasive action. Keep me informed. Kirk out. 

SCOTT: Mira has tried to tell me all along that she was seeing things

in advance. 

KIRK: Why didn't you report it? 

SCOTT: You don't report space sickness. That's all I thought it was. 

KIRK: What did she see? 

SCOTT: The first attack on the ship, the attack on Memory Alpha and the

time we nearly lost her. 

KIRK: Those were all acts carried out by our attacker. 

SCOTT: And? And? 

KIRK: Yes, Scotty? What else? 

SCOTT: I thought for a moment there was something else, but I guess I

was wrong. 

KIRK: Was he wrong, Lieutenant? 

MIRA: Yes, there was one other time. 

KIRK: What did you see? 

MIRA: I saw Scotty. 

KIRK: Where? 

MIRA: I don't know. 

KIRK: What was he doing? 

MIRA: He was dying. Now I understand what's been happening. I've been

seeing through another mind. I've been flooded with thoughts not my own

that control me. Oh, Scotty, Scotty! I'd rather die than hurt you. I'd

rather die. 

SCOTT@ All right, now. What's all this talk of dying? They've called

the turn on us three out of four times. Now, that's a better average

than anybody deserves. It's our turn now. We'll fight them. So let's

not hear anything more about dying. 

KIRK: Kirk here. 

SULU [OC]: Sulu, Captain. All evasion tactics carried out as ordered. 

KIRK: What success did you have? 

SULU [OC]: Itâs been useless, Captain. 

SPOCK: At their present force, they will get through the shields this

time, Captain. 

KIRK: Warp eight, Mister Sulu. 

SULU [OC]: Yes, sir. 

KIRK: They'll be here very soon. They may destroy you and us as they

did Memory Alpha. You are especially susceptible to their will. But we

have one chance to survive. Don't resist. Let them begin to function

through you. If we can control that moment, we have a chance. Will you

try? 

MIRA: Tell me what to do. 

KIRK: Captain Kirk to medical lab. 

CREWMAN [OC]: Medical lab here, sir. 

KIRK: Prepare the antigrav test units. Let's go.

[Bridge]

SULU: Attention. All personnel, attention. Alien

force has penetrated the ship.

[Corridor]

SULU [OC]: Take defensive action. Attention, all

personnel. The alien being has penetrated the ship. Take defensive

action. 

SECURITY [OC]: General quarters. Security condition three. Intruder

alert. Repeat. General quarters. Security condition three. Intruder

alert.

[Medical lab]

KIRK: As soon as she has entered the gravity

chamber, secure all ports. 

(The pretty lights enter the room) 

MIRA: Don't touch me, Scotty! Stay away. 

(Then enter Mira. She changes colour and makes the strange noise) 

SCOTT: We've lost her to them. 

KIRK: Stay where you are. 

MCCOY: She could kill us all in this state. 

SPOCK: She will, unless we are able to complete what the captain has

planned. 

SCOTT: Stay with us, Mira. Please stay. 

MIRA: I'm trying. I want to be with you. They are too strong. 

KIRK: Don't lose yourself to them. Hold on. 

MIRA: I am Mira Romaine. I will be who I choose to be. I will. Stay

away, Scotty! They are with me. They will kill you. 

SCOTT: You won't let them. 

ZETAR: (through Mira) She cannot stop us. You cannot prevent it. 

SCOTT: Mira. Mira! Captain. 

KIRK: That's not Mira talking. 

SPOCK: Captain, we must deal with them directly, now, while she still

retains partial identity. We can speak to them. They will answer using

her voice. 

KIRK: I'm Captain James Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise. Do you

understand? 

ZETAR: Yes, we understand you. We have searched for a millennium for

one through whom we can see and speak and hear and live out our lives. 

KIRK: Who are you? 

ZETAR: We are from Zetar. 

SPOCK: That is one of the planets where all humanoid life was

destroyed. 

KIRK: You can't be from Zetar. All life was destroyed there long ago. 

ZETAR: Yes, all corporeal life was destroyed. 

KIRK: Then what are you? 

ZETAR: The desires, the hopes, the mind and the will of the last

hundred of Zetar. The force of our life could not be wiped out. 

KIRK: All things die. 

ZETAR: At the proper time. Our planet was dying. We were determined to

live on. At the peak of our plans to go, a sudden final disaster struck

us down. But the force of our lives survived. At last we have found

someone through whom we can live it out. 

KIRK: The body of the one you inhabit has its own life to lead. 

ZETAR: She will accept ours. 

KIRK: She will not. She is fighting for her own identity. 

ZETAR: Her mind will accept our thoughts. Our lives will be fulfilled. 

KIRK: Will she learn the way people on Memory Alpha learned? 

ZETAR: We did not wish to kill. 

KIRK: But you did kill! 

ZETAR: No. Resisting us killed those people. We did not kill them. 

KIRK: The price of your survival is too high. 

ZETAR: We only want the girl. 

KIRK: You can't have her. You're entitled to your own life, but not

another's. 

MIRA: Life was given to me. It is mine. I want to live it out. I will 

MCCOY: The girlâs life reading is becoming a match to the Zetarians.

She's losing. 

ZETAR: Do not fight us. 

SPOCK: They will not accept their own deaths. 

KIRK: They'll be forced to accept it. 

ZETAR: You will all die. 

SPOCK: Captain, if we cannot complete the plan, they will carry out

their threat. 

KIRK: We must get her into the pressure chamber. 

MCCOY: Jim, you realize the pressure needed to kill the Zetars might

kill the girl too. 

SCOTT: Mira will not kill me. 

(Scott picks her up and gets her into the chamber before being thrown

across the room) 

SCOTT: I told you she wouldn't kill me. 

KIRK: Secure the chamber. Neutralise gravity. 

MCCOY: The Zetars are growing stronger. 

SPOCK: The weightless state has become their natural condition. 

KIRK: Pressurise the unit. Bring pressure to two atmospheres and then

increase one atmosphere per second. Continue increasing pressure.

Pressure, Spock. Pressure. 

MCCOY: The pressure is dangerously high, Captain. It may damage her. 

KIRK: Continue, Spock. 

(The lights leave Mira) 

KIRK: Pressure! 

(The lights fizzle away) 

MCCOY: We've done it, Jim. They're gone. 

SCOTT: (intercom) It's all right, Mira. They're gone. They're gone! 

(She looks at him and smiles) 

MCCOY: Reduce the pressure very, very gradually, Spock. 

SPOCK: We may tax Mister Scott's patience, Doctor. 

MCCOY: Lie perfectly still, Lieutenant. Try not to move at all. Take

deep, regular breaths. Now, don't hold it. Continue to breathe deeply.

In, out. In, out. That's it. Now, you'll be in there another twenty

minutes, so why don't you just try to relax? 

SCOTT: Now we have all the time in the world.

[McCoy's office]

KIRK: Bones, are you able to judge the long range

effects on Lieutenant Romaine? 

MCCOY: When the personality of a human is involved, exact predictions

are hazardous. 

SPOCK: Particularly where humans are involved, Doctor. 

MCCOY: However, despite Starfleet judgment of the pliancy of the

Lieutenant, she put up a valiant struggle to retain her identity, and I

find that encouraging. 

SPOCK: Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. While the truth was difficult

to accept, when it was revealed, the girl reacted well. I would say her

struggle in this experience would strengthen her entire ego structure. 

KIRK: Would either of you credit Scotty's steadfast belief in her as a

factor? 

SPOCK: You mean, love as motivation? Humans do claim a great deal for

that particular emotion. I suppose it is possible. However 

MCCOY: There are no howevers about it, Mister Spock. It was a factor,

and it will be a factor in the girl's recovery. 

KIRK: Do I take it both of you agree that Lieutenant Romaine need not

return to Starbase for further treatment? 

MCCOY: Well, I should think work would be a better therapy. 

SPOCK: Logical. 

KIRK: Captain Kirk to Mister Scott. 

SCOTT [OC]: Scott here, sir. 

KIRK: Mister Scott, how's Lieutenant Romaine? 

SCOTT [OC]: Beautiful, Captain. 

KIRK: Yes, Mister Scott. Do I take it you say that she is fit for duty?



SCOTT [OC]: Positively, Captain. 

KIRK: Thank you. Kirk to Bridge. 

SULU [OC]: Sulu, Captain. 

KIRK: Mister Sulu, set course for Memory Alpha. Lieutenant Romaine has

a lot of work to do there. 

SULU [OC]: Yes, sir. 

KIRK: Well, this is an Enterprise first. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and

Engineer Scott find themselves in complete agreement. Can I stand the

strain?

The Star Trek Transcripts - Requiem For Methuselah

Requiem

For Methuselah

Stardate:

5843.7

Original Airdate: 14 Feb, 1969

 

Captain's log, stardate 5843.7. The Enterprise is in the grip of a

raging epidemic. Three crewmen have died and twenty three others have

been struck down by Rigelian fever. In order to combat the illness,

Doctor McCoy needs large quantities of ryetalyn,

which is the only known antidote for the fever. Our sensors have picked

up sufficient quantities of pure ryetalyn on a small planet in the

Omega system. We are beaming down to secure this urgently needed

material.

[Planet surface]

(Compared to the lurid red, purple and vivid blue

of the planet from space, the ground is pretty normal) 

KIRK: Report. 

MCCOY: Jim, there's a large deposit bearing two seven three, four

kilometres away. I've got four hours to process that stuff, otherwise

the epidemic will be irreversible. Everybody on board the Enterprise

will 

SPOCK: Strange. Readings indicate a life form in the vicinity,

apparently human. Yet ship's sensors indicated this planet was

uninhabited. 

KIRK: Let's get that ryetalyn. 

(A strange device comes travelling through the air towards them. A bit

like Nomad, but much smaller and with more round bits. It fires an

energy beam at the landing party's feet. They try to fire their

phasers.) 

KIRK: Inoperative. 

(The device fires again, and closes in.) 

FLINT: Do not kill. 

(The device backs away and a silver-haired man in sort of doublet and

hose approaches) 

KIRK: I'm Captain James Kirk 

FLINT: I know who you are. I have monitored your ship since it entered

this system. 

KIRK: Then if you know who we are, you know why we're here, Mister? 

FLINT: Flint. You will leave my planet. 

SPOCK: Did you say your planet, sir? 

FLINT: My retreat from the unpleasantness of life on Earth, and the

company of people. 

KIRK: Mister Flint, I have a sick crew up there. We can't possibly

reach another planet in time. You can't refuse us the ryetalyn. 

FLINT: You're trespassing, Captain. 

KIRK: We're in need! We'll pay for it, work for it, trade for it. 

FLINT: You have nothing I want. 

KIRK: But you have the ryetalyn that we need! If necessary, we'll take

it. 

FLINT: If you do not leave voluntarily, I have the power to force you

to leave or kill you where you stand. 

KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, lock phasers onto our

co-ordinates. 

SCOTT [OC]: Aye, Captain, all phasers locked on. 

KIRK: Mister Flint, if anything happens to us, four deaths and then my

crew comes down and takes that ryetalyn. 

FLINT: An interesting test of power. Your enormous forces against mine.

Who would win? 

SPOCK: Mister Flint, unless you are certain, I would suggest you

refrain from a most useless experiment. 

KIRK: We need only a few hours. 

MCCOY: Have you ever seen a victim of Rigelian fever? They die in one

day. The effects are like bubonic plague. 

FLINT: Constantinople, summer 1334. It marched through the streets, the

sewers. It left the city by ox cart, by sea, to kill half of Europe.

The rats, rustling and squealing in the night as they, too, died. The

rats. 

SPOCK: Are you a student of history, sir? 

FLINT: I am. The Enterprise, a plague ship. You have two hours, at the

end of which time you will leave. 

KIRK: With all due gratitude. 

FLINT: M4 will gather the ryetalyn which you need. (the device leaves)

Permit me to offer you more comfortable surroundings.

[Living room]

(A comfortable room, with 18th century furniture,

woven rugs, paintings on the wall) 

FLINT: Come in, gentlemen. 

Our ship's sensors did not reveal your presence here, Mister Flint. 

FLINT: My planet is surrounded by screens which create the impression

of lifelessness. A protection against the curious, the uninvited. 

SPOCK: Then you live here alone. 

FLINT: Except for M4, which serves as butler, housekeeper, gardener and

guardian. 

KIRK: A most impressive home, Mister Flint. 

MCCOY: Yes, a Shakespeare first folio. A Gutenberg Bible.

[Sitting room]

(A young woman sits in a high-backed carved chair,

watching a monitor image of Kirk) 

MCCOY [OC]: The Creation lithographs by Taranullus of Centauri Seven.

That's one of the rarest book collections in the galaxy, spanning

centuries. 

FLINT [on monitor]: Be comfortable, gentlemen. Help yourselves to

brandy.

[Living room]

MCCOY: Do we trust him? 

SPOCK: It would seem logical to do so for the moment. 

MCCOY: Well, I'll need two hours to process that ryetalyn into

antitoxin. 

KIRK: If that ryetalyn isn't here in one hour, we'll go prospecting,

right over Mister Flint if necessary. 

SPOCK: This is the most splendid private collection of art I've ever

seen, and the most unique. The majority are the works of Leonardo da

Vinci, Renaissance period, some of the works of Reginald Pollack, 20th

century, and even a sten from Marcus Two.

[Sitting room]

RAYNA: At last I have seen other humans. 

FLINT: Other men. 

RAYNA: One is not human. 

FLINT: The Vulcan. 

RAYNA: Oh, so that is a Vulcan. I would like to discuss sub-dimensional

physics with him. You've taught me all you know in the area and you say

Vulcans know more. 

FLINT: Even he is not your intellectual equal, nor mine. 

RAYNA: Let me meet them. 

FLINT: They are selfish, brutal, a part of the human community which I

rejected and from which I've shielded you. 

RAYNA: Soon they will be gone. Let me meet them. 

FLINT: Rayna. (nearly kisses her) Have you been lonely? 

RAYNA: What is loneliness? 

FLINT: It is thirst. It is a flower dying in the desert. 

RAYNA: Flint, don't take this opportunity away from me. It's so

exciting. 

FLINT: Exciting? You have never made a demand of me before. 

RAYNA: I'm sorry. 

FLINT: Do not be sorry. It might be interesting.

[Living room]

MCCOY: Saurian brandy, one hundred years old. Jim? 

KIRK: Please. 

MCCOY: Mister Spock, I know you won't have one. Heaven forbid those

mathematically perfect brain waves be corrupted by this all too human

vice. 

SPOCK: Thank you, Doctor. I will have a brandy. 

MCCOY: Do you think the two of us can handle a drunk Vulcan? Once

alcohol hits that green blood 

SPOCK: If I appear distracted, it is because of what I have seen. I am

close to experiencing an unaccustomed emotion. 

MCCOY: I'll drink to that. What emotion? 

SPOCK: Envy. None of these da Vinci paintings has ever been catalogued

or reproduced. They are unknown works, all apparently authentic to the

last brush stroke and use of materials. As undiscovered da Vinciâs,

they would be priceless. 

KIRK: Would be? You mean you think they're fakes? 

SPOCK: Most strange. A man of Flint's obvious wealth and impeccable

taste scarcely needs to hang fakes. Yet my tricorder analysis indicates

that the canvas and pigments used are of contemporary origin. 

KIRK: Well, this could be what it seems to be, or it could be a cover,

a setup, or even an illusion. 

MCCOY: Well, that could explain the paintings. Similar to the real

thing. 

KIRK: Spock, at your earliest opportunity, take a full tricorder

reading of our host. See if he's human. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister

Scott? 

SCOTT [OC]: Aye, Captain. 

KIRK: Mister Scott, run a full computer check on Mister Flint and on

this planet, Holberg Nine One Seven G. Stand by with your results. I'll

contact. 

SCOTT [OC]: Aye, sir. 

KIRK: Kirk out. Let's enjoy this brandy. It tastes real. 

(M4 glides in with a bag of purple crystals and puts it on the table.

It leaves) 

KIRK: Easy. Bones? 

MCCOY: Ryetalyn, ready to be processed into antitoxin. 

KIRK: Beam up to the ship and start processing. 

FLINT: That will not be necessary, Captain. M4 can prepare the ryetalyn

for inoculation more quickly in my laboratory than you could aboard

your ship. 

MCCOY: I would like to supervise that, of course. 

FLINT: And when you are satisfied as to procedures, I hope you will do

me the honour of being my guests at dinner. 

KIRK: Thank you, Mister Flint. I don't think we have the time. 

FLINT: I regret my earlier inhospitality. Let me make amends. 

(Rayna enters, and that thud you hear is Kirk's jaw hitting the floor) 

FLINT: Gentlemen, may I present Rayna. 

KIRK: I thought you lived alone. 

FLINT: I meant there are no others besides my family. Doctor McCoy.

Mister Spock. 

RAYNA: Mister Spock, I do hope we can find a moment to discuss field

density and its relationship to gravity phenomena. 

SPOCK: Indeed. I would appreciate such a talk. It is an interest of

mine. 

FLINT: Captain Kirk. 

RAYNA: Captain Kirk. 

KIRK: Rayna. 

FLINT: Her parents were killed in an accident while in my employ.

Before dying, they placed their infant, Rayna Kapec, in my custody. I

have raised and educated her. 

MCCOY: With most impressive results, sir. What else interests you

besides gravity phenomena, Rayna? 

RAYNA: Everything. Less than that is betrayal of the intellect. 

MCCOY: The totality of the universe? All knowledge? 

FLINT: Rayna possesses the equivalent of seventeen university degrees

in the sciences and arts. She is aware that the intellect is not all.

But its cultivation must come first or the individual makes errors,

wastes time in unprofitable pursuits. 

MCCOY: At her age, I rather enjoyed errors with no noticeable damage,

but I must admit you're the farthest thing from a bookworm I've ever

seen. 

RAYNA: Flint is my teacher. You are the only other men I've ever seen. 

MCCOY: The misfortune of men everywhere, and our privilege. 

FLINT: If you would accompany my robot to the laboratory, Doctor, you

can rest assured that the ryetalyn is being processed. 

MCCOY: Thank you, sir. 

(McCoy and M4 leave) 

FLINT: Your pleasure, gentlemen. Chess, billiards, conversation? 

KIRK: Why not all three? 

(M4 leads McCoy into a lab, then disappears through a door. McCoy

examines the large coloured jars on a table whilst M4 works behind an

opaque window) 

(Rayna sends the cue ball around all four cushions to hit both reds.

Billiards) 

KIRK: Did you teach her that? 

FLINT: We play often. 

RAYNA: May I show you, Captain? 

KIRK: You said something about savagery, Mister Flint. When was the

last time you visited Earth? 

FLINT: You would tell me that it is no longer cruel. But it is,

Captain. Look at your starship, bristling with weapons.

Its mission to colonise, exploit, destroy, if necessary, to advance

Federation causes. 

(Rayna guides Kirk's shot, but he misses anyway) 

KIRK: Thank you. Our missions are peaceful, our weapons defensive. If

we were barbarians, we would not have asked for ryetalyn. Indeed, your

greeting, not ours, lacked a certain benevolence. 

FLINT: The result of pressures which are not your concern. 

KIRK: Yes, well, those pressures are everywhere in everyone, urging him

to what you call savagery. The private hells, the inner needs and

mysteries, the beast of instinct. As human beings, that is the way it

is. To be human is to be complex. You can't avoid a little ugliness

from within and from without. 

(While Rayna is very close to Kirk, Spock is at a gold carved grand

piano) 

FLINT: Why don't you play the waltz, Mister Spock? To be human is also

to seek pleasure, to laugh, to dance. Rayna is a most accomplished

dancer. 

KIRK: May I have the pleasure? 

(So the couple do an old-fashioned waltz as Spock plays) 

(In the lab, M4 brings three vials to McCoy for analysis) 

(Kirk and Rayna are now literally cheek to cheek. Flint is watching her

carefully)

(McCoy enters)

KIRK: Is something wrong? 

MCCOY: Yes, there's something wrong. The ryetalyn is no good. It

contains irillium, nearly one part per thousand. 

SPOCK: Irillium will render the antitoxin inert and useless. 

FLINT: Most unfortunate that it was not detected. I shall go with M4 to

gather more ryetalyn and screen it myself. You're welcome to join me,

Doctor. 

MCCOY: Thank you. 

(Flint leaves) 

KIRK: Time factor, Bones? Epidemic? 

MCCOY: Nearly two and a half hours. I guess we've got time to get in

under the wire. Iâve never seen anything like the speed of that robot.

It'd take us twice as long to process that stuff. 

KIRK: But would we have made the error? 

MCCOY: Jim, what if all the ryetalyn on this planet contains irillium? 

KIRK: Go with Flint. Keep an eye on procedures. 

MCCOY: Like a hawk. 

(McCoy leaves) 

SPOCK: Captain. Something else which is rather extraordinary. This

waltz I just played is by Johannes Brahms. 

KIRK: Later, Spock. 

SPOCK: Captain, it is written in manuscript. In original manuscript, in

Brahms' own hand, which I recognise. It is totally unknown, definitely

the work of Brahms, and yet unknown. 

KIRK: I think I will go to the laboratory. There may be a way of

reversing the irillium's effect and saving the existing antitoxin. Stay

here. Let me know when Flint and McCoy return.

Captain's log, stardate 5843.75. Have I committed a

grave error in accepting Flint's word that he would deliver the

antidote to us? The precious time I have let pass may result in

disaster for the Enterprise and her crew.

[Laboratory]

(Kirk is having a look around when Rayna enters and

goes to a closed door) 

KIRK: You left us. The room became lonely. 

RAYNA: It is a thirst, a flower dying in the desert. 

KIRK: What? What's in there? 

RAYNA: I do not know. Flint told me never to enter. He denies me

nothing else. 

KIRK: Then why are you here? 

RAYNA: I do not know. I come here when I am troubled, when I would

search myself. 

KIRK: Are you troubled now? 

RAYNA: Yes. 

KIRK: By what? Are you happy here with Flint? 

RAYNA: He is the greatest, kindest, wisest man in the galaxy. 

KIRK: Then why are you afraid? (he embraces her) Don't be afraid. 

(Kirk kisses Rayna. M4 enters and Rayna is scared. Kirk pushes her

away) 

RAYNA: Stop command. Stop. 

(M4 ignores her and pursues Kirk around the room. Spock vapourises it

with his phaser as it starts to fire at Kirk) 

KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock. 

SPOCK: Fortunately, the robot did not detect my presence and deactivate

my phaser.

[Living room]

FLINT: M4 was programmed to defend this household

and its members. No doubt I should have altered its instructions to

allow for unauthorised but predictable actions on your part. It thought

you were attacking Rayna. A misinterpretation. 

KIRK: If it were around right now, it would correct 

(M4 enters) 

FLINT: Too useful a device to be without, really. I created another. It

will now go to the laboratory and join Doctor McCoy. 

(M4 leaves) 

SPOCK: Fascinating. 

FLINT: Be thankful that you did not attack me, Captain. I might have

accepted battle, and I have twice your physical strength. 

KIRK: In your own words, it would be an interesting test of power. 

FLINT: How childish he is, Rayna. Would you call him brave or a fool? 

RAYNA: I'm glad he did not die. 

FLINT: Of course! Death, when unnecessary, is a tragic thing. Doctor

McCoy's in the laboratory with the new ryetalyn. He's satisfied as to

its quality. May I suggest that you wait here patiently, safely. You

have seen that my defence systems operate automatically and not always

in accordance with my wishes. Come, Rayna. Rayna! Come. 

(Rayna reluctantly tears herself away from Kirk, and they both leave) 

KIRK: I don't like the way he orders her around. 

SPOCK: Since we are dependent on Mister Flint for the ryetalyn,

Captain, may I respectfully suggest that you pay less attention to the

young lady if you should encounter her again. Our host's interests do

not appear to be confined to art and science. 

KIRK: He loves her? 

SPOCK: Strongly indicated. 

KIRK: Jealousy. Yes, that would explain the attack, but he seemed to

want us together. The billiard game. He suggested we dance. 

SPOCK: It does appear to defy the male logic as I understand it. 

KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott. 

SCOTT [OC]: Aye, Captain. 

KIRK: Report on the Rigelian fever.

[Bridge]

SCOTT: Nearly everybody aboard has got it, Captain.

We're working a skeleton crew and waiting for the ryetalyn. 

KIRK [OC]: Just a little while longer, Scotty. Report on the computer

search. 

UHURA: There is no report on Mister Flint. He doesn't seem to have any

past.

[Living room]

UHURA [OC]: The planet was purchased thirty years

ago by a Mister Brack, a wealthy financier and recluse. 

KIRK: Run a computer check on Rayna Kapec. Status, legal ward after the

death of her parents. 

UHURA [OC]: Aye, sir. 

KIRK: Kirk out, Mister Scott. 

SPOCK: We have still a greater mystery, Captain. I was able to run a

tricorder scan on Mister Flint. He is human, but there are certain

biophysical peculiarities. Some body function readings are

disproportionate. For one thing, extreme age is indicated on the order

of six thousand years. 

KIRK: Can you confirm that, Mister Spock? 

SPOCK: I shall programme the readings through Doctor McCoy's medical

computer when we return to the ship. 

KIRK: Time factor. 

SPOCK: We must commence ryetalyn injections within two hours and

eighteen minutes or the epidemic will prove fatal to us all. 

KIRK: What's keeping the processing this time?

[Sitting room]

SPOCK [on monitor]: The delay may be deliberate. 

KIRK [on monitor]: As though he's keeping us here for some reason. 

SPOCK [on monitor]: Most interesting. Our host appears to wish us to

linger, yet he is apprehensive. It is logical to assume that we are

being monitored and that he is aware of our every move. 

(Flint turns off the screen) 

RAYNA: You sent the robot to kill him. 

FLINT: It came to protect you. 

RAYNA: My mind could not have summoned it. I was not frightened. 

FLINT: It was defective, then. I would have destroyed it myself. Have I

lied to you? 

RAYNA: Never. 

FLINT: Believe what I say. I would not want Captain Kirk dead. What did

you feel? 

RAYNA: You will let them have the ryetalyn? 

FLINT: Yes. Go to them, if you wish. Say your farewells.

[Living room]

KIRK: Kirk here. 

SCOTT [OC]: Mister Scott, sir. Thereâs no record of a Rayna Kapec in

Federation legal banks. 

KIRK: No award of custody?

[Bridge]

SCOTT: No background at all in any computer banks.

Like Flint.

[Living room]

KIRK: Kirk out. Like Flint. People without a past.

What hold does he have over her? 

SPOCK: Captain, I would suggest that our immediate concern is the

ryetalyn. 

KIRK: Let's find McCoy. 

RAYNA: Captain? 

KIRK: I'll meet you in the lab. 

(Spock leaves) 

RAYNA: I've come to say goodbye. 

KIRK: I don't want to say goodbye.

[Sitting room]

(Flint watches on the monitor as Kirk kisses Rayna,

and she starts to respond) 

FLINT: A last tender encounter, Captain Kirk, to end your usefulness.

[Laboratory]

MCCOY: I tell you, Spock, I was waiting for the

robot to finish the processing, and the next thing I knew it was gone

and so was the ryetalyn. 

SPOCK: Interesting. Obviously, Mister Flint is not yet ready for us to

depart. 

MCCOY: Well, I think we'd better tell Jim. 

SPOCK: The captain wanted us to wait here.

[Living room]

KIRK: Come with me. I offer you happiness. 

RAYNA: I've known security here. 

KIRK: Childhood must end. You love me, not Flint. 

(Rayna dashes out of the room)

[Laboratory]

(Kirk enters) 

MCCOY: Flint lied. The ryetalyn isn't here. 

SPOCK: Picking up tricorder readings, Captain. Apparently the ryetalyn

is behind this door. 

KIRK: Why is Flint playing tricks on us? Apparently we're supposed to

go in and get it, if we can. Well, let's not disappoint the chess

master. Phasers on full. 

(The door opens by itself) 

SPOCK: Captain, I shall get the ryetalyn. 

KIRK: Why you? 

SPOCK: There may be dangers within. 

KIRK: Let's find out. 

SPOCK: Let me go alone, Captain. 

MCCOY: Why? Get to the point, Spock, if there is one. 

KIRK: We'll all go. 

(they go down a short corridor into another laboratory)

[Lab two]

(The vials of ryetalyn are on a table.) 

MCCOY: The ryetalyn. 

(And over by the far wall is a covered figure with the label - Rayna

16. Kirk takes a look at it. It is a bald version of Rayna. They look

further and see others. Rayna 14, Rayna 15.

Captain's log, stardate 5843.8. We have

accomplished our mission and have the ryetalyn ready to combat the

epidemic aboard the Enterprise. But we have also discovered our

benefactor's secret. He has created the perfect woman. Her only flaw,

sheâs not human.

[Lab two]

MCCOY: Physically human but not human. These are

earlier versions of Rayna, Jim. She's an android. 

FLINT: Created here by my hand. Here, the centuries of loneliness were

to end. 

SPOCK: Your collection of Leonardo da Vinci masterpieces, Mister Flint,

they appear to have been recently painted

on contemporary canvas with contemporary materials. And on your piano,

a waltz by Johannes Brahms, an unknown work in manuscript, written in

modern ink. Yet absolutely authentic, as are your paintings. 

FLINT: I am Brahms. 

SPOCK: And da Vinci? 

FLINT: Yes. 

SPOCK: How many other names shall we call you? 

FLINT: Solomon, Alexander, Lazarus, Methuselah, Merlin, Abramson. A

hundred other names you do not know. 

SPOCK: You were born? 

FLINT: In that region of earth later called Mesopotamia, in the year

3834 BC, as the millennia are reckoned. I was Akharin, a soldier, a

bully and a fool. I fell in battle, pierced to the heart and did not

die. 

MCCOY: Instant tissue regeneration coupled with some perfect form of

biological renewal. You learned that you were immortal and 

FLINT: And to conceal it. To live some portion of a life, to pretend to

age and then move on before my nature was suspected. 

SPOCK: Your wealth and your intellect are the product of centuries of

acquisition. You knew the greatest minds in history. 

FLINT: Galileo, Socrates, Moses. I have married a hundred times,

Captain. Selected, loved, cherished. Caressed a smoothness, inhaled a

brief fragrance. Then age, death, the taste of dust. Do you understand?



SPOCK: You wanted a perfect, ultimate woman, as brilliant, as immortal

as yourself. Your mate for all time. 

FLINT: Designed by my heart. I could not love her more. 

KIRK: Spock, you knew? 

SPOCK: I had hoped I was wrong. 

FLINT: You cannot love an android, Captain. I love her. She is my

handiwork, my property. She is what I desire. 

KIRK:: You brought me here to learn this? Does she know? 

FLINT: She will never know. 

KIRK: Let's go. 

FLINT: You will stay. 

KIRK: Why? 

SPOCK: We have discovered what he is, Captain. 

FLINT: If you leave, the curious would follow, the foolish, the

meddlers, the officials, the seekers. My privacy was my own. Its

invasion be on your head. 

SPOCK: We can remain silent. 

FLINT: The disaster of intervention, Spock. I've known it. I will not

risk it. 

KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. 

(We see Flint press a button, and the Enterprise disappear from its

orbit) 

KIRK: Clear out of the area. Inform Starfleet Command. Enterprise?

Scotty? 

FLINT: They cannot answer, Captain. 

(A model Enterprise appears on a table. Kirk peers in through the

viewscreen to see everyone stationary) 

KIRK: My crew. 

FLINT: The test of power. You had no chance. It is time for you to join

your crew. 

KIRK: You'd wipe out four hundred lives? Why? 

FLINT: I have seen a hundred billion fall. I know death better than any

man. I have tossed enemies into his grasp. And I know mercy. Your crew

is not dead, but suspended. 

KIRK: Worse than dead! Restore them. Restore my ship! 

FLINT: In time. A thousand, two thousand years. You will know the

future, Captain Kirk. 

MCCOY: You have been such men. You've known and created such beauty.

You've watched your race evolve from cruelty and barbarism

throughout your enormous life, and yet now you would do this to us? 

FLINT: The flowers of my past. I hold the nettles of the present. I am

Flint now, with my needs. 

KIRK: What needs? 

FLINT: Tonight I have seen something wondrous, something I've waited

for, laboured for. Nothing must endanger it. At last, Rayna's emotions

have stirred to life. Now they will turn to me in this solitude which I

preserve. 

RAYNA: No. 

FLINT: Rayna. 

RAYNA: You must not do this to them. 

FLINT: I must. 

SPOCK: What will you feel for him after we are gone? 

MCCOY: All emotions are in play, Mister Flint. You harm us, she hates

you. 

KIRK: Give me back my ship. Your secret is safe with us. 

(The model Enterprise disappears, and appears back in orbit) 

KIRK: That's why you delayed the processing of the ryetalyn. You

realised what was happening. You kept us together, Rayna and me,

because you knew I could bring her emotions alive. And now youâre just

going to take over. 

FLINT: I shall take what is mine when she comes to me. We are mated,

Captain, alike, immortal. You must forget your feelings in this matter,

which is quite impossible for you. 

KIRK: Impossible? Impossible. From the beginning, you used me. I can't

love her, but I do love her. And she loves me. 

FLINT: No! 

(They tussle) 

SPOCK: Captain, your primitive impulses will not alter the

circumstances. 

KIRK: Stay out of this. We're fighting over a woman. 

SPOCK: No, you're not, for she is not. 

(Flint thumps Kirk, then repeatedly throws him across the room) 

RAYNA: I cannot be the cause of this. I will not be the cause of this.

Please stop. Stop! I choose where I want to go. 

(The men stop fighting in astonishment) 

RAYNA: what I want to do. I choose. I choose. 

FLINT: Rayna! 

RAYNA: No. Do not order me. No one can order me! 

KIRK: She's human. Down to the last blood cell, she's human. Down to

the last thought, hope, aspiration, emotion, sheâs human. The human

spirit is free. You have no power of ownership. She's free to do as she

wishes. 

SPOCK: Gentlemen, I urge you to stop. There is a danger. 

FLINT: No man beats me. 

KIRK: I don't want to beat you. This is no test of power. Rayna belongs

to herself and she claims the human right of choice to be as she wills,

to do as she wills, to think as she wills. 

FLINT: That's what I've worked for. 

KIRK: Rayna, come with me. 

FLINT: Stay. 

RAYNA: I was not human. Now I love. I love. 

(She collapses. McCoy checks for a pulse) 

FLINT: You can't die. 

KIRK: What happened? 

SPOCK: She loved you, Captain. And you, too, Mister Flint, as a mentor,

even as a father. There was not enough time for her to adjust to the

awful power and contradictions of her new-found emotions. She could not

bear to hurt either of you.

The joys of love made her human, and the agonies of love destroyed her.

[Kirk's quarters]

KIRK: Spock. 

SPOCK: The epidemic is reduced and no longer a threat. The Enterprise

is on course five one three mark seven, as you ordered. 

KIRK: A very old and lonely man. And a young and lonely man. We put on

a pretty poor show, didn't we? If only I could forget. 

(He rests his head on his arms, on the desk. McCoy enters) 

MCCOY: Jim. Oh, thank heaven, sleeping at last. 

SPOCK: Your report, Doctor. 

MCCOY: Oh, those tricorder readings on Mister Flint are finally

correlated: He's dying. You see, Flint, in leaving Earth with all of

its complex fields within which he was formed, sacrificed immortality.

He'll live the remainder of a normal life span, then die. 

SPOCK: On that day, I shall mourn. Does he know? 

MCCOY: Yes, I told him myself. He intends to devote the remainder of

his years and great abilities to the improvement of the human

condition. And who knows what he might come up with. 

SPOCK: Indeed. 

MCCOY: Well, I guess that's all. I can tell Jim later or you can.

Considering his opponent's longevity, truly an eternal triangle. You

wouldn't understand that, would you, Spock? You see, I feel sorrier for

you than I do for him because you'll never know the things that love

can drive a man to. The ecstasies, the miseries, the broken rules, the

desperate chances, the glorious failures, the glorious victories. All

of these things you'll never know simply because the word love isn't

written into your book. Goodnight, Spock. 

SPOCK: Goodnight, Doctor. 

MCCOY: I do wish he could forget her. 

(McCoy leaves. Spock goes over to Kirk and initiates a mind meld) 

SPOCK: Forget.

The

Way To Eden

Stardate:

5832.3

Original Airdate: 21 Feb, 1969

  [Bridge]

 (A small craft, which looks like a Tholian dart

with small nacelles, is being pursued by the Enterprise) 

SPOCK: It is definitely the stolen space cruiser, Captain, the Aurora.

I read six aboard. 

KIRK: Hailing frequencies. Aurora, this is the USS Enterprise, Captain

James T. Kirk commanding. Acknowledge. Aurora, this is the Enterprise.

Do you read me? 

PALMER: They are receiving us, Captain. 

SPOCK: I read no evidence of malfunction. 

KIRK: Repeat. Federation orders to detain you for 

SULU: They're veering off, sir. 

KIRK: Change course. Pursue and overtake. 

CHEKOV: Aye, aye, sir. 

KIRK: Stand by tractor beams. 

SULU: Standing by, sir. 

CHEKOV: If it continues on course, it will enter Romulan space. 

KIRK: Engage. 

SULU: Tractor beam engaged. 

KIRK: Bring them in. 

SULU: They've not cut power, sir. They're struggling to escape. 

SPOCK: Their engines are seriously overheating, Captain. 

KIRK: Aurora, cut power. You are overtaxing your ship. 

SPOCK: Power approaching critical. They cannot continue. 

KIRK: Emergency power to tractor beams. Bridge to Transporter room.

Scotty, are you ready to transport?

[Transporter room]

SCOTT: Aye, Captain.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Power beyond critical. Explosion is

imminent. 

(The little ship glows red) 

KIRK: Are we within transportation range? 

CHEKOV: Not yet, sir. 

KIRK: Aurora personnel, stand by to be transported aboard. Energise. 

(The little ship makes a big bang) 

KIRK: Are they aboard? Scotty, are they aboard?

[Transporter room]

SCOTT: Aye, Captain. They are, and a nice lot too. 

(Say hello to the 'space hippies')

Captain's log, stardate 5832.3. The son of the

Catullan ambassador is one of six we have beamed aboard from the stolen

cruiser Aurora. We have been ordered to handle him with extreme

delicacy, because the treaty negotiations now in progress between the

Federation and Catualla are in a crucial phase.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Scotty, take them to the briefing room. 

IRINA [OC]: We are not in the mood, Herbert. 

CHEKOV: Irina? 

(The hippies are seated on the floor of the transporter room) 

MAN [OC]: Tell Herbert it's no go. 

ALL [OC]: No go. No go. 

KIRK: What's going on? 

SCOTT [OC]: They refuse, sir. 

KIRK: Why?

[Transporter room]

SCOTT: I don't know. They're sitting on the floor,

the lot of them. You can hear for yourself. Shall I send for security?

[Bridge]

KIRK: No, I'll be right down. Mister Spock. 

ALL [OC]: No go, no go, no go.

[Transporter room]

ALL: No go, no go, no go. 

KIRK: Which one of you is Tongo Rad? 

(A purple haired lad with shaggy eyebrows stands up) 

KIRK: You can thank your father's influence for the fact you're not

under arrest. In addition to piracy, you've left yourself open to

charges of violating flight regulations, entering hostile space and

endangering the lives of others as well as your own. 

RAD: I'm bleeding. 

KIRK: In addition you've caused an interstellar incident which may have

destroyed everything that's been negotiated between your planet and the

Federation. 

RAD: You've got a hard lip, Herbert. 

KIRK: If you have an explanation, I am prepared to hear it. 

(Rad sits down again) 

KIRK: Mister Spock, take them to Sickbay for a medical check. There may

have been radiation from the explosion. 

SPOCK: Captain, with your permission 

KIRK: By all means. 

(Spock steps forward and makes a triangular sign with his hands) 

SPOCK: One. 

SEVRIN: (An older male with alien ears. Obviously the leader) We are

One. 

SPOCK: One is the beginning. 

ADAM: (A red-headed youth) Are you One, Herbert? 

SPOCK: I am not Herbert. 

ADAM: He is not Herbert. We reach. 

SPOCK: If you will state your purpose and your objectives, perhaps we

can arrive at a mutual understanding. 

SEVRIN: If you understand One, you know our purpose. 

SPOCK: I would prefer that you state it. 

SEVRIN: We turn our backs on confusion and seek the beginning. 

SPOCK: What is your destination? 

SEVRIN: The planet Eden. 

KIRK: That planet it is a myth. 

SEVRIN: And we protest against being harassed, pursued, attacked,

seized and transported here against our wishes. 

ADAM: Right, brother. 

SEVRIN: We do not recognise Federation regulations nor the existence of

hostilities. We recognise no authority save that within ourselves. 

KIRK: Well, whether you recognise authority or not, I am it on this

ship. I am under orders to transport you back to Starbase peaceably.

From there you'll be ferried to your various planets. Because of my

orders, you are not prisoners, but my guests. I expect you to behave as

such. 

ADAM: Oh, Herbert, you are stiff! 

KIRK: Mister Spock, you seem to understand these people. You will deal

with them. 

SEVRIN: We respectfully request that you take us to Eden. 

KIRK: And after they are finished in Sickbay, see to it that they're

escorted back to their proper quarters and given whatever care they

need. 

SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 

SEVRIN: We respectfully request that you take us to Eden. 

KIRK: I have orders to the contrary. This is not a passenger ship. 

ADAM: Herbert, Herbert, Herbert. 

ALL: Herbert, Herbert, Herbert. Herbert, Herbert, Herbert.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Lieutenant Palmer, notify Starbase we have

the six aboard who stole the space cruiser Aurora. Regrettably, the

space cruiser itself was destroyed. 

PALMER: Aye, sir. 

KIRK: Personal note to the Catullan ambassador. His son is safe. 

CHEKOV: Captain. 

KIRK: Yes, what is it? 

CHEKOV: Sir, I believe I know one of them. At least, I think I

recognise her voice. Her name is Irina Galliulin. We were in Starfleet

Academy together. 

KIRK: One of those was in the Academy? 

CHEKOV: Yes, sir. She dropped out. She 

KIRK: Do you wish to see her? Permission to leave your post. 

CHEKOV: Thank you, sir. 

(Spock enters) 

KIRK: Are they in the Sickbay? 

SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 

(Chekov leaves) 

KIRK: Mister Spock, do they really believe that Eden exists? 

SPOCK: Many myths are based on truth, Captain, and they are not

unintelligent. Their leader, Doctor Sevrin, is a man 

KIRK: Doctor Sevrin is their leader? 

SPOCK: Yes. A brilliant research engineer in the fields of acoustics,

communications and electronics on Tiburon. He was dismissed from his

post when he started this movement. Tong Rad inherits his father's

extraordinary abilities in the field of space studies. 

KIRK: Well. But they've rejected all that and all that this technology

provides. And they seek the primitive. 

SPOCK: There are many who are uncomfortable with what we have created.

It is almost a biological rebellion. A profound revulsion against the

planned communities, the programming, the sterilised, artfully balanced

atmospheres. They hunger for an Eden where spring comes. 

KIRK: All do. The cave is deep in our memory. 

SPOCK: Yes, that is true, Captain. 

KIRK: But we don't steal space cruisers and act like irresponsible

children. KIRK: What makes you so sympathetic toward them? 

SPOCK: It is not sympathy so much as curiosity, Captain. A wish to

understand. They regard themselves as aliens in their own worlds, a

condition with which I am somewhat familiar. 

KIRK: Spock. What does Herbert mean? 

SPOCK: It is somewhat uncomplimentary, Captain. Herbert was a minor

official notorious for his rigid and limited patterns of thought. 

KIRK: Well, I shall try to be less rigid in my thinking.

[Sickbay]

(The teenagers are having an impromptu concert) 

ADAM: (playing a guitar without a sound box) Looking for the good land,

Going astray. Don't cry, don't cry. Oh, I can't have honey, And I can't

have cream. Gonna live, not die. Gonna live, not die. (Rad plays

bongos) Stand in the middle of it all one day. I'll look at it shining

all around me and say, I'm here, Iç¥ here, In the good land. In the new

land. I'm here. 

CHEKOV: Excuse me. Is Irina Galliulin with you? 

ADAM: She's getting her physical. Gonna crack my knuckles and jump for

joy. I got a clean bill of health from Doctor McCoy. You know Irina? 

RAD: Say, tell me, why do you wear all those clothes? How do you

breathe? 

(Chapel and two med-techs enter) 

CHAPEL: (to Sevrin) You're next. 

(The techs carry Sevrin into the next room. Chapel leaves and Irina

enters) 

CHEKOV: Irina. 

IRINA: Pavel Andreievich. I had thought we might encounter each other. 

CHEKOV: You knew I was on the Enterprise? 

IRINA: I had heard. 

CHEKOV: Irina, why? Come.

[Corridor]

CHEKOV: How could you do this to yourself? You were

a scientist. And now, look at you. 

IRINA: Look at yourself, Pavel. 

CHEKOV: Why did you do it? 

IRINA: Why did you? 

CHEKOV: I am proud of what I am. I believe in what I do. Can you say

that? 

IRINA: Yes. Oh, we should not tear at each other so, Pavel. We should

meet again in joy. Today when I first knew it was your ship that

followed us, I thought of you and wondered what I would find. And I

remembered so much. In spite of that uniform, I still see the same

Pavel I used to know.

[Rec Room]

IRINA: Are you happy in what you do? 

CHEKOV: Yes. 

IRINA: Then I accept what you do. 

CHEKOV: You even talk like them. Why did you go away? 

IRINA: It was you who went. 

CHEKOV: I came back to look for you. I looked. Where did you go? 

IRINA: I stayed in the city, with friends. 

CHEKOV: You never felt as I did. Never. 

IRINA: I did. 

CHEKOV: You don't have it in you to feel so much. Even when we were

close, you weren't with me. You were off thinking of something else.

Why did you stay away? 

IRINA: Because you disapproved of me, Just as you do now. Oh, Pavel,

you have always been like this. So correct. And inside, the struggle

not to be. Give in to yourself. You will be happier. You'll see. 

CHEKOV: Go to your friends. 

(Irina leaves, and there is a commotion in the corridor.)

[Corridor]

ALL: Free Doctor Sevrin! Free Doctor Sevrin! We

want to see him right now! 

ADAM: We want to see him now! 

(Chekov joins the security guards and Chapel trying to keep the kids

out of Sickbay)

[Sickbay]

ALL: Herbert! Herbert! Herbert! Herbert! 

CHAPEL: I thought all the animals were kept in cages. 

KIRK: What's going on, Bones? 

MCCOY: Trouble. Your friend here didn't want a checkup. Turns out

there's a reason. 

SEVRIN: I refuse to accept your findings. 

MCCOY: You don't have the choice. 

SEVRIN: They're the product of prejudice, not science. 

MCCOY: I don't know what this man was planning on doing on a primitive

planet, but assuming one did exist, I can tell you what would have

happened had he settled there. 

SEVRIN: Untrue! 

MCCOY: There wouldn't have been enough primitives left to bury their

dead. 

SEVRIN: Fantasy. Fantasy. 

MCCOY: I wish it were. There's a nasty little bug evolved in the last

few years, Jim. Our aseptic, sterilised civilisations produced it.

Synthococcus novae. It's deadly. We can immunise against it, but

haven't learned to lick all the problems yet. 

KIRK: Does he have it? What about the others? 

MCCOY: All the others are clear. He doesn't have it. He's a carrier.

Remember your ancient history? Typhoid Mary? He's immune, as she was,

but he carries the disease and spreads it to others. 

KIRK: Is the crew in danger? 

MCCOY: I don't know. They all had full spectrum immunisations before

boarding. Now my guess is that his friends have had their shots too.

But a regular programme of shots is necessary. I'll have to check

everyone on the ship. There could be some skips. In the meantime, he

should be placed in total isolation. 

SEVRIN: This is outrageous. You're not isolating me, you're imprisoning

me. You invent a crime, find me guilty and sentence me! 

MCCOY: Would you like to run the test, Doctor? You knew you were a

carrier before you came aboard, didn't you? 

SEVRIN: No! 

MCCOY: Then why did you fight the examination? 

SEVRIN: It was an infringement on my rights. 

KIRK: Put him in isolation. 

(The two med-techs haul Sevrin away) 

MCCOY: Be ready for the objections, Jim. They are a vocal lot. 

KIRK: Yes, I'm ready. Kirk to Security. I want a guard maintained on

Doctor Sevrin until further notice. Bones, how long before we know

whether the crew has been endangered by this infection? 

MCCOY: It'll show in twenty four hours. It's a virulent strain.

[Corridor]

(Sulu is being chatted up by a brunette) 

WOMAN: You don't belong with them! You know what we want. You want it

too. Come, join us. 

SULU: How do you know what I want? 

WOMAN: You're young. Think young, brother! 

SULU: You make it tempting. 

KIRK: Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu, explain. 

SULU: No explanation, sir. 

KIRK: Doctor Sevrin will be released when we think he is medically

safe. 

ADAM: (singing) Stiff man putting my mind in jail. And the judge bang

the gavel and say no bail. Gonna lick his hand and wag my tail. 

ALL: Herbert! Herbert!

[Bridge]

SCOTT [OC]: Engineering to Bridge. 

KIRK: Yes, Scotty, what is it? 

SCOTT [OC]: Captain, I just had to give one of those barefooted what do

you call 'ems the boot out of here. She came in bold as brass, tried to

incite my crew to disaffect. 

KIRK: Thank you, Scotty. Mister Spock, I don't seem to be able to

communicate with these people. Do you think you can persuade them to

behave? 

SPOCK: I shall make an attempt, Captain. 

KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock. If it weren't for that ambassador's son,

they'd all be in the brig. 

SPOCK: Yes, sir.

Captain's log, stardate 5832.5. The arrogance of

Doctor Sevrin and his followers is creating an intolerable situation

aboard the Enterprise. If it continues, Iå¤l be forced to use controls

which might not agree with Starfleet's suggestion that they be handled

with extreme tolerance.

[Brig]

SEVRIN: I have no influence over what they do. 

SPOCK: They respect you. They will listen to your reasoning. For their

sake, you must stop them. Doctor Sevrin, I'm in a position to help you

and your group. I can use the resources of the Enterprise to determine

whether or not Eden actually exists and to plot its exact location. I

can present a case to Federation to allow you and your group to

colonise that planet. Neither you nor your people are at present

charged with a crime. However, incitement to disaffection is criminal.

The Federation will never allow the colonisation of a planet by

criminals. If they persist, they will be so charged and forever barred

from Eden. 

SEVRIN: As I have been barred. 

SPOCK: Then you knew you were a carrier. 

SEVRIN: Of course I knew. You've researched my life. You've read the

orders restricting me to travel only in areas of advanced technology

because of what my body carries. 

SPOCK: What I fail to understand is why you disobey those orders. 

SEVRIN: Because this is poison to me. This stuff you breathe, this

stuff you live in, the shields of artificial atmosphere that we have

layered about every planet. The programs in those computers that run

your ship and your lives for you, they bred what my body carries.

That's what your science have done to me. You've infected me. Only the

primitives can cleanse me. I cannot purge myself until I am among them.

Only their way of living is right. I must go to them. 

SPOCK: Your very presence will destroy the people you seek. Surely you

know that. 

SEVRIN: I shall go to them and be One with them. And together we shall

build a world such as this galaxy has never seen.

A world. A life. A life. So now you're going to try to persuade me that

your technologies will find a cure for me, and then I'll be free to go.



SPOCK: Yes, Doctor. 

SEVRIN: And for that reason I should persuade my friends to behave so

that they too will be allowed. 

SPOCK: Yes, Doctor. 

SEVRIN: All right, you send them in. I'll talk to them.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Doctor Sevrin is insane. I've not consulted

Doctor McCoy, but I have no doubt of it. 

KIRK: I'll have Bones check him out. Spock, I'm sorry. You had great

respect for him. But it does explain some of what they've done. 

SPOCK: His condition does not affect my interest in the movement. There

is no insanity in what they seek. I made a promise which I should like

to keep. With your permission, I must locate Eden. I shall work in my

quarters. May I have the assistance of Mister Chekov in auxiliary

control? 

KIRK: Certainly. Mister Chekov, assist Mister Spock. Bridge to Sickbay.



MCCOY [OC]: McCoy here. 

KIRK: Bones. 

MCCOY [OC]: Yes, Captain. 

KIRK: I'd like to talk to you.

Captain's log, stardate 5832.6. I have asked Doctor

McCoy to check Starfleet medical records to verify Mister Spock's

suspicion that Doctor Sevrin is insane. In spite of Doctor Sevrin's

antipathy to us, he has promised Mister Spock that he will order his

disciples to conform to our rules and regulations.

[Spock's quarters]

SPOCK: Come in. 

ADAM: Am I crossing you? 

SPOCK: No. 

ADAM: I was just thinking, I (sees the lyre) Hey, brother, do you play?

Is it Vulcan? Can I try it? 

(Spock gestures his permission and the young man strums a chord) 

ADAM: Oh ho, that's now. That's real now. I reach that, brother. I

really do. Give. 

(He hands the lyre to Spock who plays it briefly) 

ADAM: Hey, how about a session, you and us? It would sound. That's what

I came for. I wanted to ask, you know, great white captain upstairs,

but he don't reach us. But would he shake on a session? I mean, we want

to co-operate, like you ask, so I'm asking. 

SPOCK: If I understand you correctly, I believe the answer might be

yes. 

ADAM: I'll spread the word.

[Auxiliary control]

IRINA: Am I allowed in? 

CHEKOV: Yes. 

IRINA: I have been looking for you, Pavel. What room is this? 

CHEKOV: Auxiliary control. 

IRINA: What's it for? 

CHEKOV: Should the main control room breakdown or suffer damage, we can

navigate the ship from here. What do you want? 

IRINA: To apologise. I should not have teased you. It was cruel. 

CHEKOV: It does not matter. 

IRINA: Oh, but it does. It is against everything I believe in. 

CHEKOV: Let us not discuss your beliefs. 

IRINA: And I do not like having you angry with me, or disapproving. 

CHEKOV: Then why do you do such things? 

IRINA: What are you working on? 

CHEKOV: I am assisting Mister Spock in locating your Eden. 

IRINA: Oh, now you are teasing me. 

CHEKOV: I am not. These tapes contain star charts, and we project the

orbits of the various planets here. By mathematical process, we

determine whether or not they are affected by other bodies not yet

charted. 

IRINA: Do you know all these things? 

CHEKOV: What I do not know I find out from the computer banks. If, if I

knew nothing at all, I could navigate the ship simply by studying what

is stored in there. They contain the sum of all human knowledge. They

solve our problems of navigation. Of control. Of life support. 

IRINA: They tell you what to do, and you do what they tell you. 

CHEKOV: No. We use our own judgment also. 

IRINA: I could never obey a computer. 

CHEKOV: You could never listen to anyone. You always had to be

different. 

IRINA: Not different. What I wanted to be. There is nothing wrong in

doing what you want. 

(Chekov gives in, and kisses her) 

SPOCK [OC]: I am not receiving, Mister Chekov. Spock to Chekov. Repeat,

I am not receiving. 

CHEKOV: I am sorry, Mister Spock. I was momentarily delayed.

[Guest quarters]

RAD: His name is Sulu, specialist in weapons and

navigation. His hobby is botany. 

ADAM: Can? 

RAD: Can. I reach botany. It's my favorite of studies. What's yours? 

ADAM: Vulcan. Spock is practically One now. 

IRINA: Everything can be handled from auxiliary control. The computers

contain all the information we need. We can do it. 

ADAM: It starts to chime. 

RAD: When will it? 

ADAM: Soon. Like he said now, we should all go out and swing as many as

possible over. 

RAD: Can you suggest any special ways to swing them? 

ADAM: Just be friendly. You know how to be friendly. Then they'll be

friendly.

[Rec room]

(Sounds are being laid down in a session and piped

through the ship) 

ADAM: (singing) Iç¥ talkin ''bout you, Iç¥ talkin ''bout me. Long time

back when the galaxy was new. Man found out what he had to do. Found he

had to eat and he found he had to drink. And a long time later he found

he had to think. Uh huh. Yes, think. I'm standing here wondering. 

ALL: What? 

ADAM: If a man tells another man out of my way. He piles up trouble for

himself all day. But all kinds of trouble come to an end. When a man

tells another man be my friend, uh huh. My friend. Well, what's it

going to be? 

GIRL: (singing) There's a mile wide emptiness between you and me. 

(Spock arrives with his lyre) 

ADAM: Can't reach across it, hardly even see. 

GIRL: Someone ought to take a step one way or other. 

ADAM: (with chorus) Let's say goodbye, or let's say brother. Brother.

Brother. Hey, out there. Hey, out there. Hey, out there. Hey, out

there. I see you. I see you. I see you. I see you. Let's get together

and have some fun. I don't know how to do it but it's got to be done. 

(Then Spock plays, accompanied by a girl playing what looks like a

wire-spoked wheel) 

(In the Brig, Rad climbs up a ladder and uses pressure points to knock

out the guard. Then he releases Sevrin from his cell)

[Bridge]

(Many of the crew are moving to the beat) 

SCOTT: At least we know where they are and what they're doing. I don't

know why a young mind has to be an undisciplined one. They're

troublemakers. 

KIRK: I used to get into a little trouble when I was that age, Scotty.

Didn't you? 

(Rad takes out the man on duty in Auxiliary control, then he and Sevrin

sit down and start changing things) 

SULU: Captain, I get no response from controls. We're going off course.



SCOTT: It's shorted. No, it's channeled over somewhere. To auxiliary

control. 

KIRK: Bridge to auxiliary control. Bridge to auxiliary control. 

SULU: Captain, it seems as though someone else is running the ship. 

SEVRIN [OC]: That's right, someone else is running this ship.

[Auxiliary control]

(All his followers are there now) 

SEVRIN: I am. All functions, life support as well. You cannot

interfere, as I have frozen the doors to the control room.

[Bridge]

SEVRIN [OC]: I do not intend to hand over the helm

to you until and unless we reach Eden.

[Auxiliary control]

SEVRIN: If I am in any way prevented from reaching

that destination, I shall destroy this ship and all aboard.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Can he do it? 

SPOCK: He has the capability, Captain.

[Auxiliary control]

SCOTT [OC]: Heç´ got everything channelled over.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Start a trace-back of all circuits.

[Auxiliary control]

KIRK [OC]: See if you can bypass him. 

SEVRIN: Do that, and I shall retaliate.

[Bridge]

SEVRIN [OC]: I shall not warn you again. 

SULU: Captain, we're now leaving the Neutral Zone. Bearing into Romulan

space! 

KIRK: Any patrols? 

SPOCK: Negative. 

KIRK: There will be soon. Doctor Sevrin. You are violating Romulan

space and endangering the peace of the galaxy.

[Auxiliary control]

KIRK [OC]: The Romulans will view this as a

military intrusion and attack. Bring the ship about now. If you bring

her about

[Bridge]

KIRK: And return to Starbase, no charges will be

leveled.

[Auxiliary control]

ADAM: Like you said, Brother Sevrin.

[Bridge]

KIRK: If you do not, you will never reach Eden. You

and this ship will be destroyed. 

ADAM [OC]: He's got jelly in the belly. Real scared. 

KIRK: Adam.

[Auxiliary control]

KIRK [OC]: Rad.

[Bridge]

KIRK: You are being led by a man who is insane.

[Auxiliary control]

KIRK [OC]: You are being used by him.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Spock, you tell them. 

SPOCK: Adam, there is a file on Doctor Sevrin in our computer banks. In

it you'll find a report attesting to the fact

[Auxiliary control]

SPOCK: That he is a carrier of a bacillus strain

known as Synthococcus novae. 

ADAM: (sarcastic) Ain't that just awful.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: You'll also find a report from the same

hospital, giving a full psychological profile on him and projecting

these actions of his.

[Auxiliary control]

ADAM: Yay, brother.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Adam. You know I reach you. I believe in

what you seek. But there is a tragic difference between what you want

and what he wants.

[Auxiliary control]

ADAM: You're making me cry. 

RAD: There it is. They've established Eden, Brother Sevrin. 

IRINA: Pavel said they would. Our original course must have been

somewhat in error. 

SEVRIN: When will we get there? 

RAD: At this speed, three hours. 

SEVRIN: They'll try to persuade us to change course presently and then

they'll attack. 

RAD: How do you plan to stop them? By cutting off their life support? 

SEVRIN: I have another weapon. Take control, Brother Rad. 

(Sevrin takes the cover off a wall access point) 

ADAM: What are you doing? 

SEVRIN: Making an adjustment on their circuits. 

ADAM: (singing) Headin' out to Eden. Yea, brother. Headin' out to Eden.

No more trouble in my body or my mind. Gonna live like a king on

whatever I find, Eat all the fruit and throw away the rind. Yea,

brother. Yea.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: We are within sensor range of Eden and

continuing to approach. 

KIRK: Whatever they're going to do, they're going to do now. We have no

choice. Mister Spock, Mister Scott.

[Auxiliary control]

ADAM: When will you use that? 

SEVRIN: At the proper time. Let me know when we're in orbit. 

RAD: Approaching right on the dot, just as they plotted it, Brother

Sevrin. 

IRINA: What will that do to them? What is it? 

SEVRIN: Well, I'm using sound against them, beyond the ultrasonic. It

will stun them and allow us time to leave. We'll go in one of their

shuttlecraft. 

IRINA: Sound pitched that high doesn't stun, it destroys. I remember

when we read in the text that it 

SEVRIN: I've gone beyond those texts, Irina. It's correct for you to be

concerned, but be assured also. 

RAD: We are in orbit over Eden, Brother Sevrin. It does destroy. 

SEVRIN: We cannot allow them to come after us. It will not reach us in

here. I can control it all. I have adjusted it so that it will suspend

its effects after a few moments and allow us time to escape. Then,

after we've gone, it will automatically reactivate.

Rejoice, brethren. Soon we shall step together into Eden. 

(A flame appears in the wall behind them)

[Corridor]

(Scott is trying to cut into the room with a

phaser. Sevrin turns on his sonic weapon and Spock is instantly

stricken with pain) 

KIRK: Spock! It's all right, Spock. It stopped. 

SPOCK: No, Captain, it hasn't stopped. It has gone beyond 

(Now it affects Kirk. Scott is already unconscious) 

SPOCK: Captain, they're using 

(All over the ship, people fall to the floor)

[Auxiliary control]

ADAM: Steppin' into Eden. Yea, brother. Steppin'

into Eden. Yea, brother. No more trouble in my body or my mind. Gonna

live like a king on whatever find. Eat all the fruit and throw away the

rind. Yea, brother. 

SEVRIN: Now we may leave.

[Corridor]

(Scott, Kirk and Spock are waking up) 

SPOCK: (in pain) Captain, go. I. You must destroy the 

KIRK: What is it? 

SPOCK: Ultrasonics. The panel.

[Auxiliary control]

(Kirk staggers into the room and turns off the

sound) 

KIRK: Kirk to Engineering. Bridge? Hangar deck? Kirk to Transporter

Room. Kirk to Bridge. Do you read me? Come in. 

SULU [OC]: Sulu here, Captain. What happened to us? I heard a whistle,

and then 

KIRK: Never mind. Do we have control of the ship? 

CHEKOV [OC]: No, sir. Control is in auxiliary. 

KIRK: Can we break out of orbit if we have to? 

SULU: I think so, sir. 

CREWMAN [OC]: Hangar Deck to Captain. 

KIRK: Kirk here. 

CREWMAN: Sir, one of the shuttlecrafts has been taken. We were all

knocked out. 

KIRK: Stand by. Do you read any Romulans? 

SPOCK: Negative, Captain. However I am picking up the shuttlecraft. 

KIRK: Where? 

SPOCK: It has landed. Except for those aboard the craft, I read no life

at all, either humanoid nor animal. 

KIRK: Auxiliary control to Doctor McCoy. Bones, are you all right? 

MCCOY [OC]: Yes, Jim. 

KIRK: Stand by, transporter room. Full medical gear. 

CHEKOV [OC]: Bridge to Captain Kirk. Do you wish to open communication,

sir? 

KIRK: No. No, they tried to destroy us. Let them think they succeeded.

I want the co-ordinates zeroed in so that when we beam down, we won't

be visible to them. Scotty, you have the conn. If any Romulans appear,

try to make them understand. I do not want to provoke combat. Mister

Spock. Mister Chekov, join us in the transporter room.

[Planet surface]

(Looking remarkable like Miramanee's planet, right

down to the lake. Or maybe the Pleasure Planet?) 

SPOCK: The legends were true, Captain. Fantastically beautiful planet. 

CHEKOV: Eden. 

KIRK: Is this what they believed they'd find? Then I can understand.

Spread out. Approach with caution. (into communicator) Doctor Sevrin. 

(Chekov screams) 

KIRK: What is it? 

CHEKOV: The flower, sir. I touched it. It's like fire. 

(His palm is covered in blisters) 

MCCOY: It's burned. All this plant life is full of acid. Even the

grass, Jim. 

KIRK: Will our clothing protect us? 

MCCOY: It should for a while. 

SPOCK: Captain. 

(Our young minstrel is spread out on the ground, a half-eaten fruit

beside him) 

KIRK: Bones? 

MCCOY: Poison. The fruit is deadly. 

SPOCK: His name was Adam. 

KIRK: There's the shuttlecraft.

[By the Galileo II]

(The door opens. The hippies have blisters on their

feet and can't walk. Kirk picks up Irina and carries her) 

KIRK: Here, we'll help you. 

(The youngsters come out, and finally Sevrin) 

KIRK: Doctor Sevrin. Bones! 

MCCOY: He should be beamed aboard, Jim. He needs more than I can do for

him here. 

SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise. 

SCOTT [OC]: Enterprise here. 

SPOCK: Stand by to beam aboard injured parties. Medical team to the

transporter room. 

SEVRIN: No, we're not leaving. 

KIRK: We can help you aboard the ship. 

SEVRIN: We're not leaving Eden, none of us. 

KIRK: Be sensible, Doctor. 

SEVRIN: We're not leaving. 

(Sevrin runs off on his blistered feet and climbs a fruit tree) 

MCCOY: Come back here, you fool! 

KIRK: Sevrin, don't! You'll kill yourself! 

MCCOY: Don't bite into that! 

KIRK: Stop! 

(But man takes a bite of the forbidden fruit, and loses Eden forever) 

IRINA: It was so beautiful.

[Bridge]

PALMER: I have Starbase now, Captain. 

KIRK: Alert them that we have the four and we're ready to beam them

down. And mark the incident closed. 

PALMER: Aye, sir. 

KIRK: Bridge to Transporter. Scotty, are they there? 

SCOTT [OC]: Three of them, sir. Expecting a fourth any minute. 

KIRK: Stand by. Mister Chekov, do you wish to attend? 

CHEKOV: Captain, I wish first to apologise for my conduct during this

time. I did not maintain myself under proper discipline. I endangered

the ship and its personnel by my conduct. I respectfully submit myself

for disciplinary action. 

KIRK: Thank you, Mister Chekov. You did what you had to do. As did we

all. Even your friends. You may go. 

CHEKOV: Thank you, sir. 

(Irina enters) 

CHEKOV: I was coming to say goodbye. 

IRINA: And I was coming to say goodbye to you. (a kiss) Be incorrect,

occasionally. 

CHEKOV: And you be correct. 

IRINA: Occasionally. 

SPOCK: Miss Galliulin. It is my sincere wish that you do not give up

your search for Eden. I have no doubt but that you will find it, or

make it yourselves. 

IRINA: Thank you. 

(Irina leaves) 

KIRK: We reach, Mister Spock.

The

Cloud Minders

Stardate:

5818.4

Original Airdate: 28 Feb, 1969

 

Captain's log, stardate 5818.4. A botanical plague is devastating a

planet in the quadrant of the galaxy where the Enterprise is operating

at present. It threatens to destroy the vegetation on the entire

planet, leaving it uninhabitable.

[Bridge]

KIRK: (dictating) At Federation orders, we're

proceeding at top warp speed to the planet Ardana, where the only

source of zenite exists. It is the one substance that can halt the

plague. 

UHURA: Captain, the High Advisor of Ardana is ready to receive you on

Stratos, sir. 

KIRK: On Stratos? That's their cloud city, isn't it, Mister Spock? 

SPOCK: It is, Captain. 

KIRK: There must be some mistake. Do you have the co-ordinates to the

mine entrance available? 

SPOCK: They've already been provided to the transport officer, Captain.

Along with those of the council chamber of the High Advisor. 

KIRK: Kirk to transporter room. 

SCOTT [OC]: Ready to transport, Captain. 

KIRK: Mister Scott, are you locked in on the mine entrance or on their

cloud city, Stratos? 

SCOTT: The mine entrance. That's what you ordered, Captain. 

KIRK: Fine. Uhura. Tell the High Advisor that we request to dispense

with the welcoming ceremonies due to the emergency, and that we're

beaming directly down to the mine entrance in order to ensure the

fastest possible delivery of the zenite. The need is urgent. 

UHURA: Aye, sir. 

KIRK: Mister Spock, come with me. Oh, and tell them that we appreciate

the honour and that we look forward to some visit in the future. 

UHURA: Aye, sir.

[Mine entrance]

(An area with jagged purple rocks under an orange

sky. Kirk and Spock arrive on an artificial platform and gaze up at a

city literally in the clouds.) 

SPOCK: Stratos, Captain. A city actually floating in the sky. 

KIRK: Looks as tranquil as its reputation, doesn't it. 

SPOCK: It is one of the most interesting metropolises in the galaxy.

Have you ever visited here, Captain? 

KIRK: Once. I didn't have time to look around. 

SPOCK: I've never had the opportunity. However, I hear its art forms

are incomparable. 

KIRK: Yes, art is the population's chief occupation. 

SPOCK: It is a totally intellectual society. All forms of violence have

been eliminated. 

KIRK: There's the mine entrance. The zenite consignment should have

been there. I don't understand it. Those Troglyte miners were supposed

to have made delivery when we beamed down. 

SPOCK: Perhaps there is another entrance, Captain. 

KIRK: Perhaps. 

SPOCK: It would seem the Troglytes have changed their minds about

delivery. 

(Kirk and Spock are lassoed by three people in boiler suits and hard

hats.) 

KIRK: Who are you? What's the meaning of this attack? 

VANNA: (a woman in blue) Interference breeds attack, Captain. Come on! 

KIRK: We're here by permission of your government council on an

emergency mission. 

VANNA: Move on, Captain!. 

(There is a fight, two against four. Then three figures beam down onto

the platform.) 

PLASUS: Troglytes, halt! 

(The attackers make to run off.) 

PLASUS: Surrender or we'll fire! 

(Three escape, one gets shot) 

PLASUS: Are you harmed, gentlemen? 

KIRK: No, just a little shaken up. 

PLASUS: I'm Plasus, High Advisor of the planet council. 

KIRK: Captain Kirk, Enterprise. My first officer, Mister Spock. 

SPOCK: Greetings, Mister Advisor. 

PLASUS: My regrets for the unpleasantness of your welcome to Ardana. 

KIRK: It was rather warm. 

PLASUS: Unfortunately, violence is habitual with the Troglytes. But I

assure you, this insult will not go unpunished. 

KIRK: Well, I'm more concerned with the zenite consignment. Why wasn't

it in its specified location? 

PLASUS: Apparently the Disrupters have confiscated it, as I knew they

would. 

SPOCK: The Disrupters? Who are they? 

PLASUS: A small group of Troglyte malcontents. All the other Troglytes

are completely dominated by them. It's the Disrupters who are

responsible for their refusal to continue mining for zenite. 

KIRK: They agreed to the delivery. Your council assured us of it. 

PLASUS: They agreed obviously as a ruse to get valuable hostages. 

KIRK: Hostages? For what purpose? 

PLASUS: To force the council to meet their demands. (to guards)

Organise a search party immediately and find the zenite consignment. 

(Guards leave) 

PLASUS: Meanwhile, Captain, I would suggest that you and First Officer

Spock be our guests on Stratos. 

KIRK: Very well. I do hope the search will be brief, Mister Advisor. 

PLASUS: We'll do everything possible to make it so. Come, gentlemen.

[Stratos - Council gallery]

(Plasus, Kirk and Spock beam onto a balcony at the

edge of Stratos, with a wonderful view of a brown river and its

tributaries.) 

SPOCK: Remarkable. The finest example of sustained antigravity

elevation I've ever seen. 

DROXINE: The sentinel told me of our honoured guests, my father. I came

to extend greetings. 

PLASUS: A most gracious act. One of our planet's most incomparable

works of art. My daughter, Droxine. Captain James Kirk. 

KIRK: Pleasure, madam. 

DROXINE: Indeed, yes, Captain. 

PLASUS: And First Officer Spock. 

DROXINE: I have never before met a Vulcan, sir. 

SPOCK: Nor I a work of art, madam. 

PLASUS: Come, gentlemen. There is much to see in our city. This is our

council gallery. It is open to all city dwellers. We have some of the

finest of our various art forms assembled here for the viewing and

contemplation of every 

(There is a dagger in the wall) 

PLASUS: Disrupters again. 

DROXINE: How dreadful!. They're despoiling the whole city. 

SPOCK: Despoil? For what purpose? 

PLASUS: By keeping us in constant turmoil, they hope to force the

council to accede to their demands. 

KIRK: What are their demands? 

PLASUS: Completely unreasonable, Captain, but nothing you need be

concerned with. 

KIRK: I must concern myself with it if it should interfere with the

delivery of zenite to Merak Two. 

SPOCK: Mister Advisor, the plant life is the source of oxygen on that

planet. Obviously, if all plant life is destroyed, the humanoid life

will follow. 

PLASUS: I assure you, gentlemen, you will get what you came for. 

KIRK: I hope so. Ardana is a member of the Federation, and it is your

council's responsibility that nothing interferes with its obligation to

another member of the Federation. 

PLASUS: Of course, and we accept the responsibility. 

SPOCK: But why do they destroy art forms? That is a loss to everyone. 

PLASUS: Art means nothing to the Disrupters. This (the dagger) is the

only form they understand. The disturbances accompanying your arrival

have been most wearying. No doubt you would like to rest. 

SPOCK: That would be most welcome, Mister Advisor. 

PLASUS: Chambers have been prepared for you. A sentinel will guide you

to them. 

(Kirk and Spock leave) 

DROXINE: I'm sorry they were so poorly treated on their first visit to

our planet. 

PLASUS: It's fortunate that they were not seriously hurt. 

DROXINE: Oh, yes, that would have been dreadful. 

PLASUS: Further violence could create grave difficulties between Ardana

and the Federation. 

DROXINE: The Disrupters must be mad to attack two such charming

strangers. 

PLASUS: They grow more daring and determined every day. Now they seek

to find allies in the galaxy. 

DROXINE: Do you think that Captain Kirk and his very attractive officer

will feel that we're responsible for their injuries? 

PLASUS: All this time I thought you were worried about our diplomatic

relations. 

(Two sentinels drag in a Troglyte) 

SENTINEL: Apologies, Mister Advisor, but this Troglyte was apprehended

leaving the city. He is without a transport card so we thought you

would want to question him. 

PLASUS: Remove his shields. 

(The sentinel takes off the troglyte's sunglasses) 

PLASUS: What is your business in Stratos, Troglyte? Speak! I command

you! 

TROGLYTE: My business is to repair. 

PLASUS: Repair what? 

TROGLYTE: There are damaged entrance panels. 

PLASUS: Indeed. Then you must have a repair permit. Where is it? 

TROGLYTE: It was forgotten. 

PLASUS: Did you also forget your transport card? 

TROGLYTE: It was lost when your sentinels attacked me. 

PLASUS: And where was your cavern implement lost? Could this perhaps be

it? 

TROGLYTE: I came to make repairs. 

PLASUS: And you shall make them by giving us the names of the

Disrupters. 

TROGLYTE: I know nothing. 

PLASUS: I would advise you to increase your knowledge. 

TROGLYTE: That is not possible for a Troglyte. The Stratos city

dwellers have said it. 

PLASUS: Secure him to the rostrum. 

(But the troglyte breaks free of the sentinels and jumps over the

balcony instead.) 

PLASUS: How unfortunate. How unfortunate.

[Guest accommodation]

(Kirk is sleeping, Spock is meditating.) 

SPOCK [OC]: This troubled planet is a place of the most violent

contrasts. Those who receive the rewards are totally separated from

those who shoulder the burdens. It is not a wise leadership. Here on

Stratos, everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant. The High

Advisor's charming daughter Droxine, particularly so. The name Droxine

seems appropriate for her.

I wonder, can she retain such purity and sweetness of mind and be aware

of the life of the people on the surface of the planet? There, the

harsh life in the mines is instilling the people with a bitter hatred.

The young girl who led the attack against us when we beamed down was

filled with the violence of desperation. If the lovely Droxine knew of

the young miner's misery, I wonder how the knowledge would affect her. 

(Spock hears a sound and goes into the next room. Droxine is preparing

refreshments.) 

DROXINE: Mister Spock, I thought you had accompanied Captain Kirk to

the rest chamber. 

SPOCK: Your movements awakened me. 

DROXINE: My apologies. I did not realise they would disturb you. 

SPOCK: Only Vulcan ears would find the noise discernible. 

DROXINE: It seems that Vulcans are fascinatingly different in many

ways. 

SPOCK: The same may be said of Stratos inhabitants. 

DROXINE: Vulcan eyes are very discerning too. I hear that,

intellectually, Vulcans are as highly evolved as Stratos city dwellers.



SPOCK: We do pride ourselves on our logic. 

(Dressed in Stratos fashion, the female miner enters the rest room,

armed with her mining tool. She leans over Kirk, but he grabs her,

pulls her down onto the bed and disarms her.)

KIRK: You again! 

VANNA: You sleep lightly, Captain. 

KIRK: Yes, duty is a good teacher. I see you've changed your

dressmaker. 

VANNA: Release me. 

KIRK: So you can attack me again? That would be foolish. 

VANNA: Call the guards if youâre afraid, Captain. 

KIRK: I'm not afraid. In fact, I find this rather enjoyable. 

VANNA: I do not! 

KIRK: All right, I'll make a deal with you. You answer some questions

and I'll let you up. 

VANNA: What questions? 

KIRK: Your word first. 

VANNA: I will answer. 

(But as soon as he lets go, she grabs for the weapon again and he has

to fight her again.) 

(Meanwhile, in the next room, the ears that heard Droxine don't hear

the fighting) 

DROXINE: You only take a mate once every seven years? 

SPOCK: The seven-year cycle is biologically inherent in all Vulcanâs.

At that time, the mating drive outweighs all other motivations. 

DROXINE: And is there nothing that can disturb that cycle, Mister

Spock? 

SPOCK: Extreme feminine beauty is always disturbing, madam. 

KIRK [OC]: Spock? 

(In the rest area) 

VANNA: I did not come here to kill you, Captain. 

KIRK: Then why this? 

VANNA: To take you hostage. 

Spock and Droxine enter) 

SPOCK: Am I intruding, Captain? 

DROXINE: Vanna! 

VANNA: Droxine. 

DROXINE: Why have you come here? 

VANNA: To welcome our honoured guests as I was taught to do when I

served in your father's household. 

DROXINE: Has she injured you, Captain? 

KIRK: No, not at all. In fact her visit was quite enlightening. 

DROXINE: Oh? 

KIRK: Yes, it seems the Troglytes are under the impression that the

Enterprise is here to intimidate them. 

DROXINE: (into intercom) Send a sentinel to the rest chamber

immediately. 

VANNA: It is not impression, Captain. It is the truth. 

KIRK: We're here to get that zenite consignment, and that's it. 

VANNA: Starships do not transport cargo. 

KIRK: In times of emergency, they do anything. And believe me, this

botanical plague is an emergency. 

VANNA: Lies will not keep the Troglytes in the caverns, and neither

will your starship. 

DROXINE: You talk like a Disrupter, Vanna. 

VANNA: I speak for my people. They have as much right to the clouds as

the Stratos dwellers. 

DROXINE: But Stratos is for advisors and studiers. What would Troglytes

do here? 

VANNA: Live in the sunlight and warmth, as everyone should. 

DROXINE: The caverns are warm and your eyes are not accustomed to

light, just as your minds are not accustomed to logic. 

(A sentinel takes Vanna away) 

KIRK: Unaccustomed to light and warmth? That's necessary to all

humanoids. Surely, you don't deny it to the Troglytes. 

DROXINE: The Troglytes are workers, Captain. Oh surely, you must be

aware of that. They mine zenite for shipment, till the soil. Those

things cannot be done here. 

SPOCK: In other words, they perform all the physical toil necessary to

maintain Stratos. 

DROXINE: That is their function in our society. 

SPOCK: But they are not allowed to share its advantages. 

DROXINE: How can they share what they do not understand? 

KIRK: They can be taught to understand, especially in a society that

prides itself in enlightenment. 

DROXINE: The complete separation of toil and leisure has given Ardana

this perfectly balanced social system, Captain. Why should we change

it? 

SPOCK: The surface of the planet is almost unendurable. To restrict a

segment of the population to such hardship is unthinkable in an evolved

culture. 

DROXINE: The surface is marred by violence, like the Troglytes. But

here in Stratos, we have completely eliminated violence.

[Council gallery]

(Vanna is shackled to a granite-looking device) 

PLASUS: You still refuse to disclose the names of the other Disrupters.



VANNA: There are no Disrupters! 

PLASUS: Very well, if you prefer the rays. 

(The curved section of the device, facing Vanna, lights up and makes

Vanna glow.)

[Guest accomodation]

(The sound of the rays can be heard in the

background) 

SPOCK: Troglyte is an abbreviation of an ancient Earth term. Its

technical translation is cave dweller. 

KIRK: Yes, I should have realised. 

(A scream rings out. Kirk and Spock go to investigate)

[Council gallery]

KIRK: Mister Advisor! 

(The rays are switched off, and Vanna slumps) 

KIRK: You said you were going to question Vanna, not torture her. 

PLASUS: She's stubborn, and as you yourself pointed out, Captain, the

search for your zenite consignment must be short. 

KIRK: Surely there are better methods than this. 

PLASUS: Physical discomfort is extremely persuasive, Captain. 

KIRK: Yes, but I won't stand by while someone is tortured! 

PLASUS: Is it preferable to spare Vanna and allow an entire planet to

be destroyed? 

SPOCK: Violence in reality is quite different from theory, is it not,

madam? 

DROXINE: But what else can they understand, Mister Spock? 

SPOCK: All the little things you and I understand and expect from life,

such as equality, kindness, justice. 

PLASUS: Troglytes are not like Stratos dwellers, Mister Spock. They're

a conglomerate of inferior species. The abstract concepts of an

intellectual society are beyond their comprehension. 

KIRK: The abstract concepts of loyalty and leadership seem clear to

Vanna. 

PLASUS: A few Troglytes are brought here as retainers. Vanna was one of

them, as are the sentinels. They've received more training than the

others. 

KIRK: But obviously no more consideration. 

PLASUS: I fail to see the purpose of this continued criticism. 

KIRK: The only way you'll use that device again is on one of us. 

PLASUS: An imposing display of primitive gallantry, gentlemen. You

realise, of course, that the sentinels could remove you. 

KIRK: Of course, but Starfleet command won't take kindly to having

either rays or physical force used against one of its command

personnel, Mister Advisor. 

PLASUS: Why are you so concerned with this Disrupter's well-being? 

KIRK: Beyond plain humanitarianism, my orders are to get that zenite. 

PLASUS: Then stop interfering, and I'll get it for you. 

KIRK: You won't get it through torture. 

PLASUS: We will get it for you, and in our own way. Remove the prisoner

to confinement quarters. You will return to your ship at once or I

shall contact your Starfleet command myself and report your

interference with this planet's government. 

KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. 

SCOTT [OC]: Enterprise, Captain. 

KIRK: Mister Scott, we're ready to beam up. 

SCOTT [OC]: Aye, sir. 

(Kirk and Spock are beamed away) 

PLASUS: (to sentinel) If Captain Kirk appears again, kill him.

Captain's log, star date 5819.0. More than eight

hours have passed since the consignment of zenite disappeared and we

have still found no trace of it. We've received word from Merak Two

that the plague is spreading rapidly. Delivery of the zenite is

imperative within twelve hours or all life on the planet will be

annihilated.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, advise Starfleet command

that the zenite has not been delivered. In my opinion, Plasus' method

of accomplishing delivery will not succeed. If the zenite is not

delivered shortly, I shall have to violate Plasus' order of

non-interference and win the confidence of the Troglyte leader with the

use of reason. 

MCCOY: That may not be easy, Jim. Medical analysis indicates the

Troglytes are mentally inferior. 

KIRK: That's impossible, Bones. The Troglytes have accepted personal

sacrifice, a common cause. Mentally inferior beings aren't capable of

that. 

MCCOY: Look, I've checked my findings thoroughly. Their intellect

ratings are almost twenty percent below average. 

SPOCK: But they're all the same species. Those who live on Stratos and

those who live below all originated on the planet. Their physical and

mental evolution must be similar. That is basic biological law. 

MCCOY: That's true, Spock, but obviously the ancestors of those who

live on Stratos removed themselves from the environment of the mines.

Therefore they avoided the effects of certain natural growths. 

KIRK: Natural growths? What kind? 

MCCOY: Well. I had this zenite sample sent up from the surface. Now

unsealed, it would have had detrimental effects on everybody here. 

SPOCK: Incredible. Zenite is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there

is danger of plant bacteria. No side effects have ever been reported. 

MCCOY: There are none after itâs refined. But in its raw state, it

emits a odourless, invisible gas that retards the intellectual

functioning of the mind and heightens the emotional. Therefore, it

releases a violent reaction. 

KIRK: And the mines are full of that gas. 

MCCOY: That's right. And the Troglytes are constantly exposed to

it.Â 

KIRK: Bones, the Disrupters, Vanna. It seems impossible. They've

outwitted a highly organised, scientific culture for months. 

SPOCK: As part of the staff of Stratos, Vanna was removed from exposure

for a long period. It is likely that without such exposure, the effect

slowly wears off. 

MCCOY: That's right, Spock. The other Disrupters were probably removed

from exposure too. 

KIRK: Does the brain return to normal? 

MCCOY: According to findings, it should. 

KIRK: Can you neutralise the gas? 

MCCOY: No, but a filter mask should remove the exposure. 

KIRK: Find one. Meet us in the transporter room.

[Transporter room]

(Kirk, Spock and McCoy are talking to Plasus on a

wall monitor) 

KIRK: This mask automatically eliminates all substance injurious to

humanoid life, chemical as well as bacterial. We have used these filter

masks frequently on 

PLASUS [on monitor]: Do you really expect me to believe that that mask

can achieve intellectual equality for the Troglytes? 

MCCOY: There's every indication that the effect of the gas is

temporary, even after repeated exposure. 

PLASUS [on monitor]: How can a mere filter accomplish what centuries of

evolution have failed to do? 

KIRK: Doctor McCoy has analysed the zenite thoroughly. We've checked

his findings through the computer and they're absolutely valid. 

PLASUS [on monitor]: And do your computers explain how my ancestors,

who also dwelt in caverns, evolved sufficiently to erect Stratos while

the Troglytes did not? 

SPOCK: Unequal evolution did not begin until after your ancestors

removed themselves from constant exposure to the gas, Mister Advisor. 

PLASUS [on monitor]: Preposterous. 

KIRK: There's no time to argue about the findings now. I simply propose

to tell Vanna all about them. 

PLASUS [on monitor]: I doubt whether even Vanna will believe such

nonsense! 

KIRK: This nonsense might mean a great deal to the Troglytes. I would

like to offer them a supply of these filter masks in exchange for the

zenite consignment. 

PLASUS [on monitor]: I'm sorry, Captain. Such an offer could only cause

more unrest among them. I cannot allow it until our scientists have

checked the findings. 

MCCOY: But that could take days. 

KIRK: Are you afraid the filter masks will work? Is that why you don't

want the Troglytes to try them? 

PLASUS [on monitor]: You are here to complete an emergency mission, not

conduct tests, Captain. 

KIRK: I am here to get that zenite. If these will help me get them,

I'll use them. 

PLASUS [on monitor]: And I forbid it. Your Federation orders do not

entitle you to defy local governments. This communication has ended. 

KIRK: My diplomacy is somewhat inadequate. 

MCCOY: It's pretty hard to overcome prejudice. 

KIRK: Doesn't give us much choice, does it. 

SPOCK: Nor much time. We have ten hours and forty minutes to deliver

that consignment to Merak Two. 

KIRK: Beam me down to Vanna's confinement quarters. 

MCCOY: You mean you're going back to Stratos against government orders?



KIRK: If Vanna doesn't have something definite to gain for her people,

she'll die rather than turn over that zenite consignment. This is the

only thing that might convince her. 

SPOCK: Captain, if you are apprehended deliberately violating the High

Advisor's orders, he will be within his rights to have you executed, if

he chooses. 

KIRK: If youâre about to suggest that you contact Vanna, the answer is

negative, Spock. That goes for you too, Bones. 

SPOCK: Allow me to point out that a first officer is more expendable

than either a doctor or a captain. 

KIRK: Officially, yes. But this mission is strictly unofficial.

Nobody's to have any part in it, any responsibility for it, but myself.

That's an order, Spock. You have the conn. Stand by till I contact you.

[Vanna's cell]

(It's a fair size, with a bed and table, and

horizontal bars across the doorway) 

KIRK: Vanna, I've brought you a gift. There's a dangerous gas in the

mines that affects the development of the Troglytes exposed to it for a

period of time. This mask will prevent any further damage. 

VANNA: Gas from zenite? 

KIRK: Yes. 

VANNA: It's hard to believe something which is neither seen nor felt

can do so much harm. 

KIRK: That's true. But an idea can't be seen or felt. That's what's

kept the Troglytes in the mines all these centuries,

a mistaken idea. 

VANNA: Would all the Troglytes wear these masks? 

KIRK: Yes. I'll see to it that the Federation engineers construct them.



VANNA: Suppose Plasus does not agree? 

KIRK: Plasus is not the whole government. 

VANNA: That is true, but the city council will not listen to Troglytes.



KIRK: As soon as the zenite is delivered to Merak Two, I'll come back.

I'll request permission to mediate for the Troglytes. Vanna, you must

trust me. I give you my word. 

VANNA: Centuries ago, Stratos was built by leaders that gave their word

that all inhabitants would live there. The Troglytes are still waiting.



KIRK: The zenite can be delivered in a few hours. You won't have long

to wait now. 

VANNA: Hours can be centuries, just as words can be lies. 

KIRK: Vanna, you must trust me. If you don't, millions of people will

die. A whole planet. This zenite is all that can save them. This filter

mask is all that can save the Troglytes. Trust me. Please. 

VANNA: Very well, Captain. I will trust you. The consignment lies deep

in the mines in a place known only to Troglytes.

I cannot direct you. I must take you there. You asked for my trust,

Captain. Are you unwilling to give yours? 

(They hear footsteps) 

VANNA: It's the sentinel with my refreshment. 

(The sentinel enters, puts down the tray and picks up the mask. Kirk

stuns him with his phaser.) 

VANNA: Wait. We'll need a transport pass to leave the city.

[Mine]

(Vanna leads Kirk though tunnels, then uses a tool

to hit the rock three times. Other Troglytes appear.) 

VANNA: Midro. 

MIDRO: Vanna. 

VANNA: Anka. 

ANKA: You have returned. 

VANNA: And I've brought with me a hostage. Seize him! 

KIRK: (wearing the mask) We had a bargain. Why did you break it? 

VANNA: Did you really think I would trust you, Captain? I'm not such a

fool. 

KIRK: I trusted you. 

VANNA: You thought you would trick me with your talk of your filter and

your unseen gas. I don't believe you any more than Plasus does. 

KIRK: Then you are a fool. These masks will free you, just as I said. 

VANNA: Our weapons are our freedom. And youâve just furnished me with

two very valuable ones. Yourself and this. (phaser) 

KIRK: Holding me won't help you. My men'll still come for that zenite

consignment. 

VANNA: Without your communicator, you will be hard to locate. 

KIRK: They'll still come. 

VANNA: Perhaps. In the meantime, a taste of our existence, Captain. Dig

as the Troglytes do. As the Troglytes do. 

KIRK: Without that mask, I haven't 

VANNA: With your bare hands, Captain.

Captain's log, supplemental, stardate 5819.3. First

Officer Spock reporting. Captain Kirk beamed down to Stratos to attempt

to win the confidence of the rebel Troglytes. Unless he has made his

escape from Stratos to the mines, his life is in danger from the High

Advisor. The captain has not informed us of his progress. For our part,

we must maintain silence. We can be of no help to him without

jeopardising his life.

[Mine]

VANNA: You dig well, Captain. The unseen gas

doesn't seem to be harming you. 

KIRK: It takes a while for its effects to be noticed. 

VANNA: Nevertheless, you won't be needing this. Anka, deposit this on

the transport platform so Plasus will know we have something more

valuable to bargain with than our mortaes and thongs. 

ANKA: You are clever, Vanna. Very clever. 

(Anka leaves) 

VANNA: Searchers will be coming soon, Midro. Go to the other mines and

tell the Troglytes to post watchers. 

MIDRO: What of him? 

VANNA: I will see that he doesn't escape. 

MIDRO: If we kill him, there will be no need to see. 

VANNA: A dead hostage is of no value, Midro. 

MIDRO: Only the Troglytes will know. 

VANNA: I brought him here and I will say what is to be done. 

MIDRO: You are not the only Disrupter. I, too, can say. 

VANNA: Can you do nothing but argue? The searchers will be here soon. 

MIDRO: When Anka returns, we will all say. 

(Midro leaves) 

KIRK: Is that what Disrupters are bargaining for, the right to kill

everyone? 

VANNA: Midro is a child. 

KIRK: The masks can change that. 

VANNA: Return to the digging, Captain. 

KIRK: How long do you plan on keeping me here, providing Midro doesn't

kill me, of course? 

VANNA: Until we have help in the mines and our homes are in the clouds.



KIRK: That's quite a while. Longer than I expected. 

(Kirk jumps Vanna, gets the phaser and uses it to cause a rockfall in

the tunnel) 

VANNA: We're sealed in! 

KIRK: Completely. 

VANNA: But soon the atmosphere will go. We'll die. 

KIRK: Die from something that can't be seen? You astound me, Vanna.

Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise.

Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise. 

SPOCK [OC]: Spock here. We've been trying to make contact, Captain. Is

anything wrong? 

KIRK: Nothing. Are you locked in on me?

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Locked in and ready to beam up consignment.

[Mine]

KIRK: Circumstances dictate a slight variation,

Spock.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Standing by for instructions.

[Mine]

KIRK: Hold on these co-ordinates. Locate the High

Advisor and beam him to these co-ordinates immediately. Without advance

communication. Repeat, without advance communication. Have you got

that, Spock?

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Instructions clear. I shall carry them out

immediately. Spock out.

[Mine]

VANNA: You would seal Plasus here also? For what

purpose? 

KIRK: I am preparing a demonstration on the effects of unbelieved gas.

[Bridge]

SCOTT: Beam the High Advisor down without warning,

did he say? 

SPOCK: That's not an exact quote, Mister Scott. However, it does

express the thought. 

SCOTT: I'd like to see the Advisor's face. 

SPOCK: You will have that opportunity. 

SCOTT: The captain did say immediately, did he not? 

SPOCK: Now that is an exact quote, Mister Scott, and I suggest you

handle the transporter yourself. This could be very delicate as a

problem in transporting for us and in diplomacy for the captain. 

SCOTT: Aye.

[Council gallery]

(Droxine is gazing out from the balcony) 

PLASUS: Something's upsetting you, Droxine. 

DROXINE: No, Father. 

PLASUS: What is it? Tell me. 

DROXINE: No, really. I'm not upset. I was just standing here looking

into space and wondering whether or not he would return. 

PLASUS: He will never return. I've seen to that. 

DROXINE: But the zenite is so important to him. He must have it. 

PLASUS: It will be delivered. If we have to kill every Troglyte, it

will be delivered. 

DROXINE: By that time, it may be too late. Perhaps he does have a

method 

PLASUS: He knows nothing except how to destroy our power and our

society. I forbid you ever to speak of Captain Kirk, or even to think

of him.

[Bridge]

SCOTT [OC]: Transporter room to Mister Spock. 

SPOCK: Spock here. 

SCOTT [OC]: I've locked into the co-ordinates of the Cloud City Council

Gallery. Ready to transport the High Advisor. 

SPOCK: You'll have to delay. 

SCOTT [OC]: What's wrong? 

SPOCK: Picking up two life-forms in the gallery.

[Transporter room]

SPOCK [OC]: They are inseparably close to one

another. We cannot transport one

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Without the other. 

SCOTT [OC]: Did you say the word immediately was an exact quote of the

captain's order? 

SPOCK: Precisely, Mister Scott. 

SCOTT [OC]: Well, are we going to do anything about it? 

SPOCK: Until the High Advisor is alone or can be isolated, the captain

will have to wait. Unless you have an alternative? 

SCOTT [OC]: Iâll give it further thought.

[Council gallery]

DROXINE: No, I wasn't thinking of Captain Kirk.

It's the one with those exquisitely shaped ears. His name is Spock.

He's the one I was thinking about. Did you know that he has the most

incredibly sensitive hearing? Why, I almost believe that if I stood

here and called out to him, he would hear my invitation to come and

visit with us for a little while longer. 

PLASUS: Oh, he's no better than his friend. 

DROXINE: Shall we try? 

(a sentinel enters) 

PLASUS: What is it? 

SENTINEL: The Disrupter Vanna has disappeared. Her guard was found half

unconscious. He'd been attacked by Captain Kirk. 

PLASUS: Where is Captain Kirk? 

SENTINEL: He did not know, sir. He did not regain his senses until I

came to his aid. 

PLASUS: This is the kind of reason they use to persuade us. 

DROXINE: They are desperate. 

PLASUS: I will hear no more defence of them. 

DROXINE: I'm sure Mister Spock would not behave so. 

PLASUS: Leave here at once. Go to your music. 

DROXINE: Father, are we so sure of our methods that we never question

what we do?

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Spock to transporter room. 

SCOTT [OC]: Scott here. 

SPOCK: Lock in on Council Gallery co-ordinates. 

SCOTT [OC]: Locked in, sir. 

SPOCK: Energise. 

SCOTT [OC]: Aye, sir.

[Transporter room]

SCOTT: Energising.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: How are you doing, Mister Scott?

[Transporter room]

SCOTT: Fine, Mister Spock. The High Advisor's

materialising on the platform.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Beam him down to Captain Kirk immediately. 

SCOTT [OC]: Energising, sir. He's on his way to the captain. 

SPOCK: Good work, Mister Scott. 

SCOTT [OC]: The Advisor looked mighty angry. I hope he doesn't give the

captain too much trouble. 

SPOCK: The captain will employ his usual diplomatic balm.

[Mine]

PLASUS: Abduction of a planet official is a serious

crime. You will pay for this, I promise you. 

KIRK: Not until you're convinced of the effects of the zenite gas,

Mister Advisor. 

PLASUS: What effects? I've been here nearly an hour of your Earth time.

You and Vanna even longer. I see no changes in any of us! 

KIRK: Perhaps you need closer exposure. Fill that container. 

PLASUS: Are you suggesting that I dig zenite? 

KIRK: I insist. 

PLASUS: You will indeed pay for this. 

KIRK: You too, Vanna. You too! Dig! Kirk here. What is it?

[Transporter room]

SPOCK: Contact check, Captain. It has been over an

hour since your last communication.

[Mine]

KIRK: Your orders are to stand by. Now, carry them

out! Kirk out.

[Transporter room]

SPOCK: Standing by, Captain.

[Mine]

SPOCK [OC]: However, let me remind you, we have

only five hours left to 

(Kirk closes his communicator)

[Transporter room]

SPOCK: That is very unlike the captain. 

MCCOY: Can the zenite be affecting him?

[Mine]

VANNA: I grow faint. The oxygen is going. 

PLASUS: She's right. Kirk, transport us out of here. 

KIRK: We'll leave when the gas has effect. 

PLASUS: It will never take effect. Transport us out of here! 

KIRK: Dig! 

PLASUS: Imbecile! We'll die! 

KIRK: I said dig! 

PLASUS: I am High Advisor of all the planet. I will take no more

orders! 

KIRK: One more step and I'll kill you. 

VANNA: The gas! Captain, you were right. It's taking effect! Captain,

you were right! 

PLASUS: Are you as brave with mortae as you are with a phaser? 

KIRK: Both will kill. 

(Kirk throws his phaser away, and Plasus attacks him with two mortae.

Kirk quickly disarms him, and they wrestle instead. Vanna

notices the communicator has fallen off Kirk's belt, and picks it up) 

VANNA: Enterprise! Enterprise, help! Enterprise!

[Transporter room]

SPOCK: Enterprise, Spock here. 

VANNA [OC]: They'll kill each other. Help us.

[Mine]

VANNA: Help us! Enterprise!

[Transporter room]

VANNA [OC]: Enterprise! 

(Spock activates the transporter. Kirk and Plasus have their hands

around each others throats when they materialise. Spock hauls Kirk away

from Plasus)

SPOCK: Captain, the zenite gas has affected you. Captain! The zenite

gas! 

KIRK: The zenite gas. 

MCCOY: Look out, Jim! 

(Plasus attacks, and Kirk knocks him out) 

KIRK: Well, it seems my little demonstration was quite a success.

[Council gallery]

DROXINE: I don't like filters, or even masks. I

like the word protector much better, don't you? 

SPOCK: It is less technical, therefore less accurate, but perhaps more

generally descriptive of the function. 

PLASUS: It appears you have what you came for after all. 

VANNA: The captain will have his zenite, just as I agreed. 

PLASUS: Agreed? There's no such word in the Troglyte vocabulary. 

VANNA: The captain will have his zenite. 

PLASUS: No thanks to any agreement by you. It had to be obtained by

force. 

VANNA: Because it is the only way we can obtain what is due us. 

PLASUS: How about your education? Was that by force? 

VANNA: It served your purpose at the time. 

PLASUS: You could have had those filters for all the good it will do

you. 

KIRK: They will be very effective. sir. They've been severely tested,

and the Troglytes will no longer suffer from retardation and emotional

difficulties. 

PLASUS: They will all be like her. ungrateful, vindictive. 

VANNA: Yes. Our demands have just begun. Here is the zenite, Captain,

just as I promised. 

(Sentinels pile the containers on the balcony) 

KIRK: Thank you, Vanna. 

DROXINE: Stratos is so pleasant and so beautiful. I think I'm afraid to

leave it. 

SPOCK: There is great beauty in the knowledge that lies below, and only

one way to really experience it. 

DROXINE: I shall go to the mines. I no longer wish to be limited to the

clouds. Is your planet like this one? 

SPOCK: No. No, Vulcan is quite different. 

DROXINE: Someday I should like to visit it. 

KIRK: Perhaps some form of mediation can be helpful in your

difficulties. The Federation Bureau of Industrialisation may be of aid

to you. 

PLASUS: I will tolerate absolutely no interference! You will not set

foot here as long as I rule! 

KIRK: Believe me, sir, I have neither the time nor the desire to return

here. Only answering your charges against me will force me back. 

PLASUS: And I shall press them. You are guilty of abduction, Captain! 

KIRK: You're guilty of attacking a starship commander and plotting

against his life. 

VANNA: Captain, perhaps both incidents are best forgotten. 

KIRK: Yes, Vanna. They never happened. Mister Advisor? (Plasus nods)

Mister Spock, let's get that zenite delivered. I believe we only have

three hours left. 

SPOCK: Two hours, fifty-nine minutes to be exact, Captain. 

KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott beam us up.

The

Savage Curtain

Stardate:

5906.4

Original Airdate: 7 Mar, 1969

  [Bridge]

 SULU: All observation stations, take final

readings. This'll be our last orbit. 

KIRK: Spock, any answers? 

SPOCK: I still read a suggestion of carbon cycle life forms on the

planet surface, Captain. 

KIRK: Which is scientifically impossible under conditions there. 

SPOCK: Agreed. Mister Sulu, switch to the planet area I have under

observation. 

SULU: I'm reading it now, Mister Spock. It seems to indicate artificial

power being generated in factor seven quantities. 

SPOCK: Which would indicate a considerable civilisation there. 

MCCOY: What's all this poppycock about life forms on this planet,

Spock? The surface is molten lava. The atmosphere is poisonous. 

SPOCK: Our readings could be false, Captain, perhaps caused by some

natural phenomena. 

MCCOY: Well I think Starfleet should forget about those old space

legends. There's no intelligent life here. 

KIRK: Lieutenant, anything from the planet? 

UHURA: I've repeatedly tried on every hailing frequency, sir. There's

no response on any channel. 

KIRK: Transmit to Starfleet our sensor readings and log entries on the

planet. Surface conditions make it impossible for us to beam down and

investigate further. We are therefore going on to our next assignment. 

UHURA: Aye, aye, sir. 

SULU: Completing final orbit, sir. 

KIRK: Prepare to warp us out. 

(The red light on the navigation console flashes, and the lights dim) 

KIRK: Alert status. 

SPOCK: We're being scanned, Captain. A deep probe, incredibly swift. 

(The lights come back up, and the planet disappears from the

viewscreen) 

MCCOY: Jim! 

(On the screen is the image of a man sitting in a large leather chair,

and wearing a stove-pipe hat) 

LINCOLN [on viewscreen]: Captain Kirk, I believe. A pleasure to make

your acquaintance, sir. 

KIRK: Uhura 

LINCOLN [on viewscreen]: No need to check your voice telegraph device.

Do I gather that you recognise me? 

KIRK: I recognise what you appear to be. 

LINCOLN [on viewscreen]: And appearances can be most deceiving, but not

in this case, James Kirk. I am Abraham Lincoln. 

KIRK: Spock. 

SPOCK: Fascinating. 

LINCOLN [on viewscreen]: I have been described in many ways, Mister

Spock, but never with that word. 

KIRK: I was requesting your analysis, Spock. 

SPOCK: They did scan us and our vessel, Captain, and doubtless obtained

sufficient information to present this illusion. 

LINCOLN [on viewscreen]: Illusion? Captain, will you permit me to come

aboard your vessel? No doubt you have devices which can check my

reality. 

KIRK: We'd be honoured to have you aboard, Mister President. 

LINCOLN [on viewscreen]: Do you still measure time in minutes? 

KIRK: We can convert to it, sir. 

LINCOLN [on viewscreen]: Then you should be directly over my position

in. There. Exactly twelve and one half minutes. Until then, Captain. 

(And the orange planet is back in view) 

KIRK: (signing a PADD) Thank you, Mister Mulney. 

SPOCK: Small change occurring there, Captain. 

KIRK: Magnification four, helm. 

SULU: Aye, aye, sir. 

SPOCK: An area of approximately one thousand square kilometres. It

measures completely Earth-like. 

SULU: Perfect oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. 

CHEKOV: He called it to the second, sir. We'll be over it in exactly

twelve minutes now. 

KIRK: Security, send a detachment to the transporter room immediately,

phaser side arms, and be prepared to give presidential honours. 

MCCOY: Jim, do you really believe he's Abraham Lincoln? 

KIRK: It's obvious he believes it. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock, full

dress uniforms.

[Transporter room]

(Scott is in kilt and plaid, the three security

guards look smart) 

SCOTT: Full dress? Presidential honours? What is this nonsense, Mister

Dickerson? 

DICKERSON: I understand President Lincoln's coming aboard, sir. 

SCOTT: Ha! You're daft, man. 

DICKERSON: All I know is what the captain tells me, and he says he'll

have the hide of the first man that so much as smiles. 

(McCoy enters) 

SCOTT: I'd have expected sanity from the ship's surgeon, at least.

President Lincoln, indeed. No doubt to be followed by Louis of France

and Robert the Bruce. 

(Kirk and Spock enter) 

KIRK: If so, we'll execute appropriate honours to each, Mister Scott. 

SCOTT: Aye, sir. 

KIRK: Gentlemen, I don't for a moment believe that President Lincoln is

actually coming aboard, but we're dealing with an unknown and

apparently highly advanced life-form. Until we know, when in Rome,

we'll do as the Romans do. 

CHEKOV [OC]: Bridge to Transporter room. One minute to overhead

position. 

SCOTT: Locked on to something. Does that appear human to you, Mister

Spock? 

SPOCK: Fascinating. For a moment, it appeared almost mineral. Like

living rock with heavy fore claws. Itâs settling down now to completely

human readings. 

SCOTT: We can beam it aboard anytime now, sir. 

KIRK: Doctor McCoy, take tricorder readings and see if it is human.

Appropriate ruffles and flourishes, Mister Spock. Security, stand

ready. 

DICKERSON: Phaser team, set ready for a heavy stun. 

SPOCK: Band honours ready, Captain. 

KIRK: Energise. 

(A tall, lean figure in a black frock coat is beamed aboard to drum

beat and a bosun's whistle) 

KIRK: The USS Enterprise is honoured to have you aboard, Mister

President. 

LINCOLN: Strange. Where are the musicians? 

KIRK: That's taped music, sir. A starship on active duty never carries

an honour detachment. 

LINCOLN: Taped music, you say. Well, perhaps Mister Spock will be good

enough to explain that to me later. A most interesting way to come

aboard, Captain. What was the device used? 

KIRK: An energy-matter scrambler, sir. The molecules in your body are

converted into energy, then beamed into this chamber and reconverted

back into their original pattern. 

LINCOLN: Well, since I'm obviously here, and quite whole, whatever you

mean apparently works very well indeed. Gentlemen, if those are

weapons, please lower them. At my age, I'm afraid I'm not very

dangerous. 

MCCOY: Human, Jim. 

LINCOLN: All too human, Doctor McCoy. Happy to make your acquaintance. 

KIRK: Mister President, may I present my officers. Commander Spock,

second in command, Engineering Officer Scott and Security Officer

Dickerson. 

LINCOLN: Mister Spock, Mister Scott, Mister Dickerson. Gentlemen, I

hope to talk to each of you. But meanwhile, your captain is consumed

with questions and I shall do my utmost to answer them.

And I trust your duties will permit time to answer some of mine. At

your service, Captain. 

KIRK: Lieutenant Dickerson, you and your men may return to quarters.

Mister President. 

LINCOLN: A most interesting vessel. 

(Kirk, Lincoln, Spock and security leave) 

MCCOY: Just what was it you locked onto before you beamed him aboard? 

SCOTT: You heard Mister Spock yourself. Mineral he called it, like

living rock. 

MCCOY: And that became Lincoln? 

SCOTT: I couldn't tell. It may have been another figure down there

standing by. What do you make of it? 

MCCOY: I'm not quite sure.

Captain's log, stardate 5906.4. Who or what has

been beamed aboard our vessel? An alien who has changed himself into

this form? An illusion? I cannot conceive it possible that Abraham

Lincoln could have actually been reincarnated. And yet his kindness,

his gentle wisdom, his humour, everything about him is so right.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Yes, if I recall, your Union Army observation

balloons were tendered six hundred or so feet high. We're six hundred

and forty three miles above the surface of this planet. 

LINCOLN: You can measure great distances that closely? 

SPOCK: We do, sir. Six hundred forty three miles, two thousand twenty

one feet, two point zero four inches at this moment, using your

old-style measurements. 

LINCOLN: Bless me. 

UHURA: Excuse me, Captain Kirk. 

KIRK: Yes, Lieutenant. 

UHURA: Mister Scott 

LINCOLN: What a charming negress. Oh, forgive me, my dear. I know in my

time some used that term as a description of property. 

UHURA: But why should I object to that term, sir? You see, in our

century we've learned not to fear words. 

KIRK: May I present our communications officer, Lieutenant Uhura. 

LINCOLN: The foolishness of my century had me apologising where no

offense was given. 

KIRK: We've each learned to be delighted with what we are. The Vulcans

learned that centuries before we did. 

SPOCK: It is basic to the Vulcan philosophy, sir. The combination of a

number of things to make existence worthwhile. 

LINCOLN: Yes. Philosophy of Nome, meaning all. How did I know that?

Just as I seem to know that on the planet surface you will meet one of

the greatest living Vulcans in all the long history of your planet. My

mind cannot recall his name, but I know he will be there. What is it

that powers your vessel, Captain? May I see your engine room? 

KIRK: Certainly. Our engineering officer 

UHURA: Has been waiting in the briefing room for you, sir, for over two

hours. 

KIRK: Oh, dear. If youâll forgive me, our communications officer 

LINCOLN: I would be delighted to have her as guide. 

KIRK: Forgive me again. We'll rejoin you shortly.

[Briefing room]

MCCOY: Where the devil are they? 

SCOTT: Why, they're probably looking up a plate of haggis in the

galley. They've been everywhere else. 

(Kirk and Spock enter) 

KIRK: Sorry to have been delayed, gentlemen. 

MCCOY: Jim, I would be the last to advise you on your command image. 

KIRK: I doubt that, Bones, but continue. 

MCCOY: Do I have to lay it out for you? Practically the entire crew has

seen you treat this impostor like the real thing when he canât possibly

be the real article. 

SCOTT: Lincoln died three centuries ago on a planet hundreds of light

years away. 

SPOCK: More that direction, Engineer. 

MCCOY: You're the science officer. Why aren't you, well, doing whatever

a science officer does at a time like this? 

SPOCK: I am, Doctor. I am observing the alien. 

MCCOY: At last! At least somebody agrees with us he's an alien. 

KIRK: Yes, of course he's an alien. 

MCCOY And he's potentially dangerous. 

SCOTT: Mad. Loony as an Arcturian dogbird. 

KIRK: Gentlemen, as you know, Mister Spock and I have been invited to

beam down to the planet surface with him. Any comments on that? 

MCCOY: Yes, a big one. Suddenly, miraculously, we see a small spot of

Earth-type environment down there. Now is it really there, or do we

just think we see it down there? 

SCOTT: You might beam down into a sea of molten lava. 

KIRK: But why would he want to kill only two of us? 

SPOCK: It would be illogical. With such abilities, they could as easily

trick us into destroying the entire vessel. 

MCCOY: Are you implying, Mister Spock, that it's probably safe to beam

down there? 

SPOCK: No, I'm not, Doctor. There's no doubt they want us down there

for some hidden purpose. Otherwise, they would have revealed some

logical reason for all of this. 

KIRK: Why Lincoln, Spock? Any speculation on that? 

SPOCK: Speculation is unnecessary, Captain. The answer is clear.

President Lincoln has always been a very personal hero to you. What

better way to titillate your curiosity than to make him come alive for

you. 

KIRK: But not only to me, Spock. 

SPOCK: Agreed. I, too, experienced his charm. It is a magnificent work

of duplication. 

MCCOY: But he holds a special involvement to you, Jim. I think it's

interesting, in as much as you're the one who's going to make the

decision whether to beam down or not. 

SCOTT: Don't do it, Captain. 

KIRK: The very reason for the existence of our starships is contact

with other life. Although the method is beyond our comprehension, we

have been offered contact. Therefore, I shall beam down. Mister Spock,

as for you 

SPOCK: Captain, since I was included in the invitation to make contact,

I must beam down with you. 

MCCOY: You're both out of your heads! 

SCOTT: Aye, sir. 

KIRK: And you're on the edge of insubordination. 

MCCOY: Would I be on the edge of insubordination to remind the captain

that this smells of something happening to him that I might not be able

to patch together again? 

SCOTT: Aye! 

KIRK: Gentlemen, your concern is noted and appreciated. Mister Spock,

standard dress, tricorders and phasers. We will guide President Lincoln

to the transporter room. We'll beam down immediately.

[Transporter room]

KIRK: Standing by, Mister Scott. 

SCOTT: Transporter room to bridge. Standing by. 

CHEKOV [OC]: We are now locked in synchronous orbit, Mister Scott.

Sensors continue to show the area as completely Earth-like in all

respects. 

MCCOY: If theyâre wrong and they do beam into a pool of lava 

SCOTT: Then they're dead men. I couldna pull them back in time. 

KIRK: All right, Mister Scott, energise. 

(Lincoln, Kirk and Spock are beamed away, but - ) 

MCCOY: Scotty.

[Planet surface]

(Sandy ground, big rocks, orange sky) 

SPOCK: Captain. Our phasers and tricorders did not beam down with us. 

KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise? Enterprise, come in. Kirk to

Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. 

SPOCK: Undamaged, yet something is preventing them from functioning.

[Transporter room]

SCOTT: Come in, landing party. Report. Enterprise

to Captain Kirk. Can you read us? 

MCCOY: If theyâre all right, they should've reported in.

[Planet surface]

KIRK: Your explanation, sir? 

LINCOLN: Well, I have none. To me this seems quite as it should be. 

KIRK: Why were our weapons taken? Why can't we communicate with our

ship? 

LINCOLN: Please, believe me. I know nothing other than what I have

already told you. 

KIRK: The game is over. We've treated you with courtesy. We've gone

along with what and who you think you are. 

LINCOLN: Despite the seeming contradictions, all is as it appears to

be. I am Abraham Lincoln. 

SURAK: Just as I am whom I appear to be. 

SPOCK: Surak. 

KIRK: Who? 

SPOCK: The greatest of all who ever lived on our planet, Captain. The

father of all we became.

[Bridge]

SULU: (in the captain's chair) All ship's systems

going dead. Switch to reserve power. All decks report status. 

UHURA: All decks report status. All decks report status. 

SULU: Bridge to Engineering. Come in. What's happening to our power?

Bridge to Engineering, report. 

ENGINEER [OC]: Everything's out. We've switched to reserve power. Lost

all power in the warp engines. 

(Scott and McCoy enter) 

SCOTT: How is it, Mister Sulu? 

SULU: No answer yet on what caused it. They're standing by. 

SCOTT: Shut down all but the most necessary systems. 

UHURA: No damage report, Mister Scott. 

ENGINEER [OC]: No indication of engine damage, sir. 

SCOTT: Engage restart cycle. 

ENGINEER [OC]: I can't. I don't understand it. 

SCOTT: Start emergency procedures. 

ENGINEER [OC]: Aye, aye, sir.

[Planet surface]

SURAK: Live long and prosper, Spock. May you also,

Captain Kirk. 

SPOCK: It is not logical that you are Surak. There is no fact,

extrapolation of fact or theory, which would make possible. 

SURAK: Whatever I am, would it harm you to give response? 

SPOCK: Live long and prosper, image of Surak, father of all we now hold

true. 

SURAK: The image of Surak read in your face what is in your mind,

Spock. 

SPOCK: As I turned and my eyes beheld you, I displayed emotion. I beg

forgiveness. 

SURAK: The cause was more than sufficient. Let us speak no further of

it. In my time, we knew not of Earth men. I am pleased to see that we

have differences. May we together become greater than the sum of both

of us. 

KIRK: Spock, we'll not go along with these charades any longer. 

(A rock changes into a creature with heavy fore-claws) 

ROCK: You'll have an answer soon, Captain. Our world is called

Excalbia. Countless who live on that planet are watching.

Before this drama unfolds, we give welcome to the ones named Kirk and

Spock. 

KIRK: We know nothing of your world or your customs. What do you mean,

drama about to unfold? 

ROCK: You're intelligent life form, but I'm surprised you do not

perceive the honour we do you. Have we not created in this place on our

planet a stage identical to your own world? 

KIRK: We perceive we were invited to come here, and we came in

friendship. And you have deprived us of our instruments to examine your

world, to defend ourselves, to communicate with our vessel. 

ROCK: Your objection is well taken. We shall communicate with your

vessel so your fellow life forms may also enjoy and profit from the

play. Behold. 

(More people arrive. A human, a Mongol, an alien woman and a Klingon) 

ROCK: Captain, Mister Spock, some of these you may know through

history. Genghis Khan, for one. And Colonel Green, who led a genocidal

war early in the 21st century on Earth. Zora, who experimented with the

body chemistry of subject tribes on Tiburon.

Kahless the Unforgettable, the Klingon who set the pattern for his

planet's tyrannies. We welcome the vessel Enterprise

[Bridge]

ROCK [on viewscreen]: To our solar system and to

our spectacle. 

MCCOY: At least the captain and Spock are safe. 

SCOTT: It's a confrontation of some sort. Those are all figures out of

history. Notoriously evil. 

ROCK [on viewscreen]: We ask you to observe with us

[Planet surface]

ROCK: The confrontation of the two opposing

philosophies you term good and evil. Since this is our first experiment

with Earthlings, our theme is a simple one. Survival, life and death.

Your philosophies are alien to us, and we wish to understand them and

discover which is the stronger. We learn by observing such spectacles. 

KIRK: What do you mean, survival? 

ROCK: The word is explicit. If you and Spock survive, you return to

your vessel. If you do not, your existence is ended.

[Bridge]

MCCOY: Can we beam the captain and Spock back up? 

SCOTT: We don't have the power. They'll come aboard a mass of dying

flesh. 

MCCOY: Well, can we send the phasers down? 

SCOTT: There's nothing we can do, Doctor. Nothing but watch them. He's

skimmed the worst ones in history to face them. 

MCCOY: But they're not real, any more than that Lincoln or Surak. What

do the sensors read? 

CHEKOV: As life-forms. They are living beings. 

MCCOY: Could they be aliens projecting an illusion? 

CHEKOV: The readings are those of humanoids. 

ROCK [on viewscreen]: Why do you hesitate?

[Planet surface]

ROCK: Do you wish further clarification? Your

choice of action is unlimited, as is your choice of weapons. Should you

wish to use any, you may fabricate anything you desire out of what you

can find around you. Captain? 

KIRK: Mister Spock and I refuse to participate. 

ROCK: You will decide otherwise. 

(And changes back into a real lump of rock) 

KIRK: Analysis, Spock. Why do they want us to fight? 

SPOCK: It may be exactly as explained, Captain. Our concept of good and

evil is strange to them. Perhaps they wish to determine which is

strongest. 

KIRK: And they'll get their answers if it kills us. 

LINCOLN: I'm afraid none of us may leave, gentlemen, until we do what

it demands of us. 

GREEN: Captain Kirk, may I speak with you? I quite agree with your

attitude toward this charade. It's ridiculous to think that we should

take part in it. 

KIRK: What do you want? 

GREEN: The same thing as you do, to get out of here. I have no quarrel

with you any more than you have with me. 

KIRK: You're somewhat different than the way history paints you,

Colonel Green. 

GREEN: History tends to exaggerate. I suggest we call a halt to this at

once and see if we can't find some way out of our difficulties. My

associates are in full agreement with me. Captain, you were tricked

into coming here, weren't you? So were we all. 

KIRK: Where do you come from? 

GREEN: I can't remember. Isn't that strange? My memory used to be quite

remarkable. Well, wherever it was, I want to get back. So it seems to

me, Captain, that we have a common cause, and our enemy is that

creature. 

KIRK: What do you propose?

[Bridge]

GREEN [on viewscreen]: That we combine forces, and

reason some way to overcome it. 

KIRK [on viewscreen]: You were notorious, Colonel Green, for striking

at your enemies in the midst of negotiating with them. 

GREEN [on viewscreen]: But that was centuries ago, Captain, and not

altogether true. No, there is much I would change now if I could. Don't

let prejudice and rumour sway you. 

(Meanwhile, the other three baddies split up and start to circle

around) 

SULU: Captain! How can we warn him? 

(Khan throws a rock at Spock, and a fight starts until the bad guys run

off)

[Planet surface]

KIRK: Anyone hurt? 

LINCOLN: I fear my clothing is somewhat damaged, but how delightful to

discover at my age that I can still wrestle. 

KIRK: Mister Spock? 

SPOCK: I'm all right, Captain. However, I suggest that we prepare

ourselves for another attack. 

KIRK: No, I think Colonel Green is right. That rock-like thing is our

enemy, not those illusions. 

LINCOLN: For an illusion, my opponent carried a considerable punch. Oh,

I forgot. You consider me an illusion too. 

SURAK: The captain speaks wisely. Those four are not our enemy. We

should arrive together at a peaceful settlement. 

ROCK: I am disappointed. You display no interest in the honour we do

you. We offer you an opportunity to become our teachers by

demonstrating whether good or evil is more powerful. You find my body

heat distressing, Captain? You forget the nature of this planet. I must

conclude that your species requires a cause to fight for. You may now

communicate with your ship. 

KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in.

[Engineering]

SCOTT [OC]: Scott to Engineering. Report,

Lieutenant. 

ENGINEER: Emergency increasing, sir.

[Bridge]

ENGINEER [OC]: Deterioration has just started, sir.



SCOTT: Give me that again, man. I cannot hear you. 

UHURA: Mister Scott, I have the captain.

[Planet surface]

KIRK: Scotty, do you read me?

[Bridge]

UHURA: Mister Scott, I have the captain. 

SCOTT: Engineering, check for radiation. Get a repair crew on it at

once. 

ENGINEER [OC]: We have already, sir. We can't seem to stop it. 

SCOTT: Is there a danger of detonation? 

ENGINEER [OC]: Estimating four hours, sir. 

UHURA: Red Alert, Captain. Mister Scott is standing by. 

KIRK [OC]: What caused the red alert? 

UHURA: I don't know yet, sir. 

SCOTT: Captain.

[Planet surface]

KIRK: Scotty, beam us up fast.

[Bridge]

SCOTT: I cannot. We have a complete power failure.

[Planet surface]

SCOTT [OC]: We're on emergency battery power only. 

KIRK: What happened?

[Bridge]

SCOTT: I can't explain it, sir, but the matter and

antimatter are in red zone proximity. 

KIRK [OC]: What caused that? 

SCOTT: There's no knowing and there's no stopping it either. The

shielding is breaking down. I estimate four hours before it goes

completely. Four hours before the ship blows up.

[Planet surface]

ROCK: The estimate is quite correct. Your ship will

blow itself to bits within four hours, Captain, unless you defeat the

others before then. Is that cause enough to fight for? 

KIRK: What if they defeat us?

[Bridge]

ROCK [on viewscreen]: To save your ship and your

crew, you have to win.

[Planet surface]

KIRK: Scotty, inform Starfleet Command. Disengage

nacelles, Jettison if possible. Mister Spock, assist them. Advise and

analyse. Scotty? Scotty? 

ROCK: Your communicators no longer function, Captain. You may proceed

with the spectacle. 

LINCOLN: James, the war is forced upon us. History repeats itself.

Supplemental Log, stardate 5906.5. Engineer Scott

reporting. The Enterprise is doomed to explode in two hours

if Captain Kirk is defeated by the enemy on the surface of the planet.

The enormous power of the Enterprise has been neutralised and we sit

here watching, unable to assist.

[Bad man base]

GREEN: Did you set the traps? 

KAHLESS: Yes. 

GREEN: What did you find out? What are they doing? 

KAHLESS: They've done nothing. They've not armed themselves nor

prepared for any kind of defence. I say attack now and finish them. 

GREEN: With what? These? (pointed sticks) 

KAHLESS: Better than what they have. 

GREEN: No, it's not advantage enough. I want to make sure the odds are

in our favour. Overwhelm and devastate, that's the way to get power and

to hold it, and I mean to do that.

[Good guy base]

KIRK: There's nothing immoral about fighting an

illusion, Mister Spock. We play their game, fight, or lose the ship and

all the crewmen aboard. 

SPOCK: And if theyâre real, Captain? 

KIRK: We'll use this as a base. It's defensible. They can't approach

without being seen. 

LINCOLN: Are we fighting a defensive war, James? 

KIRK: No, we don't have time. But if things go against us, I want a

place to retreat to. What I want to do now is scout them out, find

their weaknesses and attack. 

LINCOLN: Do you drink whiskey? 

KIRK: Occasionally. Why? 

LINCOLN: Because you have qualities very much like those of another man

I admire greatly. General Grant. 

KIRK: Thank you. Thank you. Mister Spock, we'll need weapons. I believe

the ancient Vulcans made something like a boomerang? 

SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 

KIRK: And slings and spears. Slings. Mister President. You used a sling

as a boy. 

LINCOLN: Indeed I did. 

SPOCK: Captain. Logic dictates that we consider another course. 

KIRK: We don't have much time, Spock. 

SURAK: In my time on Vulcan, we also faced these same alternatives.

We'd suffered devastating wars which nearly destroyed our planet.

Another was about to begin. We were torn. But out of our suffering some

of us found the discipline to act. We sent emissaries to our opponents

to propose peace. The first were killed, but others followed.

Ultimately we achieved peace, which has lasted since then. 

KIRK: Circumstances were different then, Surak. 

SURAK: The face of war has never changed, Captain. Surely it is more

logical to heal than kill. 

KIRK: I'm afraid that kind of logic doesn't apply here. 

SURAK: That is precisely why we should not fight. 

KIRK: My ship is at stake. 

SURAK: I will not harm others, Captain. 

SPOCK: His convictions are most profound in this matter, Captain. 

KIRK: So are mine, Spock. If I believed that there was a peaceful way

out of this 

SURAK: The risk will be mine alone. If I fail, you lose nothing. After

all, I'm no warrior. 

SPOCK: The captain knows that I have fought at his side before and will

do so now, if need be. However, I too, am a Vulcan, bred to peace. Let

him attempt it. 

KIRK: You saw how treacherously they acted. 

SURAK: Oh, yes. But perhaps it's our belief in peace that is actually

being tested. 

KIRK: I have no authority over you. You may do as you think best. 

SURAK: Thank you. May you live long and prosper. 

KIRK: The weapons, gentlemen. In case he fails.

[Bad guy base]

KAHLESS: Colonel! 

(They watch Surak approach. Zora makes to throw a spear) 

GREEN: No. Let's hear what he has to say. We may find it useful. Stop

there, Vulcan. State your purpose. 

SURAK: I come in peace to propose peace. 

GREEN: Are you surrendering? 

SURAK I'm doing what I consider best for all of us. If you choose to

regard that as surrender, I accept your definition.

KAHLESS: One of those peace lovers, Colonel. 

GREEN: Why are you doing this? Do you speak for the others? 

SURAK: No, I speak for myself because I abhor violence. But if you

accept the solution I offer, they, too, will accept it.

[Bridge]

GREEN [on viewscreen]: How can I be sure? I think

youâre trying to trick me, Vulcan. I think that while you're here

talking peace, the others are preparing to attack. 

SURAK [on viewscreen]: No, Colonel. They are at their base awaiting an

answer.

[Bad guy base]

GREEN: How can I believe that? No one talks peace

unless he's ready to back it up with war. 

SURAK: He talks peace if it is the only way to live. 

GREEN: Then tell me, what do you have to gain if we accept? 

SURAK: Nothing but the knowledge that I have done what I believe in. 

GREEN: What do I get out of it? I fight for gain, Vulcan. What do I

gain here? 

SURAK: Your life and the lives of the others. You said yourself,

Colonel, that we have common cause to survive. Together we can. But not

by warring. 

KAHLESS: Why don't we kill him? 

GREEN: No. He's our means to finish them all. 

(Kahless and Khan circle around) 

SURAK: Colonel, surely you accept the logic of this. What is your

answer? 

GREEN: You're very persuasive, Vulcan. I'd like to come out of this

with a whole skin. Perhaps I can convince my associates that it would

be to their advantage also.

[Good guy base]

(Kirk, Spock and Lincoln are also sharpening sticks

as spears) 

KIRK: Your Surak is a brave man. 

SURAK: Men of peace usually are, Captain. On Vulcan, he is revered as

the father of our civilisation. The father image holds much meaning for

us. 

KIRK: You show emotion, Spock. 

SPOCK: I deeply respect what he has accomplished. 

KIRK: I hope he accomplishes something here, and soon. 

(A scream rings out)

KIRK: Surak? 

SURAK [OC]: Help me, Spock! Spock, help me! 

GREEN [OC]: Mister Spock, your friend wants you. He seems to be hurt. 

SURAK [OC]: Spock! Help me, Spock! Spock! Help me! 

GREEN [OC]: You can't let him suffer. 

SPOCK: They're trying to goad us into attacking, Captain. They expect

us to act rashly. 

KIRK: Yes, I know that. 

SURAK [OC]: Help me, Spock! 

SPOCK: He was aware of what might happen when he went. 

KIRK: I should never have let him go. 

SPOCK: You had no choice, Captain. You could not have stopped him. 

KIRK: How can you ignore that? 

SPOCK: A Vulcan would not cry out so. 

KIRK: Whether he's a Vulcan or not, he's in agony. 

SPOCK: I am not insensitive to it, Captain. 

SURAK [OC]: Help me, Spock! 

KIRK: But you can just listen to it and do nothing. I can't. 

SPOCK: Captain, that is what they are waiting for. They're waiting for

us to attempt a rescue. 

KIRK: I canât just let him stay there. 

LINCOLN: Perhaps we can rescue him, Mister Spock. Now, I suggest that

we do whatever they want. 

KIRK: Do what they want, sir? 

LINCOLN: Not the way they want it, however. We must first convince them

that they have provoked us to recklessness. James, I do not mean to

presume upon your authority. What I propose is that I circle around to

their rear while you two provide a frontal assault. It should be

sufficiently violent to cover whatever I do. 

KIRK: And what will you do? 

LINCOLN: Why, slip into their camp and free him. 

KIRK: No. 

LINCOLN: James, James. Remember, I was something of a backwoodsman. I

doubt that you could do what I was bred to. 

KIRK: I can't let you risk it, Mister President. 

LINCOLN: I am no longer president. Mister Spock, any comment? 

SURAK [OC]: Help me, Spock! 

SPOCK: No, sir. 

LINCOLN: One matter further, gentlemen. We fight on their level. With

trickery, brutality, finality. We match their evil.

I know, James. I was reputed to be a gentle man. But I was commander in

chief during the four bloodiest years of my country's history. I gave

orders that sent a hundred thousand men to their death at the hands of

their brothers. There is no honourable way to kill, no gentle way to

destroy. There is nothing good in war except its ending. And you are

fighting for the lives of your crew. 

KIRK: Your campaign, Mister President.

[Bad guy base]

GREEN: They should be coming soon. 

(Green and Khan see Kirk and Spock duck down behind a large rock,

carrying a lot of spears) 

GREEN: Zora! Kahless! No, wait! 

(Spock throws the first spear) 

GREEN: How many do you see? 

KAHLESS: Two. 

GREEN: Zora. 

(She goes to circle around. Khan and Kirk throw rocks at each other.

Meanwhile, a very stealthy Lincoln has found Surak.) 

LINCOLN: Surak. 

(Green and Kahless arrive) 

LINCOLN: Surak, the others have drawn them away. We will circle around.

It was a worthy effort, Surak. Worthy. No need to blame yourself before

its failure. 

(But once untied, Surak is revealed to be dead.) 

KAHLESS: (as Surak) Help me, Spock. Help me, Spock. 

GREEN: Now can you cry like Lincoln? 

KAHLESS: (as Lincoln) Help me, Kirk. Help me, Kirk! 

(Lincoln walks towards Kirk and Spock) 

KIRK: Mister Lincoln! 

LINCOLN: James, stay back. 

(Lincoln finally topples forward, a big spear in his back. Now the

close fighting begins, with Green letting his 'associates' do the hard

work. Zora runs off. Kirk deals with Kahless and helps Spock with Khan.

The bad guys retreat. Kirk chases and catches Green who ends up falling

on his own dagger.) 

ROCK: You are the survivors. The others have run off. It would seem

that evil retreats when forcibly confronted. However, you have failed

to demonstrate to me any other difference between your philosophies.

Your good and your evil use the same methods, achieve the same results.

Do you have an explanation? 

KIRK: You established the methods and the goals. 

ROCK: For you to use as you chose. 

KIRK: What did you offer the others if they won? 

ROCK: What they wanted most. Power. 

KIRK: You offered me the lives of my crew. 

ROCK: I perceive you have won their lives. 

KIRK: How many others have you done this to? What gives you the right

to hand out life and death? 

ROCK: The same right that brought you here. The need to know new

things. 

KIRK: We came in peace. 

ROCK: And you may go in peace. 

KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. 

SULU [OC]: Is that you, Captain? Are you all right? 

KIRK: Yes, Mister Sulu. We're all right. You may beam us aboard.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Mister Scott, report. 

SCOTT: The ship is functioning normally again, sir, and the restart

cycle is in operation. You'd never know anything had been out of order.

I can't fathom it. 

KIRK: Mister Sulu. 

SULU: We should be on warp power within thirty minutes, sir. 

KIRK: Good. Mister Chekov. 

CHEKOV: The deterioration in the shielding has stopped and is reversing

itself. I have no explanation. 

KIRK: Thank you, Mister Chekov. Mister Spock, any explanation? 

SPOCK: Conjecture, Captain, rather than explanation. 

KIRK: Well? 

SPOCK: It would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able

to control matter and to rearrange molecules in whatever fashion was

desired. So they were able to create images of Surak and Lincoln after

scanning our minds and using their fellow creatures as source matter. 

KIRK: They seemed so real. And to me, especially Mister Lincoln. I feel

I actually met Lincoln. 

SPOCK: Yes, and Surak. Perhaps in a sense they were real, Captain.

Since they were created out of our own thoughts, how could they be

anything but what we expected them to be? 

KIRK: It was so hard for me to see him die again. I feel I understand

what Earth must have gone through to achieve final peace. 

UHURA: Captain Kirk, the planet has resumed its normal appearance. 

KIRK: There's still so much of their work to be done in the galaxy,

Spock. Mister Sulu, break us out of orbit and continue to our next

assignment. 

SULU: Aye, aye, sir.

Stardate:

5943.7

Original Airdate: 14 Mar, 1969

 

Captain's log, Stardate 5943.7. We have calculated that Beta Niobe will

go nova in approximately three and a half hours.

Its only satellite, Sarpeidon, is a Class M planet, which at last

report was inhabited by a civilised humanoid species.

Now our instruments show that no intelligent life remains on the

planet.

[Library]

(Kirk, McCoy and Spock have beamed down) 

SPOCK: The power source we detected is in this building, Captain. 

KIRK: Any sign of survivors? 

SPOCK: No signs of sapient life forms. 

MCCOY: How can a planet full of people just disappear? 

KIRK: If they knew that their sun was dying, it could be anything up to

mass suicide. 

SPOCK: Reports deny that they had any space flight capability. This

appears to be an archive or library of some kind. 

KIRK: Then we're certainly in the right place to find out what

happened, where the inhabitants are, and if there are any left now. 

MCCOY: Well, that's fine. Where do we start? 

ATOZ: May I help you? I am the librarian. May I be of assistance? 

(A silver-haired man, called A to Z - perfect for a librarian) 

KIRK: Perhaps you can, Mister 

ATOZ: Mister Atoz. I confess that I'm a little surprised to see you. I

had thought that everyone had long since gone.

But the surprise is pleasant one. After all, a library serves no

purpose unless someone is using it. 

KIRK: You say everyone is gone? Where'd they go? 

ATOZ: It depended on the individual, of course. If you wish to trace a

specific person, I'm sorry, but that information is confidential. 

MCCOY: No, no particular person, just people in general. Where did they

go? 

ATOZ: Ah, you find it difficult to choose, is that it? Yes, a wide

range of alternatives is a mixed blessing, but perhaps I can help.

Would you step this way, please? 

(They walk away from Atoz, and another one steps in front of them from

between a range of shelves) 

ATOZ: May I help you? You may select from more than twenty thousand

verism tapes, several hundred of which have only recently been added to

the collection. I'm sure you'll find something here that pleases you.

You, sir, what is your particular field of interest? 

KIRK: What about recent history? 

ATOZ: Really? Oh, that's too bad. We have so little on recent history.

There was no demand for it. 

KIRK: It doesn't have to be extensive, Just the answers to a few

questions. 

ATOZ: Of course. Reference services available at the desk. 

(Where another Mr. Atoz is sitting) 

ATOZ: You're very late. Where have you been? 

KIRK: You're a very agile man, Mister Atoz. Just how many of you are

there? We came as soon as we knew what was happening. 

SPOCK: Forgive me, sir. It is my fault. I must have miscalculated. Our

readings indicated that there was no one here at all. 

ATOZ: Of course I know. Everyone on this planet was warned of the

coming nova long ago. They followed instructions and are now safe. And

you had better do the same. 

KIRK: Did you say they were safe? 

ATOZ: Absolutely. Every single one. 

KIRK: Where did they go? 

ATOZ: Wherever they wanted to go, of course. It is strictly up to the

individual's choice. 

KIRK: I see. And you personally sent all these people on the planet to

safety? 

ATOZ: Yes, yes, yes. They are all gone, except you three. Of course, I

had to delegate the simple tasks to my replicas. 

KIRK: You are the real one, Mister Atoz? 

KIRK: Of course. I am the real Mister Atoz. 

MCCOY: As a matter of fact, he's quite real, Jim. 

KIRK: Let us take you with us to a place of safety. 

ATOZ: No, thank you. I plan to join my wife and family when the time

comes. Now, don't be concerned about me. Think of yourselves. I warn

you most urgently. Make your escape before it's too late. The library

is at your complete service.

I will gladly supply you with all reference material to help you.

History of the planet is available in every detail.

Just choose what interests you the most. The millennium, the century,

the date, the moment. The library is your key. (puts a disc in a

reader) Oh! It's in the wrong file. Make your own selection, but

remember, you're very late. 

KIRK: We'll choose it as quick as we can. How long till nova? 

SPOCK: Three hours, thirteen minutes. 

KIRK: This gentleman is not 

ATOZ: You, sir. I think youâll find something interesting over here. 

(He leads Kirk to his desk) 

ATOZ: Now, if these won't do, I can bring you another file. 

(Atoz goes off to a machine, while Kirk puts a disc on the player and

sees a town scene with

horse-drawn carriages and a sedan chair. Spock goes over to Mister

Atoz, leaving McCoy browsing images of a snow-covered waste) 

ATOZ: Have you made your selection, sir? 

SPOCK: Exactly what is it that I'm expected to select? 

ATOZ: I'm sure I was clear. The period in which you're interested. 

SPOCK: I see. This is a fascinating machine. What is it? 

ATOZ: Ah, this is the atavachron. 

SPOCK: Interesting nomenclature. How does it work? May I 

ATOZ: Oh, no, sir, no. I must ask you not to touch the controlling

mechanism. Return and make your selection. When you have chosen, I will

prepare you through the atavachron. 

SPOCK: Thank you, Mister Atoz. 

(Kirk hears a woman scream from behind a doorway)

KIRK: Spock. Bones. 

ATOZ: Wait! I haven't prepared you. 

(Kirk runs through the doorway and disappears. He appears in a street

where people dressed as cavaliers are manhandling a wench) 

ATOZ: You must be prepared! 

(Spock and McCoy go through the doorway)

[Ice Age]

MCCOY: What is this place? 

SPOCK: Yes, and where is the captain?

[17th Century]

WENCH: You dirty thing. Let go of me! 

(She gets spanked with a sword) 

MAN: Vile vixen! 

(Kirk grabs his weapon) 

MAN: Come when you are bidden, slave! (Kirk pushes him down) You need a

lesson in how to use your betters. Who's your master? 

KIRK: I'm a free man, sir. 

MAN 2: Then you want better manners, free man. Defend yourself! 

(So Kirk gets into a proper sword-fight, with foils, and wins. The two

cavaliers run off, and the people laugh)

[Ice Age]

SPOCK: Heating this boulder may provide some

temporary heat. 

MCCOY: What's wrong? 

SPOCK: Something's preventing my phaser from operating.

[17th Century]

WENCH: Oh, thank you, man. I thought I'd be

limbered sure when that gull caught me cutting his purse. 

KIRK: What's that? Are you all right? 

WENCH: Oh, I took you to be an angler, but you're none of us, are ya?

Well, you're a bully fine coe for all of that. What a handsome dish ya

served them, the coxcombs. 

KIRK: You better come back with me to the library. You'll be safe

there. Doctor McCoy can see to those bruises. 

WENCH: I'm game, love. Lead and I'll follow. Where's library? 

KIRK: It's right over there. 

(But all he sees is a blank brick wall)

[Ice Age]

MCCOY: Where's the captain, Spock? We were right

behind him.

[17th Century]

WENCH: What's with you, man? Let's make off before

coxcombs come with shoulder clappers.Â 

KIRK: No. Do you remember when you first saw me? Do you remember

whether I came through some kind of door? 

WENCH: Oh, I think the rum gull must've kicked you in the head. Come

on, love. I know a leech who'll ask no questions. 

KIRK: No. No. It must be here someplace. 

MCCOY [OC]: Jim!

[Ice Age]

MCCOY: Jim, can you hear us?

[17th Century]

KIRK: Bones? Spock?

[Ice Age]

SPOCK: Captain, we hear you, but we cannot see you.

[17th Century]

SPOCK [OC]: Are you all right? 

KIRK: We must've missed each other somehow. 

SPOCK [OC]: Agreed.

[Ice Age]

SPOCK: Apparently they've all escaped the

destruction of their world by retreating into its past.

[17th Century]

WENCH: Mercy on us. It's spirits. 

KIRK: No, no. No, no, no. These are friends of mine, and they're

[Ice Age]

KIRK [OC]: Spock, are you in the library? 

SPOCK: Indeed not. We're in a wilderness of arctic characteristics. 

MCCOY: He means it's cold.

[17th Century]

KIRK: Can you get to the library?

[Ice Age]

SPOCK: There is no library, Captain, at least not

that we can see. We are at the base of an ice cliff.

[17th Century]

KIRK: Explain.

[Ice Age]

SPOCK: Just before you disappeared, Captain, I

discovered a machine which Mister Atoz called the atavachron.

[17th Century]

KIRK: It must have been tied in to the tape viewer

somehow.

[Ice Age]

SPOCK: Opening time portals to the past. You cross

through into the period which you were viewing. 

MCCOY: I was looking over some material about their Ice Age. 

SPOCK: I am here, evidently, because I stepped through at the same

instant as Doctor McCoy.

[17th Century]

KIRK: Yes. (a mob approaches) My friends are coming

back with reinforcements. 

MAN: There's the mort's accomplice. Arrest him. 

LAW: We are the law, and do require that you yield to us. 

KIRK: On what charge? 

LAW: Thievery and purse cutting. 

KIRK: That's a mistake. I'm no thief. 

MCCOY [OC]: Whatâs happening? 

LAW: Lord help us. What's that? 

WENCH: It's spirits. 

LAW: Away. Away, spirit, and let honest men approach. 

KIRK: Keep talking! 

SPOCK [OC]: Captain! 

MAN: They speak at his bidding. Stop his mouth and they'll quiet. 

SPOCK [OC]: You must be close to the portal. 

KIRK Keep talking now! 

(But he is overpowered and dragged away)

[Ice Age]

MCCOY: Jim, what's the matter? Jim sounded like he

was in trouble. 

SPOCK: We may be in trouble ourselves. We must find shelter. 

(They walk on until McCoy collapses) 

SPOCK: In this severe cold, we cannot survive much longer. 

MCCOY: Leave me here, Spock. 

SPOCK: We go together or not at all. 

MCCOY: Don't be a fool. My hands and face are frostbitten. I can't feel

my feet. Alone you have a chance. Now do what I say. Go try to find

Jim. 

SPOCK: We go together. 

MCCOY: You stubborn, thickheaded Vulcan! 

(A figure wearing a full length fur coat with hood approaches, then

turns to walk away. Spock helps McCoy to follow)

[Cave]

(It's quite homely, with the stalagmites and skins

laid down, the lovely smooth floor and handy bed for Spock to put McCoy

down on) 

SPOCK: He's suffering from the severity of your weather. Unfortunately,

he is the doctor, not I. I'll avoid giving him any medication at this

time. Perhaps, if he's kept quiet and warm, he may recover naturally.

It is agreeably warm here. 

(Their benefactor has pushed back the hood to reveal that it is a young

woman) 

ZARABETH: What are you called? 

SPOCK: I'm called Spock. 

ZARABETH: Even your name is strange. Forgive me. I've never seen anyone

who looks like you. Why are you here? Are you prisoners too? 

SPOCK: Prisoners? 

ZARABETH: This is one of the places Zor Kahn sends people when he wants

them to disappear. Didn't you come in through the time portal? 

SPOCK: Yes, we came through the time portal, but not as prisoners. We

were sent here by mistake. 

ZARABETH: The atavachron is far away, but I think you come from

someplace farther than that. 

SPOCK: That is true. I am not from the world you know at all. My home

is a planet millions of light years away. 

ZARABETH: Oh, how wonderful! I've always loved books about such

possibilities. But they are only stories. This isn't real. I must be

imagining all this. I'm going mad! 

SPOCK: Listen to me. I am firmly convinced that I do exist. I am

substantial. You are not imagining this. 

ZARABETH: Oh, I've been here for so long, alone. When I saw you out

there, I couldn't believe it. Is he dying?

[17C Jail]

LAW: Here. There's the mort. And there's the mort's

henchman. 

JUDGE: Open up. Rouse him. 

(The somberly clothed judge sits on a stool opposite Kirk) 

JUDGE: You're the thief who talks to spirits. 

KIRK: I'm a stranger. 

JUDGE: Where are you from? 

KIRK: An island. 

JUDGE: What is this island? 

KIRK: It's called Earth. 

JUDGE: I know no island Earth. No matter. Continue. 

KIRK: I never saw that woman before tonight. When she screamed, as far

as I could tell, she was being attacked. 

JUDGE: Then you deny being her accomplice? 

KIRK: Yes, I deny it. I was reading in the library when I heard her

scream. My lord, the library? Do you remember where the library is, my

lord? 

JUDGE: Perhaps your part in this is innocent. I believe you to be an

honest man. 

WENCH: He's a witch! 

JUDGE: Take care, woman. I am convinced of your guilt. Do not compound

it with false accusation. 

WENCH: He speaks to unseen spirits. He's a witch! You heard the voices!



LAW: It's truth, my lord. I heard the spirit talk to him. He answered

and did call it Bones. 

WENCH: You're a witch. He cast a spell. He made me steal against my

wish. 

KIRK: Surely you don't believe 

JUDGE: You heard these spirits? 

LAW: Aye, my lord. I'll witness to it. 

KIRK: What he heard, my lord, were only my friends behind the wall in

the library. In the library.

JUDGE: I know nothing of this. Send for someone learned in witchcraft

and let him examine him. I will have nothing to do with it. 

KIRK: My lord, at least arrange for me to meet Mister Atoz. 

JUDGE: I know of no Atoz. 

KIRK: Yes! Yes! Atoz! 

JUDGE: I know nothing of this, nothing of these matters! I will not

hear him! 

KIRK: Let me speak to you! 

JUDGE: I will not hear him. 

(Judge and law man leave) 

KIRK: At least let me talk to you! 

WENCH: Witch! Witch! Witch! They'll burn ya.

[Cave]

SPOCK: McCoy. McCoy, wake up. 

MCCOY: Who are you? 

ZARABETH: My name is Zarabeth. 

MCCOY: Zarabeth. Spock, are we in the library? 

SPOCK: No, we are still in the Ice Age, but safe for the moment. 

MCCOY: Jim. What about Jim? 

SPOCK: Doctor, you're in no condition to get up. You lie down and rest.

I shall attempt to find the captain. 

MCCOY: You find him, Spock. Don't you worry about me. You just find

him. 

(Spock and Zarabeth leave him to sleep) 

ZARABETH: Spock, who is this Jim? 

(She removes the fur coat to reveal she is wearing little more than a

leather bikini with boots) 

SPOCK: He's our commanding officer and our friend. 

ZARABETH: I saw only the two of you. I did not know there was another. 

SPOCK: He did not come with us. He was sent through the time portal to

another period in history much later than this one. If I am to find

him, there is only one possible avenue. Zarabeth, will you show me

where the time portal is? 

ZARABETH: But your friend. He is ill. 

SPOCK: Yes, that is true. If I leave him, there's a chance he may never

regain the ship. He would then be marooned in this time period. But he

is no longer in danger of death, so my primary duty to him has been

discharged. If I remain here, no one of our party would be able to aid

Captain Kirk. 

ZARABETH: You make it sound like an equation. 

SPOCK: It should be an equation. I should be able to resolve this

problem logically. Perhaps it has something to do with the atavachron.

If only I knew more about how it worked. Zarabeth, you said that you

were brought here as a prisoner. May I ask 

ZARABETH: Why? My crime was in choosing my kinsmen unwisely. Two of

them were involved in a conspiracy to kill Zor Kahn. 

SPOCK: I remember that name from the history tapes in the library. Zor

Kahn the Tyrant. 

ZARABETH: It was not enough that he execute my kinsmen. Zor Kahn

determined to destroy our entire family. He used the atavachron to send

us places no one could ever find us. 

SPOCK: Zarabeth, I must return to Mister Atoz and the atavachron. We

will carry Doctor McCoy, and you must come with us. I will send you and

the doctor to the ship, and I shall search for Captain Kirk. 

ZARABETH: I can't go through the portal again. If I do, I will die. 

SPOCK: You cannot go back? 

ZARABETH: None of us can go back. When we come through the portal, we

are changed by the atavachron. That is its function. Our basic cell

structure is adjusted to the time we enter. You can't go back. If you

go through the portal again, you will die by the time you reach the

other side. 

MCCOY: (standing) Spock? Where are we? 

ZARABETH: You are safe here, McCoy. 

MCCOY: Yes, I remember you. 

SPOCK: Come, Doctor, back to bed. 

MCCOY: Why are you still here, Spock? Why aren't you looking for Jim? 

SPOCK: It is impossible to look for him, Doctor. We cannot go back. 

MCCOY: What do you mean impossible? We've got to get back. 

SPOCK: Zarabeth explained it to me. When we came through the time

portal, it altered our physiological structure. If we attempt to return

to the library, we shall die. 

MCCOY: Are you trying to tell me that we're trapped here? 

SPOCK: Yes, Doctor, we are trapped. Just as Jim is trapped wherever he

is.

Captain's log, stardate 5943.9. The people of this

time believe in witches, and witchcraft is what I've been accused of.

Five witnesses heard McCoy's voice speak to me and thought it was an

evil spirit. From what I know of witchcraft trials, I don't have much

chance unless I can get to the prosecutor.

[17C Jail]

LAW: No supper for you, love. (lets the wench out

of her cell) Come on. Up you go. 

JAILOR: Give me your cup. 

(Kirk manages to grab his arm and pull him against the bars) 

KIRK: Cry out and I'll break it. Don't move. 

(He takes the keys and unlocks his own cell, lets himself out, knocks

out the jailor and drags in inside, shutting the door behind him. The

Judge comes down the steps) 

JUDGE: Jailor! Jailor! 

KIRK: I'm being falsely accused. You know that. 

JUDGE: You will come with me before the inquisitional tribunal. There

the matter of your witchcraft will be decided. 

KIRK: There are no such things as witches! 

JUDGE: Jailor! That is sacrilege. If they hear you, they will burn you

for such beliefs. 

KIRK: You're the only one that can hear me, and that's the truth. There

are no witches. Why do you deny it? 

JUDGE: Do not let them hear you. There are witches! There are! You

yourself may be discovered to be a witch by the inquisitor. No! What

are you doing? No! 

(Kirk drags him inside the cell) 

JUDGE: Help! Help! 

KIRK: I'll denounce you to the inquisitor. You came here from the

future just as I did. Therefore, you, too, are a witch. 

JUDGE: I beg you. Do not implicate me. They would burn me. 

KIRK: Then help me. 

JUDGE: I will do everything I can to prove you innocent. I will

disprove all the charges of witchcraft. But you must never again speak

to the comrades you left behind. 

KIRK: Help me return to the library. I've lost my way. I must get back

there. 

JUDGE: You cannot get back. 

KIRK: I tell you I must! I had two friends with me, who are lost in

another time period. I must find them. You'll come back with us. 

JUDGE: We can never go back. We must live out our lives here in the

past. The atavachron has prepared our cell structure and our brain

patterns to make life natural here. To return to the future would mean

instant death. 

KIRK: Prepared? I was not prepared. Your Mister Atoz did not prepare me

in any way. 

JUDGE: Then you must get back at once! If you were not transformed, you

can only survive for a few hours here in the past. Come. Hurry. Hurry.

[Cave]

MCCOY: Zarabeth, you are a beautiful cook. Have you

ever been told that? 

ZARABETH: Not recently. 

MCCOY: Oh, well, you'll find that Spock is quite delinquent in those

matters. 

ZARABETH: I hadn't noticed it. 

MCCOY: Oh? Well, now that I'm feeling better, you'll notice a distinct

difference in our approach. 

SPOCK: Really? 

ZARABETH: Itâs something to look forward to. I think you must be well

enough, Doctor, to try the few delicacies this climate has to offer. 

MCCOY: No, not yet. 

ZARABETH: At your rate of progress, it will be soon, I can see. 

SPOCK: Doctor McCoy is making excellent progress. 

MCCOY: And Mister Spock has been practicing medicine without a license.

Don't let him doctor you. I'm the doctor around here. 

SPOCK: And known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the

Enterprise. 

MCCOY: I wonder where she is. 

SPOCK: Five thousand years in the future. 

MCCOY: Thank you. 

(Zarabeth leaves them) 

MCCOY: I wonder where Jim is. 

SPOCK: Who knows. We can only hope that he is well, wherever he is. 

MCCOY: What do you mean, we can only hope? Haven't you done anything

about it? 

SPOCK: What was there to do? 

MCCOY: Locate the portal. It can't be too far.

SPOCK: We've been through all that, Doctor. What's the point of

rehashing that subject? We can't get back. Wasn't that clear to you? 

MCCOY: Yes, that was clear to me. 

SPOCK: Then perhaps you were too ill to understand what can't get back

means. 

MCCOY: I don't believe it, Spock. Itâs just not like you to give up

trying. 

SPOCK: Then I'll repeat it for you. Get this through your head. We

can't get back. That means we are trapped here in this planet's past

just as we are, and we'll stay here for the rest of our lives. Now do

you understand? 

MCCOY: Yes, I understand. I never thought I'd hear it, but I

understand. You want to stay here. As a matter of fact, you're highly

motivated to stay in this forsaken waste. 

SPOCK: The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago. 

MCCOY: You listen to me, you pointed-eared Vulcan. 

SPOCK: I don't like that. I don't think I ever did, and now I'm sure. 

MCCOY: What's happening to you, Spock? 

SPOCK: Nothing that shouldn't have happened long ago. 

MCCOY: Long ago. Of course. Long ago.

[17th Century]

(Back in the street, at the wall Kirk came through)



JUDGE: This is where it is. I can't remember the exact spot. 

(Kirk feels along the wall until his hand disappears into it) 

JUDGE: That's it! That is the portal. I cannot wait any longer. 

(The judge hurries away, and Kirk slips through the wall back into the

library)

[Library]

KIRK: Spock? McCoy? Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. 

SCOTT [OC]: Scott here, Captain. 

KIRK: How much time before the sun blows up? 

SCOTT [OC]: Seventeen minutes. You three had better come back right

away. 

KIRK: We can't, Scotty. Spock and McCoy are missing. 

SCOTT [OC]: I knew there was trouble. I've got a landing party standing

by. 

KIRK: No. Under no circumstances send anyone else here without my

orders. Prepare to warp out and stand by. Kirk out. Mister Atoz, where

are you? 

ATOZ: May I help you? Itâs you. You're lucky you found your way back

here. Now let me process you through the atava 

KIRK: No. Mister Atoz, my friends and I are from another planet. We

don't belong in your history. We don't belong on your planet at all. 

ATOZ: Just let me take care of you and get you back where you belong. 

KIRK: No. I want to find the exact disc that they were viewing. 

ATOZ: Please, go back! 

KIRK: I'm sorry, Mister Atoz. Mister Atoz! 

(They tussle) 

ATOZ: I must prepare to escape. 

(Kirk pushes him into a side room and shuts the door, then turns to

face another Atoz) 

KIRK: I'll let you out in a minute. Still up to your little game of

replicas? Which are you this time, real or not? 

(He knocks this one out) 

ATOZ: You are evidently a suicidal maniac. I donât understand what

you're trying to do, but if you continue, both of us will die. and I

for one, do not wish death. 

KIRK: If you help me, we won't die. I promise you that. 

ATOZ: I don't trust you. 

KIRK: Which one are you now, the replica or the real one? 

ATOZ: I am the real Atoz. You've done away with my replicas. I regret

what I must now do. 

KIRK: You don't really want to hurt me, do you? You've been trying to

save my life. I realise that. Put that thing away. 

(But Atoz fires the little tube at Kirk and he falls to the floor)

[Cave]

ZARABETH: I cannot pretend to be sorry that you are

here, though I realise it is a misfortune for you. I'm here against my

will too, just as you are. 

SPOCK: I'm sorry. I know of no way to return you to your own time. 

ZARABETH: It's not that I wish to return. This is my time now. I've had

to face that. But it has been lonely here. Do you know what it's like

to be alone? Really alone? 

SPOCK: Yes. I know what it is like. 

ZARABETH: I believe you do. Have something to eat, please. 

SPOCK: If it pleases you. This is animal flesh? 

ZARABETH: There's not much else to eat around here, I'm afraid. 

SPOCK: Naturally, because of the climate. What is the source of heat in

the shelter? 

ZARABETH: There's an underground hot spring. 

SPOCK: Excellent. Then it will be possible to build a greenhouse of

sorts. Meanwhile, this will have to do as the only source of

nourishment. 

(He takes a bite) 

ZARABETH: There aren't many luxuries around here. Zor Kahn only left me

what was necessary to survive. 

SPOCK: But he evidently intended that you continue living. 

ZARABETH: Yes. He gave me weapons, a shelter, food. Everything I needed

to live except companionship. He did not want it said that he had me

killed. But to send me here alone, if that is not death, what is? A

very inventive mind, that man. 

SPOCK: But insensitive, to send such a beautiful woman into exile. The

cold must've affected me more than I realised. Please pay no attention.

I'm not myself. I'm behaving disgracefully. I have eaten animal flesh

and I have enjoyed it. What is wrong with me? I tell you you're

beautiful. But you are beautiful. Is it so wrong to tell you so? 

ZARABETH: I have longed to hear you say it. 

(They kiss, then he picks her up and smiles broadly) 

SPOCK: You are beautiful. More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've

ever known.

(He lays her down and .... sets the scene for many fan-fictions)

[Library]

(Kirk wakes up lying on a sled, which Atoz is

pushing towards the portal) 

ATOZ: Just stay where you are, sir. I'll see you get to safety. 

(Kirk rolls off, so Atoz tries to push him through. He fails, and gets

overpowered) 

KIRK: Now, you're going to help me look for my friends. 

ATOZ: You're a most determined man. 

KIRK: Kirk here. 

SCOTT [OC]: What's happening? Why are you waiting? 

KIRK: No time to explain. Are you ready to warp out? 

SCOTT [OC]: Aye, Captain. 

KIRK: Stand by to beam us up. But when that star explodes, don't wait.

Get out fast. Kirk out. Now we're going to start looking. They were in

a frozen waste. I could hear the wind. 

ATOZ: All right, all right. All right! It must be the Sarpeidon Ice

Age, five thousand years ago. Let me look. 

KIRK: We'll both look, Mister Atoz.

[Cave]

MCCOY: Spock. You've been dishonest with me, Spock,

and that is also something new for you. 

SPOCK: I've given you the facts, Doctor. 

MCCOY: The facts as you know them. Or did you just accept Zarabeth's

word because it's what you wanted to believe? 

SPOCK: You were told the truth. If Zarabeth is the source, what

difference does it make? 

MCCOY: Zarabeth is a woman condemned to a terrible life of loneliness.

She would do anything to anybody to change that. Wouldn't you,

Zarabeth? 

ZARABETH: I told you what I know. 

MCCOY: Did you? You said we can't get back. The truth is you can't get

back. 

SPOCK: She would not jeopardise other lives. 

MCCOY: She would do anything to prevent that life of loneliness. She

would lie. She would cheat. She would even murder me, the captain, the

entire crew of the Enterprise to keep you here with her. Go ahead,

Zarabeth, tell Spock the truth. Go ahead. Tell Spock you would kill! 

SPOCK: What are you doing to her? 

(Spock pins McCoy against the cave wall) 

MCCOY: Are you trying to kill me, Spock? Is that what you really want?

Think. What are you feeling? Rage? Jealousy? Have you ever had those

feelings before? 

SPOCK: This is impossible. Impossible. I am a Vulcan. 

MCCOY: The Vulcan you knew won't exist for another five thousand years.

Think, man. What's happening on your planet right now, this very

moment? 

SPOCK: My ancestors are barbarians. Warlike barbarians. 

MCCOY: Who nearly killed themselves off with their own passions. Spock,

you're reverting into your ancestors five thousand years before you

were born! 

SPOCK: I've lost myself. I do not know who I am. Can we go back? 

ZARABETH: I don't know. I only know that I can't go back. 

MCCOY: I know I'm going to try, Spock, because my life is back there,

and I want that life. 

(So McCoy heads off through the arctic winds, with just a fur shawl for

protection)

[Library]

ATOZ: Do you think that's the right one? 

KIRK: I donât know. 

ATOZ: If weâre to get the portal set for the proper time period, you

must be specific. 

KIRK: I didn't see it. 

ATOZ: Well try calling out. 

KIRK: Bones? Spock! McCoy! You've got the wrong one. 

ATOZ: Please, there's no time left. Let me go. 

KIRK: Try again.

[Ice Age]

(Zarabeth and Spock join McCoy at the ice cliff) 

SPOCK: There's no portal here, Doctor. It's hopeless. 

MCCOY: I suppose you're right. 

SPOCK: You're too ill to remain out here any longer. Give it up.

[Library]

(Atoz views another disc) 

KIRK: Bones. Spock!

[Ice Age]

MCCOY: Itâs Jim! Here we are, Jim.

[Library]

KIRK: I've found them. Can you still hear me? 

SPOCK [OC]: We hear you perfectly, Captain. 

KIRK: Follow my voice.

[Ice Age]

KIRK [OC]: Spock, McCoy, follow my voice. Do you

hear me? Keep following my voice. Spock. McCoy.Â 

SPOCK: This must be it.

[Library]

KIRK: What are you waiting for? Hurry!

[Ice Age]

MCCOY: Come on, Spock. 

SPOCK: You start ahead, Doctor. I do not wish to part from you. 

ZARABETH: I cannot come. If I go back, I will die.

[Library]

KIRK: What are you waiting for? Hurry!

[Ice Age]

SPOCK: How much time do we have?

[Library]

KIRK: Scotty, how much time is there? 

SCOTT [OC]: You've got to come aboard now.

[Ice Age]

MCCOY: Come on, Spock, now! 

(Spock pushes McCoy towards the cliff, but he doesn't go through) 

MCCOY: Something's wrong.

[Library]

KIRK: What's the matter? Why can't he get through? 

ATOZ: I don't know. Unless, it's because they originally went through

the portal together. 

KIRK: Spock, McCoy, you can't get through unless you both come back at

the same time. Scotty. 

SCOTT [OC]: Orders or no, I'm beaming you up first. 

KIRK: No! Wait!

[Ice Age]

KIRK [OC]: Spock, McCoy, hurry through the portal.

Time is running out. 

(Zarabeth turns and leaves them)

[Library]

(McCoy and Spock return without their furs. Atoz

switches discs and runs through the portal) 

KIRK: He had his escape planned. I'm glad he made it. Kirk to

Enterprise. 

SPOCK: There's no further need to observe me, Doctor. As you can see,

I've returned to the present in every sense. 

MCCOY: But it did happen, Spock. 

SPOCK: Yes, it happened. But that was five thousand years ago. And she

is dead now. Dead and buried. Long ago. 

KIRK: Scotty, are you there? 

SCOTT [OC]: Now or never, Captain. 

KIRK: Beam us aboard and go to maximum warp as soon as we're there.

Kirk out.

Intruder

Stardate:

5928.5

Original Airdate: 3 Jun, 1969

 

Captain's log, stardate 5928.5. The Enterprise has received a distress

call from a group of scientists on Camus Two,

who are exploring the ruins of a dead civilisation. Their situation is

desperate. Two of the survivors are the expedition surgeon, Doctor

Coleman, and the leader of the expedition, Doctor Janice Lester.

[Camus II]

(Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down into the

expedition building. Dr Lester is lying on a bed, asleep) 

KIRK: What's wrong with her? 

COLEMAN: Exposure to radiation. 

MCCOY: What form of radiation was it? 

COLEMAN: Nothing I've ever encountered. 

(Janice wakes)Â 

KIRK: Janice, you must remain absolutely quiet. Those are doctor's

orders, not mine. 

SPOCK: Captain. Tricorder picking up very faint life readings.

Approximately seven hundred metres from here. Help will have to be

immediate. 

(Janice grabs Kirk's arms. She makes a noise) 

MCCOY: Perhaps your presence will quiet her. 

(Spock, McCoy and Coleman leave) 

JANICE: I hoped I wouldn't see you again. 

KIRK: I don't blame you. 

JANICE: The year we were together at Starfleet is the only time in my

life I was alive. 

KIRK: I never stopped you from going on with your space work. 

JANICE: Your world of starship captains doesn't admit women. It isn't

fair. 

KIRK: No, it isn't. And you punished and tortured me because of it. 

JANICE: I loved you. We could've roamed among the stars. 

KIRK: We'd have killed each other. 

JANICE: It might have been better. 

(Kirk has a look around the room, and finds a wall-sized device with

strange carvings. Janice sits up, points a remote at it and it lights

up, pulling Kirk onto its surface. Janice gets out of bed, flips a

switch on the device then stands in front of it too. She flips another

switch then the machine works. We are shown images of Janice and Kirk

going into the other's body.) 

(Kirk steps down first and switches the machine off. He carries Janice

back to the bed) 

KIRK: You had your chance, Captain Kirk. You should've smothered the

life in me. Then they would have said Doctor Janice Lester died of

radiation poisoning in the line of duty. Why didn't you do it? You

always wanted to. Didn't you? You had the strength to do it. But you

were afraid. You were always afraid. Now Janice Lester takes the place

of Captain Kirk.

I already possess your physical strength. Only this Captain Kirk is not

afraid to kill. Now you know the indignity of being a woman. For you

this agony will soon pass, as it has for me. Quiet. Quiet! Believe me,

it's better to be dead than to live alone in the body of a woman. It's

better to be dead. 

(He makes to strangle her with her own scarf, but is interrupted by the

sound of footsteps) 

KIRK: Doctor McCoy, your report. 

MCCOY: We were too late, Jim. There's nothing could be done. 

KIRK: Was it radiation as suggested? 

MCCOY: No, I believe it was celebium. However, Doctor Coleman

disagrees. To be specific is essential because the treatment of

celebium is quite 

COLEMAN: Doctor McCoy. 

(He goes over to Janice) 

MCCOY: Did you notice any unusual symptoms while we were gone? 

KIRK: No, nothing at all. She was unconscious all of the time. 

COLEMAN: Doctor Lester is near death. 

KIRK: Perhaps the shock of knowing what happened to her staff is part

of her problem. 

COLEMAN: I'm sure it is. 

MCCOY: Beaming her up to the Enterprise will be less harmful than

waiting. 

COLEMAN: I don't know. I'm not sure. 

KIRK: Captain Kirk to the Enterprise. Captain Kirk to the Enterprise. 

SCOTT [OC]: Mister Scott, sir. 

KIRK: Mister Scott. Prepare to beam the landing party aboard plus two

others. One critically ill. Have a medical team standing by to receive

the patient. Captain Kirk, out. Prepare to beam aboard.

[Transporter room]

(Kirk is carrying Janice in his arms. He puts her

on a gurney) 

KIRK: Doctor Coleman, accompany the patient to the Sickbay. Mister

Spock, take the ship out of orbit. Resume designated course.

Doctor McCoy. Doctor McCoy, you and Doctor Coleman seem to disagree on

diagnosis. 

MCCOY: No, not entirely. We both agree it's radiation. Doctor Coleman

isn't prepared to say what form of radiation. 

KIRK: Will it affect your arriving at a correct treatment? 

MCCOY: It's crucial. 

KIRK: Well, this is especially disturbing to me for personal reasons. 

MCCOY: Oh? I didn't know you knew her that well. 

KIRK: Oh, yes. It's been a long time since I saw her. I walked out on

her when it became serious. 

MCCOY: Well, you must have been very young at the time, Jim. 

KIRK: Youth doesn't excuse everything, Doctor McCoy. It's a very

unhappy memory for me. 

MCCOY: I didn't realise that. I shall do everything in my power. 

KIRK: Thank you. Thank you very much. 

(McCoy leaves) 

SCOTT: Doctor Lester is certainly a very lucky young person to have

escaped. 

KIRK: Yes, very lucky. Very lucky.

[Sickbay]

(Janice is delirious. Coleman is with her. Kirk

enters) 

COLEMAN: It just began. 

KIRK: Well you'd better put a stop to it! If you allow Doctor Lester to

become fully conscious she'll know what has happened. 

COLEMAN: Probably no one will believe it. 

KIRK: Probably? 

COLEMAN: That's all we can ask for. How can death be explained now? 

KIRK: I tell you it can't continue. 

COLEMAN: You killed every one of the staff. You sent them where you

knew the celebium shielding was weak. Now why didn't you kill him? You

had the perfect opportunity. 

KIRK: There wasn't enough time. 

COLEMAN: I gave you every minute you asked for. 

KIRK: He hung onto life too hard. I couldn't 

COLEMAN: You couldn't because you love him. You want me to be his

murderer. 

KIRK: Love? Him? I love the life he led. The power of a starship

commander. It's my life now. 

COLEMAN: I won't become a murderer. 

KIRK: You are a murderer! You knew it was celebium. You could've

treated them for it. You're a murderer many times over. 

(McCoy and a now brunette Chapel enter) 

MCCOY: Jim, what are you doing here? 

KIRK: I thought my presence might quiet Doctor Lester. It seems to have

had the opposite effect. 

COLEMAN: It has nothing to do with you. It's a symptom of the

developing radiation illness. 

MCCOY: Tests with the ship's equipment shows no signs of internal

radiation damage, Doctor Coleman. 

KIRK: Didn't Doctor Lester's staff become delirious before they went

off and died? 

COLEMAN: Yes, Captain. Yes. 

MCCOY: Doctor Lester could be suffering from a phaser stun as far as

the symptoms I can detect, Jim. 

KIRK: Doctor Coleman, Doctor McCoy has had a great deal of experience

with radiation exposure on board the Enterprise.

I am guided by his opinion. 

COLEMAN: Doctor Lester and her staff have been under my supervision for

two years. If you don't follow my recommendations, responsibility for

her health or her death will be yours. 

KIRK: Doctor McCoy, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to take you off

the case and turn it over to Doctor Coleman. 

MCCOY: You can't do this! On this ship my medical authority is final! 

KIRK: Doctor Coleman wants to assume the full responsibility. Let him

do it. 

MCCOY: I won't allow it. 

KIRK: It's done! Doctor Coleman, your patient. Doctor Coleman, didn't

you suggest a sedation to rest the patient? 

COLEMAN: Yes, Captain. 

MCCOY: It's not necessary, Jim. Can't you see she's coming around? 

(Janice opens her eyes, sees Kirk and has flashbacks to the transferal,

just to remind us who is really who) 

KIRK: Doctor Coleman. 

COLEMAN: Nurse, administer the sedative. 

MCCOY: A sedative is not wise at this time, Captain. 

COLEMAN: Nurse Chapel, you have your orders. 

MCCOY: Nurse Chapel, follow your instructions. 

(Chapel injects Janice) 

JANICE: Oh no. Am I really losing command of the Enterprise? No. Oh,

no. Bad dream. Bad dream. 

KIRK [OC]: James Kirk is returning to consciousness in the body of

Janice Lester. The Enterprise is proceeding to its next mission,

on the course set before I took over command. Now the years I spent

studying every single detail of the ship's operation will be tested.

With a little experience, I will be invulnerable to suspicion. At last

I attain what is my just due. Command of a starship. All the months of

preparation now come to fruition.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Course, Mister Chekov. 

CHEKOV: One two seven mark eight. 

KIRK: Mister Sulu, set speed at warp factor two. 

SULU: Warp factor two, sir. 

KIRK: Mister Chekov, plot a course for the Benecia Colony. 

CHEKOV: Direct course to Benecia, three seven three mark eight. 

KIRK: How long to the colony at our present speed? 

CHEKOV: Forty-eight hours, sir. 

KIRK: Mister Sulu, set course for the colony. Three seven three mark

eight. 

SULU: Aye, sir. Three seven three mark eight. 

SPOCK: Captain, that will delay our work at Beta Aurigae. It means

reversing course. 

KIRK: Yes, it can't be helped. We must take Doctor Lester to a place

where she can be treated. 

SPOCK: May I point out that Starbase Two is on the direct route to our

destination. 

KIRK: How long to Starbase Two? 

CHEKOV: Seventy two hours, Captain. 

KIRK: It's twenty four hours too long. Doctor Lester's condition is

increasingly serious. Continue present course. 

SULU: Aye, sir. 

SPOCK: If the diagnosis of Doctor Lester's illness is the critical

problem, then the Benecia Colony is definitely not the place for her.

Their medical facilities are the most primitive. 

KIRK: They will have to serve. 

SPOCK: Starbase Two is fully equipped and staffed with the necessary

specialists to determine exactly what is wrong with the doctor. Is that

not crucial to your decision? 

KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock, but the facilities will be of little use

if Doctor Lester's dead. Time is of the essence. Continue present

course. 

SPOCK: At maximum speed, Starbase Two would still meet the emergency. 

LYSA: Captain, shall I advise Starfleet Command of the change of plan? 

KIRK: No change of plan has been ordered, Lieutenant. Our arrival at

Beta Aurigae will merely be delayed. Our gravitational studies of that

binary system will not suffer, and a life may be saved! That is not

unusual procedure for the Enterprise. 

SPOCK: Sir, I believe Starfleet will have to be notified that our

rendezvous with the starship Potemkin will not take place as scheduled.



KIRK: Mister Spock, if youâd concentrate on the areas for which you are

responsible, Starfleet Command would've been informed already. 

SPOCK: Since the captain usually deals with Starfleet in these matters,

I assumed that my suggestions might be deemed interference. 

KIRK: Inform Starfleet of the delay, Lieutenant. 

LYSA: Aye, sir. 

KIRK: Continue present course. Increase speed to warp factor six.

[Kirk's quarters]

(Kirk is sitting at his desk, filing his nails) 

MCCOY: I'll let my record speak for me. 

KIRK: Why are you being so defensive? There's no implied criticism of

you in my order to remove you from the case. 

MCCOY: That is not the reason I'm here. I'm here because Doctor

Coleman's record states that he's incompetent. 

KIRK: That's the opinion of an individual. 

MCCOY: No, sir. That is the opinion of Starfleet Command. I checked

with them. Doctor Coleman was removed from his post as Chief Medical

Officer of his ship for administrative incompetence. 

KIRK: There are no administrative duties required here. 

MCCOY: As well as flagrant medical blunders. 

KIRK: Promotions and demotions can be politically manoeuvred. You know

that, Bones. 

MCCOY: Not in Starfleet Headquarters, Captain. And certainly not in the

Surgeon General's office. 

KIRK: I'm afraid the order will have to stand. I can only say that

Doctor Coleman's experience with what happened on the planet had to be

the deciding factor here. Iâm sure that you can appreciate that. 

MCCOY: I appreciate the fact that you had a decision to make. I also

find myself in that position now, Jim, and I'm asking you to report for

an examination. 

KIRK: What? What do you base that on? 

MCCOY: Development of emotional instability and erratic mental

attitudes since returning from that planet. 

KIRK: You'll never make that charge stick. Any fool can see why you're

doing this. 

MCCOY: I'll let Starfleet Command be the judge of my motives. 

KIRK: I won't submit to this petty search for revenge! 

MCCOY: But you will submit to Starfleet regulations, and they state

that the ship surgeon will require full examination of any crew member

that he has doubts about, including the captain. 

(intercom whistles) 

KIRK: Captain Kirk here. 

SULU: Sulu here, Captain. Starfleet Command is requesting additional

details on the delay. 

KIRK: I'll be right there.

[Sickbay]

(Janice wakes up. She looks at the monitor above

her bed) 

JANICE: Pulse, pressure, blood count, all body functions normal. Then

why am I here? 

(Gets out of bed and notices that she is not herself) 

JANICE: Doctor McCoy? Doctor McCoy 

(Coleman enters) 

COLEMAN: Quiet would be best for you. 

JANICE: Where's Doctor McCoy? 

COLEMAN: I'm in charge now. 

JANICE: Bring Doctor McCoy at once! He is in command of medicine on

this ship. 

COLEMAN: He was taken off your case by Captain Kirk. 

JANICE: By Captain Kirk? 

COLEMAN: It was done for your own protection, Doctor Lester. 

JANICE: I am not Janice Lester! She did this to me! Now how can I make

you understand? Janice has driven herself mad with jealousy, hatred and

ambition. 

(Chapel enters) 

JANICE: Nurse Chapel. Bring Mister Spock and Doctor McCoy to me at

once. Now they must believe I am not Janice Lester. I am imprisoned in

her body, but I am not Janice Lester. 

COLEMAN: She is suffering from the delusion of being Captain Kirk. 

JANICE: I am not Janice Lester! 

COLEMAN: The paranoia has been developing for the past six months. The

radiation seems to have intensified it. She must be kept sedated. 

CHAPEL: Shall prepare a mild sedative, Doctor? 

COLEMAN: Of course. 

(Chapel leaves) 

(Janice sees her reflection in a mirror) 

COLEMAN: You are insane, Doctor Lester.

Captain's log, stardate unknown. I have lost track

of time. I am still held captive in a strange body and separated from

all my crew.

[Sickbay]

(Janice wakes. There is a single restraining strap

across the bed) 

JANICE: I must've sounded quite mad to you before. 

CHAPEL: What you've been through would've completely broken most of us.



JANICE: Well, I'll be all right now. Could I see your Doctor McCoy? 

CHAPEL: I'm afraid that's against Doctor Coleman's orders. 

JANICE: Oh. Is a visit by that very kind Mister Spock to be allowed? 

CHAPEL: Perhaps that can be arranged before we reach the Benecia

Colony. 

JANICE: The Benecia Colony? But isn't the Enterprise going to

rendezvous with the Potemkin at Beta Aurigae? 

CHAPEL: Well, first we have to let you recuperate at Benecia. (offering

a drink) You'll feel better if you have a little. 

JANICE: Well, I'll try. Thank you. Oh, it is good. Thank you. Could I

finish it slowly, Nurse Chapel? 

CHAPEL: Well 

JANICE: I promise I'll be good. 

CHAPEL: Well, I'll be right back. I'm glad you're feeling so much

better. 

(Chapel leaves, Janice pours the drink on the floor and breaks the

glass against the bed. Then she uses it to cut the strap holding her

down)

[Sickbay - exam ward]

MCCOY: These tests should help me pinpoint the

cause of Jimâs illness. 

SPOCK: Good. Knowledge of the captain's aberrant behaviour is spreading

through the ship. The crew is becoming increasingly tense. 

MCCOY: Yes, well what worries me most is that Jim seems completely

unaware that something is wrong with him. We've got to make him realise

that something serious is happening before treatment can even begin. 

SPOCK: I'm afraid that is a forlorn hope, Doctor. The illness appears

to be primarily mental. 

MCCOY: One of us should be able to get to him. I keep looking for an

approach, but the speed at which the illness has traveled makes it

doubly difficult. 

SPOCK: Perhaps the Surgeon General's office should be alerted. 

MCCOY: You know headquarters, Spock. They're only interested in results

of specific tests. So far all we have to offer are our opinions. 

SPOCK: Are you sure that the captain will comply with your order in his

present state of mind? 

MCCOY: I'll use my medical authority to enforce it if necessary. 

SPOCK: Doctor, we are treading on very thin ground. Actions such as

these might be misinterpreted. 

MCCOY: Well, then, so be it. Our responsibility is clear. 

SPOCK: Whatever happened to the captain on that planet must've taken

place in the short space of time that he was alone with Doctor Lester.

Perhaps a conversation with her might shed some light. 

MCCOY: Well, it's worth a try. Why don't you try to get to Doctor

Lester while I examine Jim. 

(Kirk enters) 

KIRK: Well, gentlemen. I'm here, Doctor. 

(Janice has run down the corridor and now enters) 

JANICE: Spock. Bones. Help me. Don't let them lock me away from you.

I've got to talk to you. 

(She backs out into the corridor and Kirk follows her)

[Corridor]

(Kirk knocks her out) 

MCCOY: Jim! 

KIRK: She might have killed someone. 

(Two security guards arrive) 

KIRK: Put her in isolation in her room. Maintain a twenty four hour

watch. No one, absolutely no one, is to talk to her without my

permission! 

GALLOWAY: Yes, sir. 

(Spock leaves) 

MCCOY: Captain. 

(McCoy and Kirk re-enter the exam room)

[Outside Lester's room]

SPOCK: How is the doctor? 

GALLOWAY: She regained consciousness very quickly. 

SPOCK: Good. I have questions to ask her. 

GALLOWAY: Did the captain order it, sir? 

SPOCK: Why should he? They are my questions, therefore I am ordering

it, Lieutenant. 

GALLOWAY: The captain said no one is allowed to speak to Doctor Lester.



SPOCK: Has such an order ever included his senior officers? 

GALLOWAY: No, sir. Mister Spock, I think the captain meant that a guard

should be present. 

SPOCK: By all means, Lieutenant.

[Exam room]

(Shirt off, Kirk is doing the heart rate exercise) 

MCCOY: That's enough. That's enough. Your heart will last forever,

Captain. 

KIRK: How am I otherwise? 

MCCOY: In the pink, as usual. Liver, kidney, blood count, metabolic

rate. Everything, even your glands, functioning at their usual, normal

peak of efficiency. 

KIRK: Good. I hope you're as pleased about it as I am. 

MCCOY: Don't get dressed yet. 

KIRK: You said I was in perfect condition. 

MCCOY: Physically. 

KIRK: I don't think another test is necessary. 

MCCOY: The Robbiani dermal-optic is crucial. It reveals the basic

emotional structure. You had one once before. Now I need another one to

compare with that previous test. There should be no change in your

dermal-optic reactions to the colour wavelengths. Over here, Captain.

Over here, Captain.

[Janice's room]

SPOCK: Complete life-entity transfer with the aid

of a mechanical device? 

JANICE: Yes, that's what it must've been. 

SPOCK: To my knowledge, such total transfer has never been accomplished

with complete success anywhere in the galaxy. 

JANICE: It was accomplished and forgotten long ago on Camus Two. I am a

living example. 

SPOCK: That is your claim. As yet, it is unsubstantiated by any

external evidence or objective tests. 

JANICE: Nevertheless, Spock, it is the truth I'm speaking.

[Exam room]

Kirk is being bathed in coloured light with his

eyes closed) 

MCCOY: Now lower your arms and open your eyes.

[Janice's room]

SPOCK: At this moment Doctor McCoy is examining the

captain for psychological changes. If any facts are uncovered, that

would be acceptable evidence. The only kind which is acceptable to

Starfleet Command and to the crew of the Enterprise. 

JANICE: Spock, when I was caught in the interspace of the  Tholian

Sector, you risked your life and the Enterprise to get me

back. Help me get back now. When the 

Vians of Minara demanded that we let Bones die, we didn't

permit it. 

SPOCK: That is true. The captain did not. However, those events have

been recorded. They could have become known to you. 

JANICE: You are closer to the captain than anyone in the universe. You

know his thoughts. What does your telepathic mind tell you now? 

(Under the watchful gaze of the guard, Spock does a quick mind-link) 

SPOCK: I believe you. However, my belief is not acceptable evidence.

Evidence must be factual. Doctor McCoy may be of help. Come with me. 

GALLOWAY: Iâm sorry, sir, but Doctor Lester cannot leave here.

[McCoy's office]

KIRK: Well, are you satisfied with the results of

the tests? 

MCCOY: There is no positive evidence of any disorder.

[Janice's room]

GALLOWAY: You're asking me to violate the captain's

orders. 

SPOCK: He is not the captain. 

GALLOWAY: You're as mad as she is. You're to leave here at once. I

follow orders. 

SPOCK: Certainly, Lieutenant. We all must do our duty. 

(Spock walks past him and feints a neck pinch. It is parried so he gets

him with the other hand) 

GALLOWAY: Security guard!

[McCoy's office]

(Shaking hands) 

KIRK: No hard feelings, Bones. You did your usual thorough, good job. 

MCCOY: I'm sure everything's going to be all right. 

ENSIGN [OC]: Captain Kirk! 

KIRK: Captain Kirk here. 

ENSIGN [OC]: Escape attempt by Doctor Lester. 

KIRK: Captain Kirk to Security. On the double to Doctor Lester's room!

[Outside Janice's room]

SPOCK: It's quite all right, Ensign. Everything is

under control. 

(Neck-pinches him as McCoy and Kirk arrive. Then two more security come

out of the turbolift) 

KIRK: Phasers. 

SPOCK: A repetition of your physical violence is not called for, sir.

No physical resistance will be offered. 

KIRK: Attention, all personnel. First Officer Spock has been placed

under arrest. He has conspired with Doctor Lester to take over the ship

from your captain. A hearing will be immediately convened to consider

the charges and specifications of a general court martial on the charge

of mutiny.

Captain's Log, stardate 5930.3. The results of

Doctor McCoy's examination have given me complete confidence in myself.

My fears are past. I shall function freely as the captain. I am the

captain of the Enterprise, in fact.

[Courtroom]

(Scott is questioning Spock, but the log entry

obliterates some of the evidence) 

SCOTT: Surely you must have more than that to go on. 

SPOCK: I have stated my evidence. Telepathic communication with the

mind of Captain James T. Kirk. 

SCOTT: Your evidence is completely subjective. We have to have evidence

that we can examine out in the open. 

SPOCK: You've had great deal of evidence, except that of the chief

witness. The one who should be the real subject of this investigation

is kept locked away and in isolation. Why, Captain? 

KIRK: She's dangerously insane. We've seen the evidence. 

SPOCK: She is dangerous only to your authority, sir. 

KIRK: Mister Spock. Mister Spock, my authority has been given to me by

Starfleet Command, and only that high authority can take it away. 

SPOCK: The witness, sir. Bring on the witness. Let your officers put

the questions. 

KIRK: Mister Lemli, have Doctor Janice Lester brought here. 

LEMLI: Aye, sir. 

(The security man leaves) 

KIRK: Doctor McCoy, while Mister Spock was busy with his ambitious

plot, what were you doing? 

MCCOY: Examining you. 

KIRK: Oh, yes. You were deeply concerned about my health, emotional and

physical, since leaving Camus Two. Is that correct? 

MCCOY: Yes, that's correct. 

KIRK: Instead of trying to destroy me, you were searching for ways to

help me. Doctor McCoy, for the record, will you tell the court your

findings? 

MCCOY: The captain is in the best of physical condition. His emotional

and mental state is comparable to the time that he assumed command of

the Enterprise. 

KIRK: Thank you, Doctor McCoy. Mister Spock, were you aware of Doctor

McCoy's findings? 

SPOCK: I know them now. 

KIRK: And what have you to say now? 

SPOCK: I am disappointed and deeply concerned that there is no

objective evidence to support my position. So far. 

(Lemli enters with Janice and Coleman) 

KIRK: Doctor Coleman, if youâre required here, we'll call you. 

(Coleman leaves. Janice takes the witness stand) 

KIRK: We certainly appreciate your being here. Everyone is deeply aware

that you have been subjected to inordinate emotional stress. We had

hoped to avoid any further stress, but Mister Spock disagrees. It is

his opinion that your testimony is important in determining the merits

of his case. And since we are solely interested in arriving at a just

decision, I'm going to have to ask you a few more questions. I'll try

not to upset you. You claim that, that you are Captain James T. Kirk? 

JANICE: No. I am not Captain Kirk. That is very apparent. I claim that

whatever it is that makes James Kirk a living being special to himself

is being held here in this body. 

KIRK: Oh. Well. However, as I understand it, I am Doctor Janice Lester.



JANICE: That's very clever, but I didn't say it. I said, the body of

James Kirk is being used by Doctor Janice Lester. 

KIRK: A subtlety that somehow escapes me. I assume that this switch was

arrived at by mutual agreement. 

JANICE: No. It was brought about by a violent attack by Doctor Lester

and the use of equipment she discovered on Camus Two. 

KIRK: Violence by the lady, perpetrated on Captain Kirk? I ask the

assembled personnel to look at Doctor Janice Lester and visualise that

historic moment. Can you, can you tell me why Doctor Janice Lester

would agree to this ludicrous exchange? 

JANICE: Yes. To get the power she craved, to attain a position she

doesn't merit by temperament or training. And most of all, she wanted

to murder James Kirk, a man who once loved her. But her intense hatred

of her own womanhood made life with her impossible. 

KIRK: Are you prepared with witnesses? One will do. 

SPOCK: Sir, there is only one issue here. Is the story of life-entity

transfer believable? This crew has been to many places in the galaxy.

They've been witness to many strange events. They are trained to know

that what seems to be impossible often is possible, given the

scientific analysis of the phenomenon. 

KIRK: Mister Spock, have you ever heard of a case such as described by

Doctor Janice Lester? 

SPOCK: Not precisely, no. 

KIRK: Oh. Assuming that you are correct in your belief, do you expect

Starfleet Command to place this er, this er, person in command of the

Enterprise? 

SPOCK: I expect only to reveal the truth. 

KIRK: And with the truth revealed, that I am not really the captain,

and knowing that she would not be allowed to serve as the captain, then

you would be the captain! It is inevitable! Spock. Spock, give it up!

Return to the Enterprise family. All charges will be dropped and the

madness that temporarily overcame all of us on Camus Two will fade and

be forgotten. 

SPOCK: And what will become of Doctor Lester? 

KIRK: Doctor Lester will be cared for always. It is a debt and a

responsibility I owe her from the past. 

SPOCK: No, sir. I shall not withdraw a single charge that I have made.

You are not Captain Kirk. You have ruthlessly appropriated his body,

but the life entity within you is not that of Captain Kirk. You do not

belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my

power against you. 

KIRK: Lieutenant Lysa, play back those last two sentences from Mister

Spock's tirade. 

SPOCK [OC]: You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall

do everything in my power against you. 

KIRK: You heard the statements placed into the record by you. Do you

understand the nature of it? 

SPOCK: I do. And I stand by it. 

KIRK: (thumping the table) It is mutiny! Deliberate, vindictive, insane

at its base! But mutiny is charged, and encouragement to mutiny. Doctor

McCoy, Mister Scott, you heard it! On the basis of these statements, I

call for an immediate vote, by the powers granted to me as captain of

the Enterprise. A recess is declared, to be followed by a vote. 

SPOCK: Yes, sir. An immediate vote before our chief witness can be left

to die on some obscure planet with the truth locked away inside of her.



KIRK: Silence. You will be silent! A recess has been declared. There

will be no cross-discussion. When I return, we will vote on the charge

of mutiny. The evidence presented here is the only basis of your

decision.

[Corridor]

MCCOY: Scotty. 

SCOTT: Doctor. Doctor, I've seen the captain feverish, sick, drunk,

delirious, terrified, overjoyed, boiling mad. But up to now I have

never seen him red-faced with hysteria. I know how I'm going to vote. 

MCCOY: I've been through this with Spock. He's not being scientific and

neither are you. 

SCOTT: It may not be scientific, but if Mister Spock thinks it

happened, then it must be logical. 

MCCOY: Don't you think I know that? My tests show there's nothing wrong

with the captain. Now that's the only fact Starfleet's going to be

interested in. 

SCOTT: Headquarters has its problems, and we have ours. And right now,

the captain of the Enterprise is our problem.

They're going to call for the vote in a few minutes. Let me put one

last question. Suppose you vote with me, in favour of Spock. That means

two votes to one and Spock is free. What do you think the captain'll

do? 

MCCOY: I don't know. 

SCOTT: Aye, you know, all right. It'll stick in his craw. He'll never

accept it. 

MCCOY: We don't know that. 

SCOTT: I tell you, he won't. Then, Doctor, that's the time we move

against him. We'll have to take over the ship. 

MCCOY: We're talking about mutiny, Scotty. 

SCOTT: Aye. Are you ready for the vote? 

MCCOY: Yes. I'm ready for the vote.

[Courtroom]

KIRK: Play the tapes of the conversation in the

corridor. 

LYSA: Aye, sir. 

SCOTT [OC]: Then's the time we move against him. Weâll have to take

over the ship. 

MCCOY [OC]: We're talking about mutiny, Scotty. 

SCOTT [OC]: Aye. Are you ready for the vote? 

MCCOY: That's enough. We know what was said. 

KIRK: Enough to convict you of conspiracy with mutineers. And you're so

charged. The sentence, death. Mister Lemli. 

CHEKOV: Starfleet expressly forbids the death penalty. 

KIRK: All my senior officers turning against me? 

SULU: The death penalty is forbidden. There's only one exception. 

CHEKOV: General Order Four. It has not been violated by any officer on

the Enterprise. 

KIRK: I am responsible. The execution will be immediate. Go to your

posts. Go to your posts. 

(Chekov and Sulu leave) 

KIRK: Mister Lemli, take them to the brig. Prepare for execution. Go

on! 

(Scott and McCoy are escorted out at phaser point. Janice follows and

Spock follow, also under armed guard)

[Bridge]

SULU: The captain really must be going mad if he

thinks he can get away with an execution. 

CHEKOV: Captain Kirk wouldn't order an execution even if he were going

mad. That cannot be the captain. 

SULU: What difference does it make who he is? Are we going to allow an

execution to take place? 

CHEKOV: If security backs him up, how will we fight him? 

SULU: I'll fight them every way and any way I can. 

(Kirk enters) 

KIRK: Lieutenant Lysa, inform all sectors of my decision. Have each

section send a representative to the place of execution on the hangar

deck. Mister Chekov, how far to the Benecia Colony? 

CHEKOV: Coming within scanning range. 

KIRK: Plot co-ordinates for orbit. Mister Sulu, lock into co-ordinates

as soon as orbit is accomplished. Interment will take place on Benecia.



(Chekov and Sulu remove their hands from their controls) 

KIRK: You have received your orders! You will obey my orders. Youâll be

charged with mutiny! You will obey my orders or, or, 

(He starts convulsing, and Janice is doing the same in the brig)

[Brig]

JANICE: For a moment, I thought that I was up on

the bridge. 

SPOCK: Perhaps you were. 

MCCOY: Then it's possible the transference can be broken. 

JANICE: Well, if it happens again, I'll fight to stay there. 

SCOTT: The bridge is where you belong. 

SPOCK: To accomplish that, each one of us must be ready to seize any

opportunity to break out of here and attack.

[Medical lab]

KIRK: Arthur, the transference is weakening. 

COLEMAN: What happened? 

KIRK: For a moment, I found myself back with the prisoners. I will not

go back to being Janice Lester. You must help me prevent it. 

COLEMAN: The only way to prevent the transference is by the death of

Janice Lester. You must carry out the execution. 

KIRK: I can't. I can't. The crew is in mutiny. You must kill her for

me. 

COLEMAN: I have done everything else for you. But I will not murder for

you. 

KIRK: Then do it for yourself. If Kirk doesn't die, we'll both be

exposed as murderers. Does that give you any choice? 

(Coleman gets a phaser and a hypo-spray) 

KIRK: The dosage should be doubly lethal. 

COLEMAN: It is.

[Brig]

(which strangely looks straight out into the

corridor) 

KIRK: To prevent further conspiracy, you will be removed to separate

cells. If thereâs any resistance, you'll be given a sedative until you

learn co-operation. Doctor Lester will be first. Follow Doctor Coleman.



(Janice steps out into the corridor) 

SPOCK: May I point out, Captain 

(Janice struggles with Coleman) 

KIRK: Kill him! Kill him! 

(Then Kirk goes into another convulsion. The rest of the prisoners

stroll into the corridor as the transfer undoes itself) 

JANICE: Ohh! I've lost to the captain. I've lost to James Kirk! I want

you dead! I want you dead! I want you dead! Oh, I'm never going to be

the captain. Never. Kill him. 

(She goes to Coleman's arms to weep) 

COLEMAN: You are, you are as I loved you. 

JANICE: Kill him. 

KIRK: Can you do anything for her? 

COLEMAN: I'd like to take care of her. 

MCCOY: Of course. Come with me. 

KIRK: I didn't want to destroy her. 

SPOCK: I'm sure we all understand that, Captain. 

KIRK: Her life could have been as rich as any woman's, if only. If

only.
