PICARD: Target their weapons array only.

WORF: Phasers locked.

PICARD: Fire.

DATA: Direct hit. Their weapon systems are down.

PICARD: Damage report.

WORF: We sustained minimal damage to decks five and seven, sir.

DATA: Sir, the Ferengi ship's power has stabilised. They appear to have

impulse capability.

RIKER: They were just playing dead. Conserving power until we got in

close enough.

PICARD: But why would they attack us in the first place?

RIKER: Somehow I don't think they'll let us beam over there and ask

them.

PICARD: Mister La Forge, how are you coming with that comm. link?

LAFORGE: Almost ready, Captain. All right, let's give it a try.

PICARD: Open a channel.

(a fuzzy viewscreen image that La Forge cleans up)

PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. Will you

please explain why you attacked us?

PRAK [on viewscreen]: Our attack? We were defending ourselves. Do you

deny that you are responsible for disabling my vessel?

PICARD: DaiMon, your ship was adrift, your communications inoperative.

We were attempting to assess your status.

PRAK [on viewscreen]: You were attempting to move in for the kill. Do

not toy with me, Picard. We are obviously at your mercy, but know this.

When the Ferengi Council learns of your actions, they will consider

this an act of war.

PICARD: DaiMon, clearly there has been some misunderstanding. I think

it would be in all interests if you were to come aboard and we discuss

this situation.

PRAK [on viewscreen]: I see no reason to trust you, human.

PICARD: In that case, we'll be on our way. I'll relay your position to

your government if you wish, in case you're unable to complete your

repairs and you remain stranded.

PRAK [on viewscreen]: Perhaps it would be better to discuss the

situation.

[Ready room]

PRAK: We detected what appeared to be a Federation

signal buoy. When we approached it, it emitted a massive verteron

pulse. Our warp drive, our sensors, our communications systems were all

disabled. We assumed we were the victims of a new Federation weapon.

PICARD: The Federation established this corridor to ensure safe access

through this sector. We have nothing to gain from mining it.

RIKER: Whatever happened to your ship may not have been an isolated

incident. A Federation Medical transport was recently lost in that

corridor.

PRAK: We passed a Federation ship several days ago. It did not appear

to be in any distress.

RIKER: Can you give us an idea of its heading?

PRAK: It is possible that information was recorded in our sensor logs,

Commander. Unfortunately, my entire crew is occupied with our repairs.

I don't think there will be time to search our records.

PICARD: DaiMon, if we assigned an Engineering team to assist you with

your repair efforts, would that give you time to retrieve your logs?

PRAK: I believe it would, Captain.

[Data's quarters]

(Spot is sitting on the computer console)

DATA: Spot. Spot. Spot, down. Spot, down. Down. Spot. (lifting the cat

off the desk) Down. This is down. Down is good. This is up. Up is no.

(doorbell)

DATA: (to Spot) One moment. Come in.

LAFORGE: Data. I had another idea that might help boost the power

conversion levels. Could you give me a hand?

DATA: I would be happy to.

LAFORGE: Don't tell me you're trying to teach the cat to use the

console.

DATA: It is part of her training programme. I am teaching Spot to jump

down from the desk on my command.

LAFORGE: How's it going?

DATA: I have not been entirely successful.

(Spot meows, and Data goes to the replicator)

DATA: Feline supplement number two twenty one.

LAFORGE: Data, that cat definitely has a mind of her own. Maybe she's

just not trainable.

DATA: I suppose I must accept that possibility. It may be that Spot

lacks the intelligence necessary to learn the appropriate responses to

my commands.

(Spot meows again and Data fetches her a toy)

LAFORGE: I don't know about Spot, but it seems to me your training is

coming along just fine. Come on, let's go.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Data, keep the EPS flow constant will you,

while I re modulate the power taps.

DATA: This procedure will only increase the conversion level by point

eight percent.

LAFORGE: I know, but it could be just enough.

DATA: Enough?

LAFORGE: I just received this from Commander Kaplan, subspace.

(Data reads from a PADD)

DATA: La Forge, I got the Intrepid's power conversion levels up to

ninety seven point one percent. Maybe you should try cleaning your

plasma grid once in a while.

LAFORGE: Can you believe the nerve of that guy?

DATA: We perform maintenance on the plasma grid at regular intervals.

LAFORGE: I know. He's just trying to get me angry. There. That should

do it. Computer, what are the current power conversion levels?

COMPUTER: Power conversion levels are at ninety seven point two

percent.

LAFORGE: Too bad, Mister Kaplan.

Captain's log, supplemental. We have traced the

Fleming's most likely course. It now appears that the vessel may have

come to an unfortunate end.

[Bridge]

(at the science station, grid search pattern

H522-3)

PICARD: What's the origin of this debris field?

DATA: Unknown, sir. It does not appear in any Federation charts of the

Corridor.

PICARD: Could it be what's left of the Fleming?

DATA: It is a possibility. The debris consists primarily of duranium

and polycomposite fragments which suggest a ship. Furthermore, the

field contains sufficient mass to account for the Fleming.

PICARD: All right, let's take a closer look. Perhaps we can find

something that will give us a more positive identification. Helm, take

us through the debris field, ahead slow.

DATA: Captain, I am picking up a small metallic object, approximately

three point five metres in diameter.

RIKER: Could be a ship's log recorder, or a probe casing.

DATA: I do not believe so. It is emitting an unusual signal. Captain,

it is beginning to generate a verteron field.

PICARD: Shields up! Full reverse. Now!

(a sound, then the lights dim)

PICARD: Damage report.

WORF: Warp engines are offline. Shields are down. All subspace systems

are inoperative.

RIKER: Just like the Ferengi ship.

DATA: Unidentified ship heading toward us. Two life forms are aboard.

PICARD: On screen.

DATA: Captain, they are initiating their transporter system.

PICARD: Can we get more power to the shields?

WORF: No, sir.

RIKER: All decks, security alert.

DATA: Captain, we are being boarded.

LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Bridge.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We have intruders in main Engineering. I

need a security team down here immediately.

WORF [OC]: It's on its way.

LAFORGE: What do you want?

RABAL: (male) We're trying to make you listen.

SEROVA: (female) You're killing us.

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: You have made a very serious accusation. I

want you to explain it.

RABAL: Captain, according to our research, warp fields cause a

dangerous reaction in this region of space.

SEROVA: Our planet is already being affected. We have measured large

gravitational shifts throughout our system.

RABAL: If something isn't done, our planet will become uninhabitable.

LAFORGE: Captain, I've heard this theory before. Their research was

evaluated by the Federation Science Council a few years ago. Quite

frankly, it didn't hold up.

SEROVA: That research was only preliminary. Our original analysis was

incomplete.

PICARD: If you wanted us to review your research, you should have made

a request through the Science Council.

RABAL: Their resources are limited. It would have taken over a year

before they dispatched a science ship to come and evaluate our work.

SEROVA: We were not willing to wait any longer. We knew that if we

disabled enough ships, Starfleet would come. Then at least we would be

able to present our case.

RIKER: That's how you rationalise these attacks?

SEROVA: Neither you nor the Ferengi suffered any casualties, Commander.

The actual damage to your vessels was negligible.

RABAL: We dispersed verteron probes in the Corridor merely to disable

warp-driven ships. Nothing more.

RIKER: You can call it whatever you like. The fact remains you

deliberately disguised your probes. You made them look like signal

markers. You hid them in debris field. You mined the Corridor.

PICARD: Mister La Forge, how long do you estimate it will take to

restore the engines?

LAFORGE: Their verteron pulse overloaded our field coils, Captain.

It'll take at least thirty six hours to get underway.

SEROVA: I know precisely how our pulse affected your field coils. With

my help, your ship could be operational in ten hours. Provided you

agree to review our research.

PICARD: Because of the seriousness of your claim, I'm willing to listen

to your case. But let there be no mistake. Our priority here is the

recovery of the Fleming. Now I expect you to help us restore our

engines and deactivate all of the remaining probes in the Corridor. If

you do not, you will both be taken to the brig and from there to the

nearest Starbase, where you will answer charges for what you have done.

RABAL: My sister and I do not wish to impede your rescue process.

SEROVA: Rabal, don't. The probes are the only leverage we have. If we

RABAL: Serova. We will do as you ask, Captain. But please, re-examine

our data.

PICARD: We will. It is part of our job to retain an open mind, even

under these circumstances. Mister La Forge, take them to Engineering.

Get the core back online.

LAFORGE: Yes, sir.

PICARD: Mister Data, I want you to review their research. I'd like your

report as soon as possible.

[Engineering]

SEROVA: There. Shields have been restored. You will

be able to reengage your engines in approximately eight hours.

LAFORGE: You know, even when we get the engines online, it's going to

take at least a week to recalibrate them properly.

SEROVA: I'm sorry you've been inconvenienced. But that's all it is, an

inconvenience. Our concerns are much more important than the condition

of your engines.

LAFORGE: What if the Fleming had been transporting perishable supplies

or was on an emergency mission? Your little plan might have cost a lot

of lives.

SEROVA: That didn't happen, Commander. And saving lives is precisely

what we're trying to do.

LAFORGE: Yeah, well, you have a very interesting way of going about it.

SEROVA: There's no point in trying to talk to you. You've already

decided not to listen.

(Serova leaves)

RABAL: Commander, I know my sister can be somewhat, er, aggravating.

LAFORGE: I'd have to agree with that.

RABAL: But please, try to understand. She believes profoundly in this

cause. She has sworn to dedicate her life to exposing the dangers of

warp drive.

LAFORGE: Warp drive has been around for three centuries. It's a proven

technology.

RABAL: And you sound just like I did, about four years ago.

LAFORGE: You mean you didn't believe her either?

RABAL: No. What I didn't realise was just how brilliant my sister is.

It took two years of study for me even to grasp the principles behind

her theoretical models. They're that sophisticated.

LAFORGE: Well our Commander Data's no slouch. If there's anything

there, he'll find it.

RABAL: Well I hope so, because once we persuade Starfleet to stop warp

travel through the Corridor, we're going to have to convince our own

people to give up warp drive completely.

LAFORGE: Hekaras Two is the only inhabited world in this region.

Without warp drive, you'd be completely isolated from the rest of the

Federation. Are you really willing to take that step?

RABAL: Yes. And if you were in my position, I hope you'd be willing to

do the same thing.

[Stellar Cartography]

DATA: Serova and Rabal believe there are regions of

potential subspace instability within the Corridor. They believe that

if these regions continue to be exposed to warp field energy, they will

rupture. Subspace will extrude into normal space, forming a rift.

PICARD: It's like pacing up and down on the same piece of carpet.

Eventually you wear it out.

DATA: That analogy is essentially correct, sir.

PICARD: Can this theory be proven?

DATA: Not at this time, sir. There is insufficient evidence to do so.

In order to determine whether or not a rift will form, region must be

exposed to warp field energy approximately one million times greater

than that normally generated by a starship.

RABAL: Commander, we believe the warp field effect is cumulative. Each

starship that passes through the Corridor at warp brings us one step

closer to forming a rift.

DATA: I agree that is a possibility. Captain, I suggest we ask the

Federation Science Council to send a research vessel to this area. A

more detailed investigation would resolve many of our questions.

SEROVA: That's your response? More research? More delays. I suppose I

shouldn't have expected anything different.

RIKER [OC]: Bridge to Captain Picard.

PICARD: Go ahead, Number One.

RIKER [OC]: We've located the

[Bridge]

RIKER: Fleming on long range sensors, approximately

zero point three light years away.

PICARD [OC]: What's their condition?

RIKER: The vessel appears to be intact. They have shields, but it looks

like their subspace systems are out.

PICARD [OC]: Very well.

[Stellar Cartography]

PICARD: We'll be underway as soon as our engines

are online.

RIKER [OC]: Aye, sir.

PICARD: I would like you all to put together a research proposal for

the Science Council. I'll give it my full recommendation.

RABAL: Captain, I appreciate the opportunity you're giving us. It's a

beginning that we need

SEROVA: Not we. You can do whatever you want, Rabal. I'll have no part

of this. It's just another delay.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Captain, the engines are back online. All

systems are ready.

PICARD: Very good. Helm, lay in a course for the Fleming.

HELM: Aye, sir.

RIKER: They appear to be in pretty good condition. According to our

sensors their shields back to full strength.

WORF: Captain, the Hekaran ship is moving off. There is one person on

board. It is Serova.

PICARD: Doctor, what is going on?

RABAL: I don't know. Captain, may I speak to her?

PICARD: Mister Worf, open a channel.

RABAL: Serova, what are you trying to do?

SEROVA [on viewscreen]: They wanted proof. I'm going to give it to

them. I'm sorry.

DATA: Captain, the Hekaran ship's engines are beginning to overload. I

believe Serova's attempting to create a warp core breach.

RABAL: No!

RIKER: Prepare for impact.

(KaBOOM! and a purple afterglow)

RIKER: Shields at maximum. Full reverse.

PICARD: Report!

DATA: We have cleared the shock wave. However, tetryon flux in the area

is increasing rapidly.

(there's a swirly thing in the middle of the purple)

RIKER: It's incredible.

PICARD: Mister Data, what's your analysis?

DATA: The event is approximately zero point one light years in

diameter, and it is emitting extremely high levels of tetryon

radiation. It appears to be what Rabal and Serova predicted, a subspace

rift.

LAFORGE: She was right.

PICARD: Can you get a fix on the Fleming? Is she still in one piece?

DATA: Scanning. The Fleming is near its previous coordinates. It

appears to be intact, but it is now within the rift.

PICARD: Doctor, is it possible for a ship to survive in there? Doctor.

I'm sorry about your loss but we need your help now.

RABAL: Of course, Captain.

PICARD: Does the rift pose any danger to the Fleming?

RABAL: I don't know.

(Enterprise shakes)

RIKER: What was that?

LAFORGE: Some kind of high energy distortion wave. Looks like they're

being generated from within the rift.

DATA: IF we maintain our current position, our shields should provide

sufficient protection.

PICARD: What about the Fleming? How long can they survive in there?

DATA: The waves are even more intense within the rift. I estimate her

shields will fail in approximately twelve hours.

RIKER: Can we risk going in there to get them out?

LAFORGE: Not at warp, Commander. According to these readings, the rift

is in a state of accelerating instability which would make it extremely

sensitive to warp field energy. If we go in at warp, we might make it

expand even further.

RIKER: I don't think we have a choice. It would take weeks to reach

them at impulse.

PICARD: I want some better options. Data, Geordi, take Doctor Rabal and

begin an analysis of the rift. We need to find some way to get the

Fleming out of there.

Second Officer's log, stardate 47312.1. Our new

sensor readings have greatly improved our understanding of the rift.

However, we have been unable to find any way to counteract it.

[Stellar Cartography]

LAFORGE: Everything here supports Serova's

theories. I can't find any way to close the rift or even reduce its

size.

(rumble and shake)

DATA: Doctor, is it possible there are areas inside the rift which are

stable, where we can safely use our warp engines?

RABAL: Perhaps. Computer, scan the rift for regions of low instability.

(off the monitor display)

RABAL: There's no area stable enough to withstand a warp pulse.

LAFORGE: Wait a minute. This is strange. Computer, display grid delta

seventeen. Enhance and magnify. What do you make of that?

RABAL: It's a subspace instability outside the rift.

DATA: That should not be possible.

RABAL: Commander, I'm going to begin a field enhanced scan of this

sector. I'd like to take a closer look at this.

LAFORGE: In the meantime, we'd better tell the Captain we don't know

how to get to the Fleming.

DATA: I am not certain that is true. I believe I have an idea.

[Ready room]

DATA: I suggest we coast into the rift.

RIKER: Coast?

DATA: We can initiate a brief, high intensity warp pulse from our

current position. We should be able to attain sufficient velocity to

enter the rift, beam the crew off the Fleming and exit without using

our warp engines.

RIKER: All right, let's say we initiate a full power warp pulse. How

much time do we need to drop out of warp?

DATA: If we field saturate the nacelles, we should be able to sustain

warp speed for approximately two minutes.

RIKER: That doesn't give us much time, and it could get pretty rough in

there.

DATA: The timing will be critical.

PICARD: Begin your calculations, Mister Data. We'll go as soon as

you're ready.

DATA: Aye, sir.

[Engineering]

DATA: I believe the maximum saturation level should

be eighteen point three percent.

LAFORGE: All right. With these parameters, we should be able to

maintain warp speed for two minutes eight seconds. I don't think we can

get any more than that.

DATA: I agree. But based on the size of the rift, it should give us

sufficient time to complete the rescue. Computer, initiate nacelle

field saturation.

LAFORGE: How did we miss it, Data?

DATA: I beg your pardon?

LAFORGE: How did we miss the connection between warp drive and the

formation of the rift? Between the two of us we've logged thousands of

hours on these engines. We're supposed to be warp field experts. We

certainly were wrong this time.

DATA: Technically, Geordi, we were not wrong. Serova's theories rested

on assumptions which were unprovable.

LAFORGE: Seems to me she managed to prove them pretty conclusively.

DATA: By using methods any reputable scientist would never employ.

LAFORGE: Yeah, she was willing to die to make her point. We should have

listened to her more closely, Data.

DATA: We reviewed Serova's research to the best of our abilities, and

we were prepared to continue studying the problem. But that was not

satisfactory.

LAFORGE: Yeah, I can remember times when I was a little stubborn,

trying to get people to believe me when I didn't have enough proof.

DATA: I do not believe that you would have resorted to such extremes.

LAFORGE: But she had to, just to get us to listen. Why was I so

resistant?

DATA: Perhaps because her aggressive methods created an adversarial

situation.

LAFORGE: Yeah. Maybe I was taking the whole thing personally.

DATA: I do not understand.

LAFORGE: Maybe I was a little threatened. The thought that warp engines

might be doing some kind of damage. It's going to take another half an

hour for the nacelles to saturate. Will you call me when they're done?

[Ten Forward]

(Rabal is at a table, staring at the rift)

RABAL: Commander.

LAFORGE: May I join you?

(Rabal nods)

LAFORGE: I wanted to say I'm sorry about your sister.

RABAL: Thank you. I'm trying to tell myself that she died for what she

believed in, but somehow that isn't much comfort.

LAFORGE: I wish it could have happened differently. Maybe I should have

looked at the research more closely. It's possible there's something

that I missed.

RABAL: No. You didn't miss anything. The problem was time. We needed

more time to do the proper research. Serova wasn't willing to wait.

LAFORGE: No. I guess the question is now, where do we go from here?

RABAL: I don't think we can look at space travel the same way anymore.

We're going to have to change.

LAFORGE: I've been in Starfleet for a long time. We depend on warp

drive. I just don't know how easy it's going to be to change.

RABAL: It won't be easy at all.

[Bridge]

DATA: Captain, warp pulse calculations are

complete. We will be firing the engines at maximum intensity for six

point three seconds before disengaging.

WORF: Damage control teams are standing by on all decks.

RIKER: The course to the Fleming is plotted and laid in, sir.

PICARD: Mister La Forge, whenever you're ready.

LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, sir.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Initiating warp pulse now.

[Bridge]

DATA: Engines disengaged. We are now entering the

rift. (rumble) Hull stress is increasing. Eighty three percent of

maximum tolerance and rising.

PICARD: How long until we reach the Fleming?

WORF: One minute twenty two seconds.

RIKER: All transporter rooms are standing by.

WORF: Captain, I am picking up power emissions from the Fleming. They

may be attempting to initiate their warp drive.

RIKER: They might have been able to repair their engines.

DATA: Captain, if they activate

PICARD: I know, Mister Data. Can we establish communication?

WORF: No, sir. Subspace interference is too high.

PICARD: How long until we reach transporter range?

WORF: Fifty three seconds.

RIKER: I don't think we're going to make it.

WORF: Captain, they have initiated their warp drive.

(big rumble)

PICARD: Report.

WORF: Damage on decks six and fourteen. Our structural integrity field

is holding.

RIKER: What about the Fleming?

DATA: They are badly damaged, sir. Their life support systems are

failing.

RIKER: All transporter rooms, prepare emergency evacuation procedures.

DATA: Captain, when the Fleming activated their warp drive, the rift

expanded by two point three percent. We no longer have sufficient

momentum to escape.

(rumble)

DATA: Distortion wave intensity has increased by a factor of ten.

WORF: We are within transporter range of the Fleming, sir. Commencing

evacuation procedures.

DATA: Distortion waves occurring every fifty nine seconds. Hull stress

is nearing maximum tolerance.

RIKER: Data, what if we forced an EPS discharge through the impulse

reactor. Would that be enough to get us out of here?

DATA: I do not believe so, sir, and the resulting explosion would

likely destroy the saucer section in the process.

LAFORGE [OC]: Captain

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We might be able to get out of here

without using the warp engines.

RIKER: How, Geordi?

LAFORGE: When was the last time you went surfing, Commander?

[Bridge]

PICARD: A distortion wave.

LAFORGE [OC]: Exactly, Captain. If can phase match our deflector shield

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: To the EM variance of the distortion wave,

when the next one hits we'll be pulled along with it.

[Bridge]

RIKER: We could ride it through the rift and then

break away once we're clear. That is, if we survive the ride.

PICARD: Is everyone off the Fleming?

WORF: The last of the crew has been beamed aboard, sir.

PICARD: All right, Mister La Forge, get us out of here.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Yes, sir. Phase matching the deflectors

shield now.

[Bridge]

DATA: The next distortion wave will impact in

fourteen seconds.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Matching phases. Prepare to engage the

deflector shield on my mark.

DATA [OC]: Ten seconds.

LAFORGE: And mark.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Engage deflector shield. Full power.

(whumph)

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We lost it.

[Engineering]

DATA: We were unable to maintain phase match with

the distortion wave, sir.

PICARD: What went wrong, Mister La Forge?

LAFORGE [OC]: The speed differential was too high, Captain.

DATA: Another distortion wave approaching. Impact in twenty six

seconds.

RIKER: Our hull stress is already critical. We can't handle many more

jolts like that.

DATA: Captain, I suggest we take the ship to full impulse. If we can

attain sufficient speed, it will lessen the shock when the wave hits.

PICARD: Helm, full impulse. Head us out of the rift. Mister Worf,

channel all available power to the structural integrity fields.

WORF: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Stand by deflector shield.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We're ready, Captain.

[Bridge]

DATA: Distortion wave impact in five seconds.

PICARD: Engage deflector shield, now.

(and they start paddling hard to catch this wave. Whumph)

DATA: We are now within the distortion wave. Hull stresses have

exceeded maximum tolerance.

WORF: Structural integrity fields are failing on decks ten through

sixteen. Switching

to backups.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We're separating from the distortion wave.

I'm attempting to compensate.

[Bridge]

PICARD: How much longer until we clear the rift?

DATA: Approximately twelve seconds, sir. Hull stresses one hundred

twenty percent above tolerance.

WORF: A structural breach is imminent.

(Enterprise stops shaking and the lights come back up to full)

DATA: We have cleared the rift, sir. Hull stress has returned to

normal.

PICARD: Cancel red alert.

Captain's log, stardate 47314.5. We have been

continuing our research, while the Federation Council studies our

preliminary reports on the subspace rift. It now appears certain that

what we've seen here will have repercussions for many years to come.

[Observation lounge]

LAFORGE: Our scans have shown a lot of subspace

instabilities throughout the sector. If they're exposed to enough warp

energies, they could eventually create other rifts.

PICARD: Doctor Rabal?

RABAL: Based on current warp drive patterns in the sector, we've

projected where subspace rifts will be most likely to be formed over

the next forty years. This is the way things are now. This is how

they'll look in ten years. Twenty years. Thirty years. Forty years.

(the monitor display moves up to almost total blue subspace rifts)

PICARD: Thank you, Doctor, Mister La Forge.

(a crewman hands Picard a PADD)

PICARD: Ah. We've received new directives from the Federation Council

on this matter. Until we can find a way to counteract the warp field

effect, the Council feels our best course is to slow the damage as much

as possible. Therefore, areas of space found susceptible to warp fields

will be restricted to essential travel only, and effective immediately

all Federation vessels will be limited to a speed of warp five, except

in cases of extreme emergency.

WORF: The Klingons will observe these restrictions, but the Romulans

will not.

TROI: And what about the Ferengi? And the Cardassians, for that matter?

PICARD: The Federation's sharing all our data with warp-capable

species. We can only hope that they realise it's in their own interests

and take similar action.

CRUSHER: Putting limits on warp speed is only going to prevent other

rifts from forming. What are we going to do about this one?

LAFORGE: Unfortunately, right now there's not much we can do.

RABAL: The gravitational shifts have already begun to affect my

planet's orbit. Our climate is changing.

PICARD: The Federation is setting up a weather control matrix on

Hekaras Two. It's only a temporary solution, but it should suffice for

now.

RIKER: We're lucky the rift took place as far away from the planet as

it did. It gives us some time to consider our options.

PICARD: If there are no more questions, you're all dismissed.

(all but Geordi leave)

LAFORGE: We should have those thermal stabilisers ready for the

Hekarans in another day, sir.

PICARD: Very well. You know, Geordi, I spent the better part of my life

exploring space. I've charted new worlds, I've met dozens of new

species. And I believe that these were all valuable ends in themselves.

Now it seems that all this while, I was helping to damage the thing

that I hold most dear.

LAFORGE: It's won't turn out that way, Captain. We still have time to

make it better.

47410.2

Original Airdate: 22 Nov, 1993



Captain's log, stardate 47410.2. The Atrean government has requested

assistance in averting a natural disaster. Two of their geologists have

come aboard, one of whom is a human who has been living on Atrea Four.

[Observation lounge]

JULIANA: Captain, our situation has worsened since

my husband and I first contacted you. The molten core of our planet is

not just cooling, it's begun to solidify.

PRAN: Our gravitational field has been affected. Seismic activity has

increased by a factor of three.

JULIANA: If the cooling continues at this rate Atrea will become

uninhabitable in thirteen months.

LAFORGE: We could minimise seismic activity by creating isobaric

fissures and relieving some of the tectonic stress, but that would just

be a temporary fix.

DATA: The only permanent solution would be to re-liquefy the core.

LAFORGE: These pockets in the magma layer, how close are they to the

molten region of the core?

JULIANA: A few kilometres, why?

LAFORGE: Data, do you think that's close enough for ferro-plasmic

infusion?

DATA: The procedure will involve using the ship's phasers to drill down

through the planet's surface into the pockets, where we would set up a

series of plasma infusion units.

LAFORGE: We'll trigger the units by firing modulated energy bursts down

through the shafts.

JULIANA: I see. Injecting sufficient plasma directly into the core

should trigger a chain reaction, and that will reliquify the magma.

DATA: It should be possible to stabilise the core temperature at ninety

three percent of normal.

PRAN: If it works, the core would remain molten for centuries.

PICARD: If you give your permission, we could begin immediately.

PRAN: Very well. But before we proceed, I'd like to update our

geological surveys.

LAFORGE: Fine. I'd be very happy to help you with that, Doctor.

PICARD: I've assigned you quarters during out time here. Please, make

yourselves comfortable.

PRAN: Thank you, Captain.

(Pran, Picard and La Forge leave)

JULIANA: Data?

DATA: Yes, Doctor?

JULIANA: Do you have any idea who I am?

DATA: You are Doctor Juliana Tainer.

JULIANA: You lost all your early memories. We thought you would, but we

couldn't be certain.

DATA: Have we met before?

JULIANA: Oh, Data, I was there, right at the beginning on Omicron

Theta. I helped create you. Now look at you.

DATA: You were a colleague of Doctor Soong?

JULIANA: Yes, I certainly was. And I was also his wife. In a way, I

suppose you could say I am your mother.

[Ten Forward]

JULIANA: I still can't believe I'm seeing you like

this again, after all these years.

DATA: Doctor, I have no memory of you.

JULIANA: Oh, there's a reason for that. We wiped your processors after

we finished refining your programming. Why don't you tell me what you

do remember, and then I'll fill in the gaps.

DATA: My memory record begins when I was activated by the Starfleet

officers on the Omicron Theta outpost.

JULIANA: After the attack of the Crystalline Entity.

DATA: Yes. All of the inhabitants of the colony were killed. However, I

discovered that my memory banks contained the contents of their

journals and logs.

JULIANA: We hoped their experiences would be useful. After your

childhood, we figured you could use all the help you could get.

DATA: My childhood?

JULIANA: That's what I called it. You were like a baby, at first. A

hundred kilogram baby, but still. You had trouble learning your motor

skills, learning how to process sensory information. And of course

Noonian was never satisfied. He kept tinkering, trying to make you as

human as possible.

DATA: So you wiped my memory processors after this childhood.

JULIANA: Then we deactivated you and programmed you with the colonists'

logs. We had planned to reactivate you, but we never got the chance.

That's when the Crystalline Entity attacked. We had to leave quickly.

We wanted to take you with us, but there was only room for two in the

escape pod.

DATA: Doctor, I have scanned the journals of the colonists. There is

only one Juliana mentioned in them. Her last name was O'Donnell.

JULIANA: That's me.

DATA: But there was no mention that my father was married to you.

JULIANA: Because of my mother. She thought that Noonian was an

eccentric scientist who was too old for me. We decided to marry

secretly to give her a chance to get used to our being together. We

slipped away to Mavala Four and got married there. A Klingon and a

Corvallan trader were our witnesses. It wasn't exactly the wedding I'd

hoped for. Somehow Noonian had a way of making even the oddest things

seem romantic.

DATA: My father did have an unusual way of looking at things.

JULIANA: How would you know that?

DATA: I encountered him once in the Terlina system.

JULIANA: That's where we went to after we left the outpost. I had no

idea that you'd even met him.

DATA: It was shortly before his death.

JULIANA: He's dead?

DATA: Yes.

JULIANA: I had no idea it would hit me this hard. We didn't exactly

part on the best of terms.

DATA: What do you mean?

JULIANA: I realised he loved his work as much as he loved me. Maybe

more. There we were, stuck on this planet in the middle of the jungle

with no one else to talk to. No life. It just wasn't enough. That's why

I left. That was all a very, very long time ago. The important thing is

that we're here now together. And I do want to get to know you.

DATA: This has been an interesting encounter, and an altogether

unexpected one. I would like to corroborate your story before we

proceed further. Excuse me, Doctor.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Data, I'm almost finished reconfiguring

the phaser banks. We should be able to start drilling in about an hour.

DATA: Inform me when you are ready.

LAFORGE: What is it you're doing over there?

DATA: I am attempting to ascertain whether Doctor Tainer's story is

true.

LAFORGE: Don't you believe her?

DATA: I neither believe nor doubt. I am simply attempting to verify her

assertions.

LAFORGE: Well, what have you turned up so far?

DATA: The Registrar's Office on Mavala Four cannot confirm whether

Doctor Soong was married there. Apparently many of the documents were

lost when the government was overthrown.

LAFORGE: What's that you're looking at?

DATA: I am checking passenger manifests to see if they went to Mavala

during the period in question. O'Donnell, Juliana. Soong, Noonian. They

were both passengers on a transport which travelled from Omicron Theta

to Mavala and returned four days later.

LAFORGE: That sure fits with her story.

DATA: Still, the fact that they went to Mavala does not prove they were

married there.

LAFORGE: You know, Data, it almost seems to me like you're trying to

prove that Doctor Tainer wasn't telling the truth.

DATA: Not at all. I am merely unable to reconcile her story with the

fact that my father never mentioned her to me.

LAFORGE: Well, she did leave him. Maybe she broke his heart. Maybe he

just didn't want to talk about her. Let me ask you this. Doctor Soong

created an emotion chip. Didn't Lore tell you that chip also contained

memories, memories Soong wanted you to have?

DATA: Yes. It is possible that those are memories of my childhood. And

of Mrs Soong.

LAFORGE: When you think about it, why would she want to lie? Why would

anybody want to pretend to be your mother?

DATA: I can think of no motive for such a pretense.

LAFORGE: And I can understand that this might all be a little

disconcerting for you, Data. It came out of the blue, and it doesn't

fit into your logical processors.

DATA: That is true.

LAFORGE: But that's life, Data. Part of being human is learning how to

deal with the unexpected. To risk new experiences even when they don't

fit into your preconceptions.

DATA: I admit I am finding it difficult to accept the possibility of a

past about which I know nothing. But it is also true that I am curious

to learn more about it.

[Ten Forward]

(Juliana is having a meal when Data walks up to her

table)

JULIANA: Data?

DATA: I would like to get to know you better, Mother.

[Corridor]

JULIANA: I wanted to make you female, but your

father insisted on a son. We argued about it endlessly, right up until

we were ready to assemble you.

DATA: How did you decide?

JULIANA: Noonian walked in with your head in his hand and, innocent as

you please, said it was up to me. He knew perfectly well what he was

doing. Once again he had made it in his own image. What could I

possibly say? (reads door name plate) Deanna Troi, is that who you're

going to visit?

DATA: Yes.

JULIANA: Your father would be so pleased.

DATA: Pleased?

JULIANA: He was worried that the sexuality programme he designed for

you wouldn't work.

DATA: You misunderstand. Counsellor Troi is a therapist.

JULIANA: Goodnight.

[Engineering]

DATA: We will be in position over the drilling site

in three minutes twenty nine seconds.

(Juliana rests her hand on his shoulder)

DATA: These scans indicate that the magma pockets where we plan to set

up the infusion units are somewhat unstable.

JULIANA: I'm going to monitor the density of the rock layers and adjust

the strength of the particle beam as we go. That should minimise the

seismic stress that we generate while we're drilling.

LAFORGE: Data, I reconfigured the phasers to create the most highly

focused particle beam possible.

DATA: Thank you, Geordi.

JULIANA: I'm just so pleased you've got good manners. It wasn't easy to

strike the right balance with your programming. At first you couldn't

have cared less about the social niceties like please and thank you.

You were downright rude, in fact.

LAFORGE: Data? That's hard to picture.

JULIANA: That was nothing to the problems we encountered. Never mind. I

don't want to embarrass you.

DATA: I am incapable of embarrassment. Please continue.

JULIANA: Well, the one thing we couldn't anticipate was that you didn't

seem to mind about being naked. Some of the colonists objected to

having an anatomically correct android running around without any

clothes on. We asked you to dress, but you didn't feel it was necessary

because you didn't suffer from the elements. We actually had to write a

modesty sub-routine to get you to keep your clothes on.

RIKER [OC]: Bridge to Engineering.

LAFORGE: La Forge here. Go ahead, Commander.

RIKER [OC]: We've established a synchronous orbit over the drilling

site.

LAFORGE: Phaser modifications are online, sir.

DATA: My calculations indicate

[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: The first phaser blast will be

approximately nineteen seconds in duration.

RIKER: Acknowledged.

PRAN: Someone's checked his calculations, of course.

RIKER: No, but I'm sure Mister Data knows what he's doing.

PRAN: Even so, he is a machine. Someone should check up on him.

RIKER: I have complete confidence in Mister Data's ability to check up

on himself. Mister Worf?

WORF: Phasers locked on target.

RIKER: Fire when ready.

[Engineering]

DATA: We are within two kilometres of the magma

pocket.

JULIANA: Another five seconds should do it. We've broken through.

[Bridge]

WORF: Terminating the beam.

[Engineering]

JULIANA: The pocket seems stable.

DATA: I detect no increase in the stress levels of the surrounding

magma.

RIKER [OC]: Good work, Data.

[Bridge]

RIKER: I don't think we could have gotten it any

cleaner.

JULIANA [OC]: We have Data to thank for that. I couldn't have done it

without him. His figures were perfect.

[Engineering]

DATA: The drilling process has raised the

temperature in the magma pockets by almost three hundred degrees

Celsius. It will be several hours before it cools enough for us to

enter.

JULIANA: Data, do you have any plans right now?

DATA: I do not.

JULIANA: Maybe we should spend a little time together? I'd love to see

your quarters.

[Data's quarters]

(Data plays violin for her. Juliana applauds)

DATA: Thank you. I will be playing this piece at a recital tomorrow

evening.

JULIANA: That was beautiful.

DATA: I have been told that my playing is technically flawless, but no

one has described it as beautiful.

JULIANA: It was, really.

DATA: Are you certain you are not saying this because you are my

mother? I have noticed that parents tend to exaggerate when it comes to

their children's accomplishments.

JULIANA: I suppose there's a certain amount of vanity involved,

considering that giving you a creative aspect was my idea. Your father

didn't really see the point. He thought that since you didn't have

emotions, there would be no real need for you to express yourself.

Somehow I had the feeling the opposite would be true.

DATA: I do not know for certain, but I believe it is during my creative

endeavours that I come closest to experiencing what it must be like to

be human.

JULIANA: Well, I'm glad I insisted.

DATA: As am I.

JULIANA: Data, I'm very familiar with that Handel piece. How would you

feel about my playing the viola part tomorrow?

DATA: I would like that very much.

JULIANA: I'll have to practice. You don't have a viola?

DATA: I could replicate one for you. Computer, please replicate one

viola.

JULIANA: Did you paint these?

DATA: Yes. I am attempting to master all known styles of painting. This

one is in the style of the early French impressionists.

JULIANA: It's very good. Who's this?

DATA: That is Lal, my daughter.

JULIANA: Your daughter?

DATA: I created her, using myself as a model.

JULIANA: Where is she now?

DATA: The positronic matrix I designed for her was unstable. She only

lived a short time.

JULIANA: I see.

DATA: In a sense, you were her grandmother. Would you like to practice

now?

JULIANA: Yes. Yes, of course.

[Ten Forward]

(the place is empty so they are practising here)

DATA: The acoustics in Ten Forward are most favourable.

JULIANA: Yes, yes, very nice. Data, may I ask you something?

DATA: Of course.

JULIANA: Do you think you'll ever try to create an android again?

DATA: Perhaps. I created Lal because I wished to procreate. Despite

what happened to her, I still have that wish.

JULIANA: How do you know the same thing won't happen? Creating a stable

positronic matrix is very tricky. Your father lost several prototypes

before Lore.

DATA: I was not aware he created other androids before my brother.

JULIANA: There were three of them. They were like children to us.

Losing them was very painful. When Noonian decided to try again, I was

very much against it. I didn't think we had the right to bring a life

into the world with so little chance of surviving. But your Father was

sure that he'd figured out what went wrong, insisted he could make a

stable matrix, and he did. But Lore was cruel. Evil. Eventually we had

no choice, we had to dismantle him. Your father decided to build yet

another android, one who didn't have emotions. I couldn't believe he

would want to try again.

DATA: I am that android. Are you saying you were against my creation?

JULIANA: Initially I was. But I was wrong, I know that now. I've

followed your progress for years. I'm very proud of what you've

accomplished.

DATA: Then why did you never attempt to contact me?

JULIANA: Because I felt guilty about something I'd done.

DATA: Perhaps if you told me what has made you feel this way, it may

alleviated the guilt.

JULIANA: I lied. When I said there was no room for you in the escape

pod that we took from Omicron. There was. I didn't want to bring you

with us. I was afraid if we reactivated you, you'd turn out like Lore.

I made Noonian leave you behind.

[Engineering]

DATA: We are within four kilometres of the magma

pocket.

(the ship starts shaking)

LAFORGE: We're picking up feedback pulses along the particle beam.

JULIANA: We must have hit a pocket of magnesite ore. I'll try to adjust

the phaser harmonics to compensate.

RIKER [OC]: Data, we're going to have to terminate the beam if this

keeps up.

DATA: If we do, we will have to begin a new shaft at a suitable

location.

JULIANA: There is no other suitable location. Just give me a few more

seconds.

LAFORGE: Doctor, it's going to take longer than that to match the

(the shaking stops)

LAFORGE: You did it.

JULIANA: It was just luck I hit the right frequency. All right, we're

less than two kilometres away from the target site. Stand by to

terminate the beam.

LAFORGE: We've broken through.

JULIANA: Now.

DATA: I am detecting no signs of

[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: Instability.

PRAN: Commander, may I suggest we set up the infusion unit in the first

magma pocket and give this one a chance to cool.

RIKER: Data

[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: Doctor Tainer, we'll meet you in

transporter room two.

DATA: Acknowledged.

[Magma pocket]

(a nice big cave with a lovely flat floor)

DATA: I have initialised the plasma induction coils.

JULIANA: I'll need another minute to align the diverter.

(Data is watching Juliana very carefully)

PRAN: There are signs of stress in the surrounding magma, but the site

should remain stable until we finish the plasma infusion.

JULIANA: Good, we're almost done here.

PRAN: Data, Juliana told me what she said to you last night. She's been

very upset. I don't blame you for being angry with her

DATA: I am incapable of anger.

JULIANA: It's all right, Pran. I know what I said to you must have been

hard to hear, but I hope you understand my reasons.

DATA: I am not certain I do. Perhaps you could clarify them for me?

JULIANA: Well, I'll try. What do you want to know?

DATA: If I had been your biological offspring, would you have left me

on Omicron Theta?

JULIANA: Oh, Data, how can I answer that?

DATA: Doctor Tainer, I get the impression you are trying to spare my

feelings. I assure you that is not necessary.

JULIANA: I just don't want you to misunderstand my answer. No, I

wouldn't have left you behind if you'd been my biological child.

DATA: Is that because you place more value on biological life than on

artificial life?

JULIANA: Absolutely not. I cherished every android your father and I

created as if it were my child. Even Lore. Despite the fact that he

turned on us, despite the dreadful things he did, dismantling him was

the most difficult thing I ever had to do. I was afraid that if you

turned out like him I would have to dismantle you, too. And I couldn't

bear to do that. I'm not trying to justify leaving you behind. I'm just

sorry I did. I hope you believe me.

DATA: I do. Thank you for making it clear to me.

[Ten Forward]

(Data and Juliana finish their recital to applause)

AUDIENCE: Bravo, bravo.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Data, why do you want to look at Doctor

Tainer's medical records? Is something wrong with her?

DATA: I was hoping you would be able to determine that from her

transporter trace pattern.

CRUSHER: Well, probably I could, but ordinarily I don't check

somebody's medical status without a good reason.

DATA: Doctor, I would ask that you not require me to be more specific.

I assure you, I have a good reason for asking.

CRUSHER: All right, Data. At first glance I see nothing wrong with her.

Except for a mild case of hypertension, which is normal for a woman her

age.

DATA: I see.

CRUSHER: Maybe you should tell me what her symptoms are.

DATA: She has not complained of any discomfort.

CRUSHER: Then why do you want to see her medical records?

DATA: Because I have reason to believe she is not who she claims to be.

RIKER [OC]: Bridge to Data.

DATA: Go ahead, sir.

RIKER [OC]: There's been a cave-in in one of the magma pockets. You're

needed in transporter room two.

DATA: On my way. Excuse me, Doctor.

[Transporter room]

(Juliana and Data enter)

JULIANA: What happened?

(Pran is injured)

PRAN: We were running a final check on the infusion units when a part

of the wall gave way.

LAFORGE: It looks like the area has stabilised, but seismic stress is

building up. Eventually, the pocket will collapse.

RIKER [OC]: How long, Geordi?

LAFORGE: It's tough to tell, Commander. Twelve hours at most.

JULIANA: Then we must finish configuring the unit and inject the plasma

immediately.

[Bridge]

RIKER: I'd rather not send anyone back down there.

JULIANA [OC]: If you don't do it

[Transporter room]

JULIANA: Now, Commander, it may take months to find

another suitable site. The core may solidify by then.

PRAN: She's right, we have to act now.

RIKER [OC]: All right, but I want you in and out of there as quickly as

possible.

DATA: Acknowledged.

JULIANA: You're hurt. I'll go.

[Magma pocket]

(Data is standing up the pattern enhancers and

scanning the area when a quake strikes)

DATA: There will be more seismic activity. We must hurry.

(Data and Juliana go along a passage to where the equipment is set up)

DATA: The shaft has not been obstructed by the seismic activity. It

should be possible to trigger the unit from orbit.

JULIANA: The infuser's been damaged. We're going to have to start the

programming sequence all over again.

DATA: Priming the energy-transfer matrix.

JULIANA: Re-initialising the particle stream buffer.

RIKER [OC]: Riker to Data. Are you there?

DATA: Go ahead, sir.

RIKER [OC]: We're reading an increase in seismic stress levels.

DATA: Understood, sir. We will attempt to expedite our work.

JULIANA: There. Now we just have to re-align the diverter.

(another quake rocks the chamber)

RIKER [OC]: Data, are you all right?

DATA: Yes, sir. We'll be returning to the beam-out point shortly.

JULIANA: That's it. Let's go.

(they go down the passage and discover everything has fallen down into

a pit)

JULIANA: Can we transport without the pattern enhancers?

DATA: No, we are too far below the surface.

JULIANA: How are we going to get down there?

DATA: There are no handholds in the rock face. We are going to have to

jump.

JULIANA: No, it's too far! I won't make it!

DATA: You will.

(Data takes Juliana's arm and makes her jump with him. She lands badly,

is knocked out, and her arm has fallen off. It is artificial.)

[Sickbay]

(Geordi has got Juliana's forehead open)

LAFORGE: Basically she's a Soong-type android, except everything about

her is designed to fool you into thinking she's human.

CRUSHER: She's got tear ducts, sweat glands, even veins and capillaries

underneath her skin.

RIKER: Why does the scanner read her as a human?

CRUSHER: Because she has a feedback processor designed to send out a

false bio-signal.

LAFORGE: It's part of her aging programme. Not only does she age in

appearance like Data, her vital signs change too.

CRUSHER: What I can't figure out is why she lost consciousness. As far

as I can see, everything is fine. She should be awake.

DATA: Check her positronic matrix. There may be a cascade anomaly.

RIKER: You said you knew she was an android. How?

DATA: The first indication occurred when we were digging. I saw her

perform complex calculations without the assistance of the computer.

RIKER: That could have just meant she was good at math.

DATA: That is true, but it was enough to get my attention. Later, I

noticed something odd about the way she blinked her eyes. The intervals

between blinks were governed by the Fourier system, the same

mathematical formula my father used to give my blinking pattern the

appearance of randomness.

RIKER: Only you could have noticed something like that.

DATA: Then there was the concert in Ten Forward.

RIKER: What about it?

DATA: We had practised the piece, and I noticed that she played it the

same way during the performance. Every pitch, every intonation, was

exactly the same. Only an artificial life form could have done that.

RIKER: Does her husband know anything about this?

DATA: I do not believe so. He is on the surface monitoring the plasma

infusion.

RIKER: Probably just as well.

LAFORGE: Data, come take a look at this.

DATA: It appears to be an information module. With a holographic

interface.

[Holodeck]

(Data puts Juliana's chip into a holder, then into

the holodeck arch panel)

SOONG: Whoever you are, you must have found out about Juliana.

DATA: That is correct.

SOONG: I programmed this hologram to answer any questions you might

have. I am Noonian Soong. I created her.

DATA: I am Data.

SOONG: Data? I hoped somehow it might be you. I even created a response

programme to answer your questions. How are you, boy?

DATA: I am fine.

SOONG: I'm glad you got the chance to meet your mother.

DATA: You refer to Doctor Tainer as my mother, yet the complexity of

her design indicates she was created after I was.

SOONG: You're right. But there was a real Juliana O'Donnell. She was my

wife. She helped me create you.

DATA: What happened to her?

SOONG: She was injured when the Crystalline Entity attacked. We made it

as far as Terlina Three but, she slipped into a coma. When I realised

nothing could be done for her, I built an android. I tried to perfect

my synaptic scanning technique so that I could transfer Juliana's

memories into a positronic matrix. I didn't know if it would work, but

I had to try. I couldn't stand the thought of losing the only woman I

ever loved. A few days after Juliana died, I activated the android. She

looked up at me and smiled. She recognised me. It had worked! Here was

a life not two minutes old, and as far as she knew I was her husband.

She'd just recovered from a terrible injury. It was incredible.

DATA: Then you never told her the truth?

SOONG: Why? There was no reason for her to know. I wanted her to be

happy. I wanted us to be happy. We were. For a while.

DATA: What happened?

SOONG: I made a terrible mistake. I never really let her know how much

I loved her. So she left me. The real Juliana probably would have left

too, if she'd lived.

DATA: If she recovers and learns that she is an android

SOONG: She doesn't have to know. I designed her to shut down in the

event the truth was discovered. When you put that chip back in, she

will wake up and remember nothing. All you have to do is make up some

excuse about what happened to her.

DATA: Then you do not believe she should know the truth?

SOONG: Truth? The truth is, in every way that matters, she is Juliana

Soong. I programmed her to terminate after a long life. Let her live

out her days, and die believing she was human. Don't rob her of that,

son. Please.

[Observation lounge]

DATA: It seems that I must make a decision. Whether

to tell Doctor Tainer that she is an android or to withhold that

information from her. I do not know what to do.

CRUSHER: Why was Doctor Soong so adamant that she not be told?

DATA: He seemed certain that if she knew, it would preclude the

possibility of her being happy.

PICARD: Data, what do you think?

DATA: I am not certain. I understand why my father felt as he did, but

his wishes are not necessarily paramount. I am more concerned with what

would be best for her.

CRUSHER: Wouldn't she be better off knowing the truth? Dealing with the

reality of her existence?

TROI: I don't think so. She's believed she's human all her life. The

truth might be devastating to her.

PICARD: Data, there might come some time in the future when she would

find out anyway. Another accident, perhaps. Maybe it would be easier

for her if she learned the truth from you.

CRUSHER: I can tell you that if I were in her place, I would rather be

told by my son than by some stranger.

DATA: I find I am having difficulty separating what would be best for

her from what would be best for me.

TROI: What do you mean?

DATA: If she knew she were an android, we would have something to

share. I would no longer be alone in the universe.

TROI: I know how much that means to you, Data, but at the same time, by

telling her you're robbing her of the one thing you've wanted all your

life. To be human.

PICARD: It's a difficult choice. You must do what you think best, Data.

But whatever decision you make, we will support it.

[Sickbay]

(Data puts the chip back in her head and covers it

over with her hair. She wakes.)

JULIANA: Data? What happened? The last thing I remember is jumping off

a cliff.

DATA: You were knocked unconscious by the fall. You broke a bone in

your arm, but Doctor Crusher repaired it. Everything is fine.

Captain's log, supplemental. The infusion of plasma

into the core of Atrea Four has been accomplished. The core should

remain molten for several hundred years.

[Transporter room]

JULIANA: When will I see you again?

DATA: Perhaps I can visit Atrea on my next leave.

JULIANA: I would like that very much. Well, I'd better be going.

DATA: There is something I thought you should know. My father told me

that he had only one great love in his life and that he regretted never

telling her how much he cared for her. I am certain he was referring to

you.

JULIANA: That's nice to know. On Atrea there is a saying, that a child

born from parents who love each other will have nothing but goodness in

his heart. I guess that explains you. Take care of yourself, son.

DATA: Goodbye, Mother. Energise.

Original Airdate: 29 Nov, 1993

  [Shuttlecraft]

WORF: Personal log, stardate 47391.2. I am

returning from the Bat'leth competition on Forcas Three. The conditions

were difficult. Several contenders were maimed. But I was triumphant. I

won Champion Standing. I am looking forward to resuming my duties

aboard the Enterprise. However, I am anticipating a troubling

situation.

[Corridor]

(Worf keeps looking around for something)

RIKER: It looks like we're going to have to head into to the Argus

Array. This is the third time this year it's stopped relaying data.

Starfleet's beginning to think it's more than a simple malfunction. I

want you to start a long range scan once we get. Lieutenant? Are you

listening to me?

WORF: Hmm? Yes, sir.

RIKER: You seem awfully tense for a man who just came back from

vacation.

WORF: Today is my birthday.

[Worf's quarters]

RIKER: What's the matter with you?

WORF: Because it is my birthday I assumed that you or one of the others

would try to mount an unexpected social gathering.

RIKER: A surprise party? Mister Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would

never do that to you.

WORF: I am sorry, Commander.

RIKER: Settle in. I'll meet you on the Bridge.

WORF: Aye sir.

(Riker leaves, Worf puts down his bat'leth and trophy and walks through

to)

ALL: Surprise!!

(Riker returns and puts a twee party hat on Worf)

RIKER: I love surprise parties.

(after the opening titles, seventeen or so candles are lit on the

chocolate

cake, and to the tune of For He's A Jolly Good Fellow)

ALL: Cha Worf Toh'gah nah lo Pre'tOk. Cha Worf Toh'gah nah lo Pre'tOk.

Cha Worf Toh'gah nah lo Pre'tOk. Tu Mak Dagh Cha doh Borak!

(Worf blows out the candles)

WORF: That was not a Klingon song.

TROI: It wasn't easy to translate. There doesn't seem to be a Klingon

word for jolly.

CRUSHER: It's traditional for the birthday boy to cut the cake.

RIKER: Captain Picard sends his birthday wishes. He was needed on the

Bridge.

(Worf cuts a huge slice of soft cake)

DATA: Happy birthday, Worf.

WORF: Thank you.

(Worf opens the present)

WORF: Ah. A painting.

DATA: Yes. I have entered my Expressionistic phase. This is my

interpretation of the Battle of HarOS.

WORF: The Battle of HarOS?

TROI: I think it's wonderful. And I know just where to put it.

WORF: What are you doing?

(Riker takes down the brass shield, and Troi hangs the big bright

canvas to the left of the door)

TROI: I always thought this room could use a little more colour.

LAFORGE: Nice. The Battle of HarOS, right?

(Worf sways)

LAFORGE: Worf, are you all right?

WORF: Yes, Yes, I think Data's painting is making me dizzy.

CRUSHER: Some cake?

LAFORGE: Thank you, Doctor.

(the inside of the cake is yellow)

WORF: I thought the cake was chocolate.

TROI: Don't I wish. This is from Alexander. He gave it me just before

he left to visit your parents. (takes cake) Thank you.

(Worf unwraps a plaster cast)

LAFORGE: What is it, Worf?

WORF: It is a cast of Alexander's forehead. The ridges of a warrior.

TROI: He wished he could have been here when you got back from shore

leave. You should have seen him, Worf. He stayed up all night talking

about how proud he was of his father.

WORF: Thank you for watching him while I was away.

TROI: Oh, it was my pleasure.

PICARD: So, how old are you, Mister Worf?

WORF: Captain, I was told you could not attend.

PICARD: (tucking into cake) I wouldn't miss this for the world. How old

are you?

WORF: I am old enough.

[Bridge]

(they've arrived at the array)

PICARD: Report.

DATA: The Array appears to be functioning normally, sir.

RIKER: That can't be right. We were told the Array stopped relaying

data six days ago.

DATA: The Array is still transmitting data, sir, but it is no longer

sending that information to the Federation. It appears someone has

redirected its imaging systems.

PICARD: Where is the information being sent now?

DATA: Sector one nine six five eight, sir. I am unable to access it's

main computer, so it is impossible to determine the exact location.

RIKER: What's in that sector?

WORF: It is uninhabited. But there could be a ship or a subspace relay

station receiving the data.

RIKER: Captain. I suggest we beam a repair crew aboard the Array. We

can begin downloading their imaging logs, find out what the Array's

been observing for the past six days.

PICARD: Make it so.

RIKER: Mister Data?

[Ten Forward]

WORF: Excuse me, Counsellor. Do you have a moment?

TROI: Of course.

WORF: I have been meaning to speak with you about Alexander.

TROI: Oh?

WORF: It has never been easy for me having Alexander on board. I have

always tried to be a good father, to give him guidance, but he seems to

have his own mind about some things.

TROI: Most children do.

WORF: I could not have come this far without your help. Alexander looks

up to you. At times, I have felt that you are like a mother to him.

TROI: Worf, that's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.

WORF: One time when I thought I was going to die, I asked you to watch

over Alexander. I was wondering if you might consider formalising that

arrangement. I want you to be Alexander's Soh-chIm.

TROI: His Soh-chIm?

WORF: You would become his surrogate mother. In case anything ever

happened to me, you would be responsible for him.

TROI: I don't know what to say. It's a great honour. So, that would

make me your?

WORF: The closest analogy is step-sister.

TROI: That would make my mother your step-mother.

WORF: I had not considered that. It is a risk I am willing to take.

TROI: I accept.

DATA [OC]: Lieutenant Worf, please report to Engineering.

WORF: I am on my way.

[Engineering]

DATA: We have analysed the imaging logs. It appears

the Array was reprogrammed to observe several Federation sites.

LAFORGE: This is Deep Space Five. Starbase Forty seven. The Iadara

Colony and the Utopia Planitia Shipyards.

PICARD: They're responsible for new starship development.

WORF: Someone is using the Array for covert surveillance of the

Federation.

DATA: That is our theory. We believe unauthorised access was made six

days ago. The imaging logs from that day show a ship approaching the

Array.

WORF: That's a Cardassian ship. Galor Class.

LAFORGE: We're only three light years from Cardassian space. They would

have easy access to the Array.

PICARD: Mister Worf, start a long range scan of the region. See if

there are any Cardassian ships nearby.

WORF: Aye sir.

LAFORGE: Worf, here's a propulsion analysis of the Cardassian ship. You

might try scanning for its energy configuration.

(Worf has a dizzy moment and Data supports him)

DATA: Lieutenant, are you all right?

WORF: I feel dizzy.

(it's now Geordi supporting the swaying Worf. Picard is missing)

LAFORGE: Worf, you don't look so good. Maybe you ought to go to

Sickbay.

WORF: Yes. Yes, perhaps I will.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Any nausea or blurred vision?

WORF: No. However, I did experience some dizziness earlier today at my

birthday celebration.

CRUSHER: Sounds like you're having some of the side effects from the

concussion. I can give you some vertazine for the dizziness but I'd

like you to rest.

WORF: Doctor, perhaps you are thinking of another patient. I have no

concussion.

CRUSHER: Worf, you came in here this morning complaining of ringing in

your ears. I scanned you. You had a concussion. You don't remember any

of this?

WORF: No.

CRUSHER: Temporary memory loss is common for this kind of injury. Do

you remember telling me about the Bat'leth tournament? You said that

one of the competitors hit you over the head. That's why you lost the

match.

WORF: I won that tournament. And I can prove it to you.

[Worf's quarters]

(the trophy is smaller)

CRUSHER: What's wrong?

WORF: It says ninth place. This is not the same trophy. Someone is

playing a trick on me.

CRUSHER: Worf, try to stay calm. Memory loss can be very disorienting.

WORF: The log. I recorded a personal log on my way back to the

Enterprise. Computer, access personal logs on Shuttlecraft Curie. Show

my log entry for Stardate 47391.2.

WORF [on monitor]: Personal log, stardate 47391.2. I am returning from

the Bat'leth competition on Forcas Three. The conditions were

difficult. Several contenders were maimed. One of the contenders used

an illegal T'gha manoeuvre against me. The judges chose to ignore it

and I was robbed of my rightful standing. I was awarded ninth place. I

am looking forward to resuming my duties aboard the En

WORF: I do not understand.

CRUSHER: Worf, I'm sure this is very disturbing for you, but don't

worry, your memories will return. The best thing you could do right now

is to settle back into your normal routine, but slowly.

WORF: Thank you, Doctor.

CRUSHER: Let me know if you have any more problems with dizziness. I'll

give you a hypospray.

[Bridge]

DATA: Lieutenant, have you completed the

metallurgical scan of the Array?

WORF: Sir?

DATA: The metallurgical scan. Have you completed it?

WORF: I do not remember you asking me to. Captain, there is a

Cardassian ship approaching. Galor Class.

PICARD: Open a channel.

WORF: On screen.

PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. You

are in Federation territory. Please explain your presence here.

NADOR [on viewscreen]: We were wondering the same thing about you,

Captain. Why would Starfleet's flagship want to venture so close to the

Cardassian border?

PICARD: We are repairing one of our subspace telescopes.

NADOR [on viewscreen]: I see. May we offer our assistance?

PICARD: No, thank you. Everything is under control.

NADOR [on viewscreen]: If you don't mind my asking, what exactly is

this telescope of yours designed to do?

PICARD: It's a long range subspace Array. We use it for gathering data

on astronomical phenomena.

NADOR [on viewscreen]: I'm certain it would never be used to observe a

neighbouring species.

PICARD: Certainly not.

NADOR [on viewscreen]: Well then, best of luck with your repairs. Just

try to make certain that your studies are limited to astronomical

phenomena.

(transmission ends)

RIKER: Charming fellow.

WORF: Captain, that ship was responsible for reprogramming the Array.

PICARD: What are you saying?

WORF: It is the same class and energy configuration as the ship we saw

in the imaging logs.

PICARD: The imaging logs? Are you suggesting that you have evidence the

Cardassians have tampered with the Array?

WORF: They are using the Array as a surveillance device. You saw the

logs yourself.

PICARD: I haven't heard anything about this.

RIKER: Neither have I.

WORF: Commander Data, show them the logs you downloaded from the Array.

DATA: I know of no such logs.

PICARD: Mister Worf, are you feeling all right?

WORF: Yes.

PICARD: Mister Data, perhaps you had better re-examine the Array. See

if you can find any evidence to support Mister Worf's claims.

[Worf's quarters]

WORF: Doctor Crusher says I am experiencing further

memory loss, but my instincts tell me it is more than that. I remember

those imaging logs. I could tell you every detail, every word.

TROI: (in a fetching off the shoulder blue number) Worf, let's assume

for a second you're right, that things did happen as you remember them.

Are you saying that everyone's memory on this ship has been altered but

yours?

(doorbell)

WORF: Enter.

LAFORGE: Counsellor. Worf, I wanted you to know that we re-examined the

imaging logs. They don't show a Cardassian ship or any evidence that

the Array was reprogrammed. From what we can tell, the Array suffered a

simple mechanical failure.

WORF: That is not right. I was certain that

(Worf has a dizzy spell, and Data's painting moves walls)

TROI: What's wrong?

WORF: Counsellor, the painting that Commander Data gave me. It has

moved.

TROI: Worf, I hung that painting there. At your birthday party,

remember?

WORF: No.

(the painting is now a battlecruiser)

WORF: The painting has changed. Don't you see it?

(Troi is now in uniform)

WORF: Your hair and your clothing, they have changed as well.

LAFORGE: Worf, maybe you should come with me to Sickbay and

[Bridge]

(blink and they are at red alert with a Cardassian

ship bearing down on them)

PICARD: Now, Mister Worf! Now!

RIKER: What are you waiting for? Raise the shields.

(the tactical station has a raised box behind the Captain's chair)

WORF: This panel configuration has been altered. I do not know how

(Boom)

DATA: Direct hit. Engineering Section and deck forty two. Shield

generators are overloading.

(Boom)

PICARD: Number One.

RIKER: (taking over tactical) Firing photon torpedoes. Full spread.

RIKER: Direct hit on their main reactor. They're returning fire.

(Boom)

DATA: Captain, we have sustained heavy damage to the deflector systems.

Hull breaches on decks seventeen and thirty six.

PICARD: Ensign, take us out of here, maximum warp.

GATES: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Are they pursuing us?

RIKER: No, sir. They are firing on the Argus Array. They destroyed it,

sir.

PICARD: Bridge to Engineering. Mister La Forge, what's your status?

HAYES [OC]: This is Ensign Hayes, sir. Commander La Forge has been

taken to Sickbay with plasma burns. There's serious damage to the

secondary plasma conduit but I think we've got it under control.

PICARD: Acknowledged. Ensign, lay in a course to Starbase one two nine.

GATES: Aye, sir.

PICARD: What happened back there, Lieutenant?

WORF: I believe I experienced another memory loss.

RIKER: Memory loss? What are you talking about?

WORF: I do not feel well. Request to be temporarily relieved of duty,

sir.

PICARD: Granted.

[Worf's quarters]

(Worf locks the door behind him. The battleship

painting is back by the door and the trophy is now a vase of flowers)

WORF: Computer, access personal logs on Shuttlecraft Curie. Play log

entry for stardate 47391.2.

COMPUTER: There is no log entry from the Shuttlecraft Curie for that

stardate.

WORF: Computer, display any log entries regarding the Bat'leth

tournament on Forcas Three.

WORF [on monitor]: Personal log, stardate 47391.2. There has been a

malfunction in the ship's main deflector. It will require two more days

of repairs. As a result, I will not be able to compete in the Bat'leth

tournament on Forcas Three. I have asked my brother to take my place.

He does not have my prowess with the blade, but

(doorbell)

TROI: Why'd you lock the door?

WORF: Why shouldn't I?

TROI: I heard what happened on the Bridge. Are you all right?

WORF: I am not sure.

TROI: Do you want to talk about it?

WORF: I would rather not, Counsellor.

TROI: Very well, Lieutenant. Hot chocolate.

WORF: Is there something I can do for you?

TROI: Actually, there is.

(she goes and sits on the bed)

TROI: Come and sit down. I just want you to relax for a minute. (she

unties his ponytail) There. (she massages his shoulders) You are so

tense. Now, I know you don't want to talk about what happened on the

Bridge, but there are times when it's just best to let things out. Come

on. If you can't talk to me, who can you talk to?

(Troi nuzzles his neck, and he leaps away)

WORF: I do not believe this is appropriate behaviour!

TROI: Even for your wife?

WORF: Wife?

TROI: Worf, what's wrong?

WORF: I do not know. Things are changing.

TROI: What's changed?

WORF: I do not remember us, you and I, being mates. It is as if events,

circumstances, continue to change from moment to moment, but I am the

only one who seems to be aware of it.

TROI: Are you saying you don't remember the last three years? You don't

remember us falling in love and getting married?

WORF: I do remember the last three years, but they were different. We

did not have this relationship. We were friends. And the Enterprise did

not have a battle with the Cardassians. And no one believes me.

TROI: Whatever's wrong, whatever happened, I want you to know that I

believe you. And that I love you. And together we'll find out what's

happening.

[Engineering]

DATA: I am initiating a subspace scan to search for

temporal anomalies on or off the ship.

OGAWA [OC]: Counsellor Troi, please report to Sickbay.

TROI: I'm on my way. Let me know if you find anything.

WORF: Commander, how long have I been married to Counsellor Troi?

DATA: (with blue eyes) Two years, one month and twelve days.

WORF: And when did this relationship begin?

DATA: It is my understanding your romantic affiliation began shortly

after you recovered from your spinal injury on stardate 45587. It was

six months later that you asked Commander Riker for his formal

permission to court Counsellor Troi. You felt to do otherwise would be

dishonourable.

WORF: And then we mated?

DATA: I am not privy to the exact details of when, where or how your

first coupling took place. I could investigate it

WORF: No, that is all right.

DATA: I am detecting no temporal anomalies in this system. Perhaps we

should try to pinpoint the exact moment when events became

discontinuous. Do you remember the first change?

WORF: I was in Sickbay. Doctor Crusher told me I had a concussion but I

do not remember that happening.

DATA: Think back. Are you sure that was the very first change?

WORF: Before. Yes. Yes, I was in Engineering. I felt a wave of

dizziness and when I looked up, you and Commander La Forge were on the

opposite side of the room. Captain Picard was gone. I thought I had

blacked out for a moment and had not observed your movements. And at my

birthday party, the cake was chocolate and then it was yellow. And

Commander Riker told me Captain Picard was not going to attend, and

then suddenly he was there.

DATA: We should try to find the commonalties in these events. Where

were the people you were with?

WORF: Everyone was at my birthday party. Then I was with Counsellor

Troi, then Commander La Forge came in. Geordi. Geordi was present at

all three locations. And he was near me in each case just before I

noticed the differences. There has to be a connection.

DATA: It is possible. We should speak to Commander La Forge.

[Sickbay]

DATA: Doctor, is Geordi well enough to answer some

questions?

OGAWA: (the Doctor) Geordi's dead.

DATA: There do not appear to be any unusual readings. Energy residuals

from the plasma burns, the beginnings of cellular decomposition. I see

nothing that connects these bio-readings to your recent sense of

discontinuity.

OGAWA: What about his visor?

DATA: I still see nothing unusual. Perhaps we should activate it.

OGAWA: Hook it up to the diagnostic array and I'll check it out.

DATA: The visor is active.

(Worf is in red, with three pips and a future comm. badge. He sways.)

CRUSHER: Worf, are you alright?

DATA: (yellow eyes) Have you noticed another discontinuity?

WORF: Doctor Crusher was not here. Doctor Ogawa was.

CRUSHER: Doctor Ogawa?

WORF: My uniform has changed. What is my rank and position?

TROI: You're a Commander and First Officer.

WORF: Are we still married?

TROI: Yes.

DATA: I am detecting a quantum flux in your cellular RNA.

WORF: What does that mean?

DATA: I do not know. I will have to analyse these readings.

[Ready room]

(Riker is Captain)

DATA: I have found the quantum flux in Worf's cellular RNA extends to

the subatomic level. It is asynchronous with normal matter. In essence,

Captain, Mister Worf does not belong in our universe.

RIKER: What?

DATA: All matter in the universe resonates on a quantum level with a

unique signature. That signature is constant. It cannot be changed

through any known process. It is the basic foundation of existence.

RIKER: Are you saying that Worf's quantum signature is different from

ours?

DATA: Yes, sir. I cannot explain it. It is as if he originates from a

different quantum universe.

RIKER: Mister Worf, you say the discontinuities started to occur after

you returned from a Bat'leth tournament on Forcas Three.

WORF: Yes, sir.

RIKER: Now, I know for a fact that you never attended that tournament

and that no shuttlecraft has left the Enterprise for over a month.

WORF: I understand that, but I also clearly remember attending the

tournament and returning to the ship in a shuttlecraft.

RIKER: Do you remember the route you took to return?

WORF: Yes.

RIKER: Let's backtrack that course. See if there are any unusual

readings or anomalies.

DATA: Aye, sir.

(Data leaves)

WORF: If I may inquire, sir, how long have you been Captain of the

Enterprise?

RIKER: Four years. Ever since Captain Picard was killed in the incident

with the Borg. You don't remember any of this, do you?

WORF: I do remember. I just remember differently.

[Bridge]

(Wesley's back and at Tactical, and there are

architecture differences)

WESLEY: Captain, I'm picking up a minor subspace disturbance off the

port bow.

RIKER: Full stop.

HELM: (a Cardassian) Aye, sir.

RIKER: Analysis, Mister Data.

DATA: It appears to be a quantum fissure in the space-time continuum.

RIKER: On screen.

DATA: The anomaly cannot be seen, but I believe I can enhance it with a

warp field to make it visible.

(a blue glow appears)

RIKER: Is it dangerous?

DATA: Not from this distance, sir. I am also detecting an ion trail

intersecting the phenomenon. I believe it was left by a Starfleet type

six shuttlecraft.

WORF: So I was here.

DATA: I have an explanation, sir.

[Observation lounge]

DATA: I believe the quantum fissure we discovered

is a fixed point across the space time continuum. A keyhole which

intersects many other quantum realities.

TROI: What do you mean, quantum realities?

DATA: For any event, there is an infinite number of possible outcomes.

Our choices determine which outcomes will follow. But there is a theory

in quantum physics that all possibilities that can happen, do happen in

alternate quantum realities.

WORF: And somehow I have been shifting from one reality to another.

DATA: That is correct.

TROI: How did this happen?

DATA: When Worf's shuttlecraft came into contact with the quantum

fissure, I believe its warp engines caused a small break in the

barriers between quantum realties. Worf was thrown into a state of

quantum flux. He immediately shifted into other realities.

CRUSHER: And Geordi's visor somehow triggered that effect?

DATA: Exactly. The visor uses a subspace field pulse. I believe that

whenever Geordi came near Worf, the field pulse intensified the quantum

flux and pushed Worf into another reality.

WORF: How can we find my original quantum state and return me to it?

WESLEY: We could scan the quantum fissure using a subspace differential

pulse. Maybe we could locate the quantum state that shares Worf's

signature and find a way to get him back.

DATA: An excellent idea, Lieutenant.

[Worf's quarters]

(the impressionist painting is back in place)

TROI: Worf. From what I understand, there's a good chance my Worf won't

return. I guess it's just hard for me to accept that there's a reality

out there where you never loved me.

WORF: Deanna, I have always considered you a close friend. And although

I have never seriously considered a romantic relationship, I would not

be opposed to the possibility.

TROI: What about our children?

WORF: Children?

TROI: You didn't know?

WORF: When the last shift occurred in Sickbay, we did not have any

children.

TROI: We have a little girl, Shannara, she's two years old, and a three

year old boy, Eric Christopher.

WORF: What about Alexander?

TROI: Alexander?

WORF: He was my son in another reality.

[Bridge]

WESLEY: I've used a differential pulse to analyze

over ten million quantum states within the fissure, but I still haven't

found one with your signature. This may take some time, sir.

DATA: Captain, a Bajoran ship is approaching.

RIKER: Red Alert.

WORF: Sir, the Bajorans?

TROI: Ever since the Bajorans overpowered the Cardassian Empire,

they've become more and more aggressive.

RIKER: Yesterday they destroyed one of our subspace telescopes because

they thought we were using it to spy on them.

WESLEY: They're charging their weapons, sir.

WORF: Shields!

RIKER: Return fire.

WESLEY: They've damaged our power systems, sir. It's caused an energy

surge within the subspace pulse. The quantum fissure is beginning to

destabilise.

RIKER: Can we disengage the pulse?

WESLEY: Too late, sir.

(the fissure goes rainbow, then more Enterprises pop into this

existence)

RIKER: What the hell is happening?

DATA: The barriers between quantum realties are breaking down. Other

realties are emerging into our own.

('and thick and fast they came at last, and more, and more,

and more')

WESLEY: The Bajoran ship is disengaging, sir.

DATA: The rate of quantum incursions is increasing exponentially. At

this rate, the sector will be completely filled with Enterprises within

three days.

WESLEY: Captain, we're receiving two hundred eighty five thousand

hails.

RIKER: I wish I knew what to tell them. Mister Data, can we stop these

incursions?

DATA: Perhaps, if we can find the ship which that Commander Worf's

quantum signature.

RIKER: How would that help?

DATA: It was Worf's shuttlecraft which traversed the fissure and

weakened the barriers between quantum realities. If he re-enters the

fissure in his original shuttle, and emits a broad spectrum warp field,

it may be enough to seal the fissure and stop additional realities from

emerging into our own.

RIKER: What then? How do we get the Enterprises that are already here

back to where they belong?

DATA: In theory, the act of sealing the fissure should restore the

barriers between quantum states. The ships would return to their own

realities.

RIKER: Lieutenant Crusher, send a general hail, all ships.

WESLEY: Aye, sir.

RIKER: This is Captain Riker of the Enterprise. That is, the Enterprise

which is indigenous to this universe. We've all encountered a quantum

anomaly. We think we have found a way to return all of us to our proper

realities, but we need to find that ship which exhibits a certain

quantum signature. Our Mister Data will transmit that signature to you

now.

(a not too brief pause)

RIKER: Anything?

WESLEY: There's too much comm. traffic, sir. It's tough to isolate

who's talking to who. Wait a minute. Here it is. Someone's responding.

RIKER: On screen.

PICARD [on viewscreen]: Captain, it would that we have found the

quantum signature you are looking for.

RIKER: Data believes that by sending Worf back through the fissure

again, it would return us all to our proper realities.

PICARD [on viewscreen]: Our Data has said the same thing.

RIKER: We need you to send us your shuttlecraft Curie.

PICARD [on viewscreen]: We're launching it now.

RIKER: Thank you. It's good to see you again, Captain. It's been a long

time.

(viewscreen Picard looks at his Riker, and Worf)

[Shuttlebay]

RIKER: Did they send the right shuttle?

DATA: Yes, sir. It matches Commander Worf's quantum signature

precisely. I have remodulated the shuttle's engines to emit an inverse

warp field. You will need to activate the field at the precise moment

you enter the fissure.

WORF: Assuming it works, will I find myself near my own ship?

DATA: That is one possibility. However, the uncertainty principle

dictates that time is a variable in this equation. You may end up

several days before the event or several days after. There is no way to

tell.

WORF: I understand.

RIKER: Good luck.

(Data and Riker leave. Worf and Deanna embrace, then kiss)

[Shuttlecraft]

WORF: Setting course for the fissure.

RIKER [OC]: Acknowledged.

[Bridge]

WESLEY: Captain, the shuttlecraft is under attack.

RIKER: The Bajorans again.

WESLEY: No, sir. It's one of the Enterprises. They're hailing us.

RIKER: On screen.

(a bad signal and a Riker with a full ragged beard)

RIKER [on viewscreen]: We won't go back. You don't know what it's like

in our universe. The Federation's gone, the Borg is everywhere! We're

one of the last ships left. Please, you've got to help us!

RIKER: I'm sorry, there's no choice. If this works, everything will

return to

RIKER [on viewscreen]: No, we won't go back!

(transmission ends)

WESLEY: Sir, they're firing on the shuttlecraft.

RIKER: Open fire. Try to disable them.

WESLEY: Direct hit. Their shields have collapsed. Their engine core is

overloading.

(KaBOOM)

RIKER: What happened?

WESLEY: It looks like the ship had already taken heavy damage. Their

warp containment field must have been weak.

RIKER: Probably from fighting with the Borg.

DATA: Captain, Worf is entering the fissure.

[Shuttlecraft]

WORF: Charging primary systems. Initiating inverse

warp field.

(there's a flash, there are at least three Worfs in gold and four in

red, then Worf in gold is lying on the floor. He gets up)

WORF: Worf to Enterprise.

PICARD [OC]: Enterprise here.

WORF: Captain, is everything all right?

PICARD [OC]: Yes, Lieutenant. Is there a problem?

WORF: No, I do not believe so, but I will explain when I arrive.

PICARD [OC]: How was the Bat'leth tournament?

(he checks the trophy)

WORF: It was fine, sir. I won Champion Standing.

[Corridor]

RIKER: So you think this quantum fissure is nothing

that we need to worry about?

WORF: No. No, I believe the inverse warp field resealed it.

RIKER: I'm looking forward to reading your report.

(Worf hesitates outside his quarters)

RIKER: Something wrong?

WORF: I know what you are planning, sir. I will not be surprised.

RIKER: Surprised? I don't know what you're talking about.

WORF: Of course you don't.

[Worf's quarters]

(Worf puts down his bat'leth and trophy, then

gingerly checks the bedroom)

TROI: (entering from the other side) Welcome home, Worf. (he nearly has

a heart attack) I hope you don't mind, I let myself in. I promised

Alexander I'd feed his Dalvin hissing beetle while you were both away.

WORF: So you do not live here?

TROI: What's that supposed to mean?

WORF: It is a long story.

TROI: Happy birthday, Worf. Will wanted to give you a surprise party,

but I knew you'd hate it so I talked him out of it.

WORF: Thank you.

TROI: I know Klingons like to be alone on their birthdays. I'm sure you

have to meditate, or hit yourself with a pain stick or something.

WORF: Deanna. You do not have to leave.

TROI: Oh?

WORF: I have not had dinner. Would you care to join me?

TROI: I'd love to.

WORF: Champagne.

47457.1

Original Airdate: 10 Jan, 1994

 

 [Observation lounge]

(it's Captain Picard Day - children's arts and

crafts - and the judging is taking place)

PICARD: I don't know why we have to do this every year. I thought that

last year the teachers had agreed that they wouldn't do this anymore.

TROI: Captain Picard Day is one of the children's favourite school

activities. They look forward to it all year.

PICARD: Why does it have to be me?

TROI: Because you're the Captain, and they look up to you. You're a

role model for them.

PICARD: Well, they seem to have a somewhat exaggerated impression of

me.

RIKER: (imitating Picard and using a doll) I don't know. I think the

resemblance is rather striking. Wouldn't you agree, Number One?

PICARD: Isn't there something else you have to do?

RIKER: I'll be on the Bridge.

(starts to walk off with a Picard doll)

TROI: Will.

(Riker puts the doll back and leaves)

TROI: The finalists will be here in half an hour. You have to pick a

first, second and third place, and four honourable mentions.

WORF [OC]: Worf to Captain. Incoming transmission from Admiral

Blackwell. It is coded Priority One.

PICARD: Put it through, Mister Worf. Excuse me, Counsellor.

(Troi leaves)

PICARD: Yes, Admiral?

BLACKWELL [on monitor]: (a lady) Captain, what is your status?

PICARD: We are conducting energy output studies of the Mekoria Quasar.

All systems normal. The ship is fully operational.

BLACKWELL [on monitor]: Good. I'm postponing the quasar study for the

moment. The Enterprise is to rendezvous with the starship Crazy Horse

in sector one six zero seven immediately. You're authorised to exceed

warp speed limitations for the duration of this assignment.

PICARD: I understand. What is our assignment?

BLACKWELL [on monitor]: I'd prefer not to discuss it over subspace

channels. The Crazy Horse will be carrying someone from Starfleet

Intelligence. He'll brief you when he arrives.

PICARD: Very well.

BLACKWELL [on monitor]: Captain Picard Day?

PICARD: Oh, er, yes. It's, er, it's for the children. I'm, er, ha, ha,

I'm a role model.

BLACKWELL [on monitor]: I'm sure you are. Starfleet out.

[Corridor]

RIKER: So, who won the contest?

PICARD: Paul Menegay, a seven year old. He did a most interesting clay

sculpture of my head.

RIKER: Was that the orange one with the lumpy skin?

PICARD: Yes. Oh, you'll be interested to know that I've arranged for a

Commander Riker Day next month. I'm even considering making an entry

myself.

RIKER: Great.

[Transporter room]

PICARD: Energise.

CREWMAN: Aye, sir.

PRESSMAN: Will. I'll bet you never thought you'd see me again.

(everyone say hi! to Terry O'Quinn, eventually to be John Locke on

Lost)

RIKER: It's good to see you, sir.

PRESSMAN: Yeah, sure it is. You look like you're about to faint.

RIKER: No. It's just it's been a long time. Captain Jean-Luc Picard,

Admiral Erik Pressman.

PICARD: Pressman? Yes, of course. You were Will's first commanding

officer, on the Pegasus.

PRESSMAN: That's right. As a matter of fact, the Pegasus is the reason

I'm here.

RIKER: Sir?

PRESSMAN: The Pegasus is still out there, Will. And the Romulans found

her.

[Observation lounge]

PRESSMAN: As you know, the starship Pegasus was

lost in this sector some twelve years ago along with most of its crew.

I was the captain and Commander Riker here was my helmsman.

PICARD: I remember hearing about it. The ship was destroyed by a warp

core breach as I recall.

RIKER: The Captain and I, along with seven others managed to get to the

escape pod before the breach became critical.

PRESSMAN: From space, we saw what appeared to be a matter-antimatter

explosion which vaporised the ship.

RIKER: No wreckage was found, so Starfleet officially declared the ship

destroyed.

PRESSMAN: However, all that changed three days ago. Starfleet

Intelligence has an operative in Romulan High Command. He sent us a

message that a Romulan warbird had located a piece of debris in the

Devolin system which was positively identified as being from the

Pegasus. The warbird was then ordered to locate the rest of the ship,

if possible, and retrieve it.

LAFORGE: What would the Romulans want with pieces of a twelve year old

starship?

PRESSMAN: The Pegasus was a prototype. Experimental engine, new weapon

systems. In fact, some of our designs were used in constructing the

Enterprise. There are a lot of things on board the Romulans would love

to get their hands on.

PICARD: What are our orders?

PRESSMAN: To find the ship before the Romulans do. Salvage it if

possible, destroy it if necessary. You command the Enterprise while I

remain in command of the overall mission.

LAFORGE: We'll need metallurgical and chromographic specs on the

Pegasus in order to set up the proper search parameters.

PRESSMAN: I'll make the appropriate information available to you.

PICARD: Very well. Lay in a course for the Devolin system.

RIKER: Aye, sir.

[Bridge]

DATA: Captain, we are approaching the Devolin

system.

PICARD: Any sign of the Romulans?

DATA: No, sir.

PRESSMAN: Oh, they're out there. They're just waiting to see what

you're going to do.

PICARD: Mister La Forge?

LAFORGE: There's an awful lot of ionising radiation in this system,

Captain. That and the sheer amount of rock is going to slow down our

search a little.

PICARD: How slow?

LAFORGE: I'd say at least

WORF: Sir, Romulan warbird decloaking directly ahead.

WORF: They are powering weapons.

RIKER: Shields up. Red alert. Prepare phasers.

WORF: Sir, they are hailing us.

PICARD: On screen.

SIROL [on viewscreen]: I am Commander Sirol of the Romulan vessel

Terix. To whom do I have the honour of speaking?

PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation starship

Enterprise.

SIROL [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard. I've heard so much about you. A

pleasure to make your acquaintance. I hope our sudden appearance didn't

startle you.

PICARD: Not at all. But your unannounced appearance might have

unfortunate consequences. It would be an awful shame if your ship were

damaged due to some misunderstanding.

SIROL [on viewscreen]: I am touched by your concern for my ship, but I

doubt we were ever in any danger. May I ask what you are doing in this

system?

PICARD: I might ask you the same question.

SIROL [on viewscreen]: We are conducting a survey of gaseous anomalies.

PICARD: How interesting. So are we. Perhaps we could combine our

efforts and share our findings.

SIROL [on viewscreen]: I doubt our objectives are compatible.

PICARD: Perhaps you're right.

SIROL [on viewscreen]: This has been a most pleasant conversation, but

we must return to our research.

PICARD: Then I won't keep you.

(transmission ends)

WORF: Sir, they are moving off, resuming their tachyon scans of the

system.

PICARD: Stand down Red alert, but keep tracking their movement,

Lieutenant.

WORF: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Commander, how long will it take us to search this system?

LAFORGE: At least seven days, sir.

WORF: And the Romulans have a two day head start.

PICARD: Then let's get to it. Mister Data?

DATA: Initiating sensor sweep of grid zero one.

[Ten Forward]

PRESSMAN: How long have you had that beard?

RIKER: About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked.

PRESSMAN: What was it that Lieutenant Boylen used to call you?

RIKER: Ensign Babyface.

PRESSMAN: You never did have much of a sense of humour.

RIKER: I like to think that I've lightened up a little in my old age.

PRESSMAN: Really?

RIKER: I've been known to tell a joke or two.

PRESSMAN: Well, it's about time. You were always so serious on the

Pegasus.

RIKER: We went through some serious times. Do you really think we're

going to find the Pegasus again?

PRESSMAN: I wouldn't have come all the way out here if I didn't.

RIKER: What about the experiment? Do you think we're going to find that

too?

PRESSMAN: Maybe.

RIKER: I think a lot about what happened, especially on that last day.

PRESSMAN: So do I. It's not the kind of thing you just forget.

RIKER: Do you ever wonder if we did the right thing?

PRESSMAN: Never. What happened was a tragedy, yes, but it wasn't your

fault and it wasn't mine. What we were doing was for the good of the

Federation, and we can't blame ourselves if the others couldn't see

that.

RIKER: I know, but, maybe we went about it the wrong way.

PRESSMAN: Well, this time we may have a chance to do it the right way.

If this mission is successful, if we find the Pegasus and the

experiment, we can finish what we started twelve years ago.

RIKER: You want to try again?

PRESSMAN: It's not just me, Will. The Chief of Starfleet Security has

personally given me her assurance of complete support.

RIKER: Admiral Raner? How many other people know about this?

PRESSMAN: Not many, and it's up to us to make sure it stays that way.

Raner has given me written orders for you. You'll find them coded in

the Enterprise computer. You've been instructed not to reveal the true

nature of our mission to anyone else, not even Captain Picard. Will,

don't worry. It won't be like it was twelve years ago. And this time,

no one's going to stop us.

 (for those who care about these things,

the travesty that was the

Enterprise series finale takes place at some point from here

on in...)

[Picard's quarters]

(this area of space is strewn with rocky debris)

PICARD: As a matter of fact, I never met Will until he reported on

board at Farpoint Station.

PRESSMAN: You chose your first officer without ever meeting him?

PICARD: I was looking through the records of about fifty candidates and

Will's was much like all the others, filled with lots of dry statistics

and glowing letters of recommendation that tell you nothing. I was

about to put it aside and look at another file and then something

caught my eye. There was an incident on Altair Three when Will was

First Officer of the Hood. He refused to let Captain DeSoto beam down

during a crisis. He disobeyed a direct order and he risked a general

court martial because he thought he was right. When I read that, I knew

that I had found my Number One.

PRESSMAN: You wanted someone with a history of disobedience?

PICARD: I wanted someone who would stand up to me. Someone who was more

concerned with the safety of the ship and accomplishing the mission

than with how something looked on his record. To me, that's one of the

marks of a good officer.

PRESSMAN: Frankly, I've always felt it was more important for an

officer to trust his captain's judgment. In a crisis, there's no time

for explanations. Orders have to be obeyed without question or lives

may be lost.

PICARD: I am aware of that, Admiral.

PRESSMAN: Of course you are. I guess this mission has brought up some

old ghosts for me. You know what it's like to lose a ship. You're

always wondering if there was something else you should have done,

something you missed.

PICARD: Admiral, the record regarding the loss of the Pegasus is a bit

vague from the moment just before you abandoned ship. Is there anything

that you can add to the official account?

PRESSMAN: I'm afraid not. But I can tell you this. Twelve years ago, I

needed an officer that I could count on in a crisis. Someone who would

support and obey my decisions without question. Someone who was willing

to trust my judgment. And that someone was Will Riker. Without his

loyalty, none of us would have survived.

[Sickbay]

(Riker is in a martial arts robe)

CRUSHER: What's wrong?

RIKER: I think I busted a rib.

CRUSHER: (to patient) Excuse me. What were you doing?

RIKER: I was doing bat'leth moves with Mister Worf. I jabbed when I

should've blocked. He caught me right in the side. It's a good thing we

were using sticks instead of the real blades.

CRUSHER: It's broken all right. Give him ten cc's of terakine for the

pain.

RIKER: I can't believe how stupid I was.

CRUSHER: You both must have got a little carried away, that's all.

RIKER: No, it was my fault. I got distracted at a crucial moment.

CRUSHER: It can happen to anyone.

RIKER: I knew what I was supposed to do and I didn't do it. If those

had real bat'leths I might be dead right now.

CRUSHER: There, all better. Will, it's all right. You made a mistake.

No harm done. You'll be better next time.

RIKER: Yeah, maybe.

[Bridge]

DATA: Scan of grid one five seven is complete. I am

moving to grid one five eight.

WORF: The Romulan warship is still searching grid two seven zero.

RIKER: They're sure spending a lot of time over there. I wonder if they

LAFORGE: Commander, I think we might have just struck paydirt. There's

a subspace resonance signature coming from that asteroid. From the

frequency variances, it looks like the pattern from a Federation warp

core.

RIKER: Captain Picard to the Bridge. Take us to within ten kilometres

of asteroid gamma six zero one.

(Picard and Pressman enter)

RIKER: Geordi's found something.

LAFORGE: There's a subspace resonance signature coming from that

asteroid, sir. It could be the warp core of the Pegasus.

PRESSMAN: I think he's right. I recognise some of the variance

patterns.

PICARD: Put the asteroid on the main viewscreen.

DATA: I have confirmed Geordi's readings. The resonance signature is

originating from somewhere beneath the asteroid's surface.

PRESSMAN: Beneath the surface? How's that possible?

DATA: This asteroid contains several deep chasms large enough for a

starship to enter. It is possible the Pegasus drifted into the

asteroid's gravitational field and was pulled down into one of the

fissures.

WORF: Sir, the Romulan warbird has altered course once again. They are

heading toward our position.

RIKER: They probably want to see what we're so interested in over here.

PICARD: Mister Data, how long will it take to determine the exact

location of the Pegasus?

DATA: At least another six hours, sir.

PRESSMAN: That's too long. If the Romulans start searching the

asteroid, they could find the ship before we do.

RIKER: I recommend we destroy the asteroid. It would take most of our

photon torpedoes, but it would preclude any possibility of the Pegasus

falling into Romulan hands.

PRESSMAN: Our top priority is to salvage the ship, Commander. I'll

consider destroying it only as a last resort.

RIKER: Yes, sir.

PRESSMAN: Captain, could you give me a third alternative?

PICARD: Mister Data, would it possible to saturate the asteroid with

verteron particles that could mask the resonance signature and prevent

the Romulans from detecting it?

DATA: In order for the deception to succeed, it would have to appear to

be a natural phenomenon. Verteron particles are artificial in nature.

LAFORGE: Wait a minute. We could blanket the asteroid with high levels

of ionising radiation. There's so much of it in the system already, the

Romulans won't know the difference.

PICARD: Mister Data?

DATA: Theoretically, sir, it should work.

RIKER: If we do this, we have to do it fast the Romulans will be within

sensor range in less than a minute.

PICARD: Make it so, Mister Data.

DATA: Aye, sir. Initiating ionisation field pulse.

PICARD: When he's finished we'll have to move away and make it look

like we've scanned the asteroid but haven't find anything.

RIKER: Lay in a course for the next search grid. Stand by to engage.

PICARD: If it works, the Romulans won't find anything and we can return

later. If it doesn't

PRESSMAN: If it doesn't work, we'll have handed them the Pegasus.

DATA: Ionisation pulse complete.

PICARD: Helm, one quarter impulse. Engage.

DATA: The Romulans are initiating a tachyon scan of the asteroid. They

have switched to their lateral sensor array. Beginning another scan.

RIKER: They're certainly being thorough.

DATA: The warbird has completed its sensor sweep.

PRESSMAN: If they found the resonance signature, they should be sending

away teams any second.

DATA: They are moving out.

PICARD: Mister Data, we must convince the Romulans that we're still

looking for the Pegasus. I want you to continue scanning this system.

DATA: Yes, sir.

PICARD: I want to be back at this asteroid at oh eight hundred hours

tomorrow. Plan your search pattern accordingly.

RIKER: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Admiral, would you care to join me for some late dinner?

PRESSMAN: Please excuse me, Captain, but I think I'd better turn in

early.

PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. Oh, and will you bring the

scan analysis to my quarters when you're off watch?

RIKER: Aye, sir.

(Picard leaves)

RIKER: Initiate search of grid one six three.

DATA: Beginning sensor sweeps.

PRESSMAN: Commander, I want to see you in the Captain's Ready room.

RIKER: Mister Data, you have the Bridge.

DATA: Aye, sir.

[Ready room]

PRESSMAN: What the hell is the matter with you?

Destroy the Pegasus before we've even taken a look at it?

RIKER: I thought it was more important that the Romulans

PRESSMAN: Well, you were wrong! We have a chance here to change the

balance of power in this quadrant, but we can't very well do that if we

destroy the Pegasus, now can we?

RIKER: No, sir.

PRESSMAN: It hasn't been easy for you I'm sure, keeping your Captain

and friends in the dark like this.

RIKER: I haven't enjoyed it, if that's what you mean.

PRESSMAN: I hope you understand that it's necessary.

RIKER: I understand that you think it's necessary.

PRESSMAN: You have changed.

RIKER: Changed?

PRESSMAN: Something the Captain and I were talking about. To be honest

I'm glad to see this kind of change in you, Will. State your opinion

and stand by it. It's a far cry from the young man who used to sit at

my helm and worry about pressing the wrong button.

RIKER: A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral.

PRESSMAN: Yes, they can. But it's important that a man changes the

right things in his life, not his sense of duty, not his sense of

loyalty.

RIKER: I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir.

PRESSMAN: I would like to think that too. Because those things say more

about a man than the rank on his collar or the

uniform he wears. They define him. Twelve years ago, a lot of older and

more seasoned officers turned away from their duty, but you stood up

for what was right. I'm sorry, Will. I know the kind of man you are. I

know that I can count on you again.

[Picard's quarters]

PICARD: Come.

RIKER: The scan analysis you asked for.

PICARD: Thank you.

RIKER: Is there something else, sir?

PICARD: Yes, there is. (reading) Judge Advocate General's Report.

Stardate 36764. Subject, inquiry into mutiny aboard USS Pegasus. Based

on testimony from Captain Pressman and other surviving officers, the

Judge Advocate believes there is sufficient evidence to conclude that

certain members of the crew did mutiny against the captain just prior

to the destruction of the Pegasus. Mutiny on a Federation starship?

That's shocking. It's unthinkable. And yet you've never mentioned it.

RIKER: No, sir.

PICARD: You know, it wasn't easy to get this record. I had to pull in

quite a few favours at Starfleet just to get a look at it. It seems

that it was classified by Starfleet Intelligence. So, not only was the

Pegasus carrying sensitive equipment which

must be allowed to fall into Romulan hands, not only was there a

mysterious explosion which seemed to destroy the ship but didn't, but

it seems there was a mutiny on board. Now, I've read the official

report of the inquiry on that mutiny, but I want to know your version

of what happened.

RIKER: I was on the Bridge. The ship was at yellow alert. We were

running some tests on the engines. Something went wrong. There was an

explosion in Engineering. Heavy casualties. In the midst of this

crisis, the First Officer, the Chief of Engineering and most of Bridge

crew mutinied against Captain Pressman.

PICARD: Why?

RIKER: They thought he was jeopardising the ship.

PICARD: And you?

RIKER: I was seven months out of the Academy, my head still ringing

with words like duty and honour. When they turned on him, I thought

they were a bunch of self-serving, disloyal officers, so I grabbed a

phaser and defended my captain. Two or three others joined us, but it

was clear by then that the mutineers had most of the crew behind them.

We felt a need to get off the ship. There was a running firefight all

the way to the escape pod. About five minutes after we left the ship

there was an explosion.

PICARD: The Judge Advocate also believes that the surviving officers

are deliberately withholding vital information from this inquiry.

Further investigation is recommended. Will, there was no further

investigation. This report was classified and then it was quietly

buried. Why?

RIKER: Sir, may I suggest you take this up with Admiral

PICARD: I'm taking this up with you, Will! The Judge Advocate thought

you were participating in a conspiracy to cover up the truth. Now, what

the hell is going on here, Will? Why did that mutiny happen? Why is

Pressman so determined to find your ship twelve years later?

RIKER: I've said all I can. I am under direct orders from Admiral

Pressman not to discuss this, sir.

PICARD: Very well. He's an admiral, I'm a captain. I cannot force you

to disobey his orders. Therefore I will have to remain in the dark on

this mission. And I will just have to trust that you will not let

Pressman put this ship at unnecessary risk. And if I find that that

trust has been misplaced, then I will have to re-evaluate the command

structure of this ship. Dismissed.

[Ready room]

BLACKWELL [on monitor]: Captain, Starfleet places

the highest priority on the success of this mission. Your request for a

delay is denied.

PICARD: Margaret, something's very wrong here. Do you know what's going

on?

BLACKWELL [on monitor]: I know that the Chief of Starfleet Intelligence

herself is watching this one, Jean-Luc. So you'd be well advised to

follow Pressman's orders and leave it at that. Starfleet out.

WORF [OC]: Worf to Captain Picard. We are approaching asteroid gamma

six zero one, sir.

PICARD: On my way.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister Worf, where are the Romulans?

WORF: They are out of sensor range on the far side of the system.

PICARD: Take us to within fifteen kilometres of the asteroid and hold

that position.

WORF: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Mister Data, report.

DATA: For the past several hours, I have been scanning the area where

we detected the resonance signature of the Pegasus. From the strength

and polarity of the signature, it would appear that most of the warp

core is still intact.

PRESSMAN: If we're lucky, the entire engineering section could be down

there.

RIKER: But how do we get to it? I wouldn't want to try to transport

through that much solid rock.

PICARD: Agreed. What about a shuttle? We could send it down through one

of these fissures.

DATA: I would recommend against it, sir. There may be gravimetric or

magnetic fluctuations inside the asteroid which would overpower the

engines of a shuttlecraft.

PRESSMAN: Sounds like the best solution is to take the Enterprise in.

RIKER: Into the asteroid?

PRESSMAN: That's right. Put this fissure on the main viewer. This chasm

is large enough for us to manoeuvre in. Besides, if we ever hope to

salvage the Pegasus, we're going to need a starship to do it.

PICARD: Mister Data?

DATA: It is theoretically possible, sir, but I am unaware of any prior

situations where a starship was taken so deeply inside a planetary

body. There may be unforeseen difficulties.

PICARD: Admiral, I don't think we can risk

PRESSMAN: I've made my decision. Prepare to take the Enterprise in,

Captain. That's an order.

PICARD: Mister Data, will you please note in the ship's log that this

action is being taken over my explicit objections.

DATA: It is so noted, sir.

PICARD: Yellow Alert.

RIKER: Shields up. Inertial dampers at maximum.

PICARD: Ensign Gates, plot a course into the chasm, manoeuvring

thrusters only.

GATES: Course plotted, sir.

PICARD: Take us in.

(Enterprise gently navigates the tunnel)

DATA: We are now two kilometres beneath the surface.

(shake)

WORF: Captain, we are encountering shifts in the magnetic field

density.

PICARD: Admiral, if is passage narrows to less than five hundred

metres, I will abort the mission. You can charge me with

insubordination if you wish, but I'm not going to risk the Enterprise

for a salvage operation.

WORF: Captain, I am reading a large resonance signature directly ahead.

(NCC53847 is sticking out of the rock)

PRESSMAN: Pegasus.

RIKER: What the hell happened?

DATA: Sensors show that the ship is still intact. However, sixty five

percent of it is contained within the asteroid.

RIKER: It looks if half the ship materialised inside solid rock.

DATA: Yes, sir. I do not understand how this could have happened.

PRESSMAN: Let's keep the speculation to a minimum. We have to begin the

salvage operation. The equipment we need was in main Engineering. Can

you scan that section of the Pegasus?

DATA: The starboard bulkhead of main Engineering is contained within

the rock face, but most of its compartment is still intact.

WORF: There is a hull breach in that section.

PICARD: If we begin a power transfer, can we restore life support

systems to that compartment?

DATA: I believe so, sir. The breach can be temporarily sealed by

extending our shields.

PRESSMAN: See to it. Once you've restored life support, Commander Riker

and I will beam directly into Engineering.

PICARD: Admiral, I would like to send down a complete away team

PRESSMAN: There's some very sensitive equipment over there. I don't

want anyone else near it.

PICARD: Yes, sir.

[Pegasus Engineering]

(one of the bulkheads is rock and there are bodies

around)

PRESSMAN: This room was open to space for twelve years.

RIKER: Vacuum preserved everything.

(Pressman switches on the lights)

RIKER: I wonder how many of the crew are buried back there.

PRESSMAN: We're not here for a memorial service. (he opens a panel)

It's still intact. What's the matter, Will? Don't you understand? We've

found it.

RIKER: I know. I kept hoping it wouldn't be here. That it had been

destroyed or that it was buried in that rock back there.

PRESSMAN: What the hell is that supposed to mean?

RIKER: It means that I can't put this off any longer. Right up until

this moment I had the luxury of time, but now I've got to make a

choice. And, Admiral, I'm afraid my choice is this. I can't let you

start these experiments again. It was wrong twelve years ago, and it is

wrong today.

PRESSMAN: You had better reconsider that position, Commander. We have a

mission to accomplish and you're going to carry it out.

RIKER: That's all you care about, starting these damn experiments

again. Look around. This room is filled with dead bodies. These people

died because of this thing.

PRESSMAN: Keep your self-righteous comments to yourself. I knew most of

these people a lot longer than you did. Yes, it was tragic, but it was

their fault.

RIKER: You don't know that. Neither of us knows what happened after we

left.

PRESSMAN: Well, it's not hard to guess. They tried to shut down an

experiment they didn't understand. Something went wrong and it killed

them.

RIKER: No. We killed them.

PRESSMAN: Now that doesn't sound like the same man who grabbed a phaser

and defended his captain twelve years ago.

RIKER: I've had twelve years to think about it, and if I had it to do

over again I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you

instead of them.

PRESSMAN: So on reflection you'd rather be a traitor than a hero.

RIKER: I wasn't a hero and neither were you. What you did was wrong and

I was wrong to support you, but I was just too young and too stupid to

realise it. You were the captain. I was the ensign. I was just

following orders.

PRESSMAN: And if you hadn't you'd be dead right now along with all the

rest of them. Dead because you listened to a bunch of mutinous cowards

who were too blinded by fear to see what I was trying to do.

RIKER: They were brave enough to risk their lives to stop you from

violating a treaty the Federation signed in good faith.

PRESSMAN: That treaty has bound our hands and given the Romulans a

tactical advantage for the last sixty years. I was simply trying to

level the playing field.

RIKER: And now you want to try it again? How many people will die this

time? Fifty? A hundred? A thousand?

PRESSMAN: All right, you don't want to help me? Fine. But you are still

under my direct orders not to talk about what you know and I expect you

to follow those orders to the letter. I made you, mister, and I can

break you just as easily. Do you understand me, Commander?

(the ship shakes)

PICARD [OC]: Picard to away team. Prepare to return to the ship

immediately.

PRESSMAN: Stand by, Enterprise.

(he gets the device out)

PRESSMAN: Pressman to Enterprise. Two people and one piece of equipment

to beam up.

[Bridge]

PRESSMAN: Report.

PICARD: The Romulans have destroyed the entrance to the chasm with

their disruptors. They've sealed us in.

WORF: Sir, there is an incoming message. It is from the warbird.

PICARD: On screen.

WORF: Aye, sir.

SIROL [on viewscreen]: Captain, you seem to be in a very unfortunate

circumstance. How can we help?

PICARD: Are you responsible for this?

SIROL [on viewscreen]: I'm not sure. We were conducting some geological

experiments on the surface of the asteroid. It is entirely possible

that we accidently sealed you in. If only we had known you were beneath

the surface, if you had shared your plans with us, this might have been

avoided.

PICARD: What do you want, Sirol?

SIROL [on viewscreen]: I don't want anything, Captain, but I will offer

to help you.

PICARD: How?

SIROL [on viewscreen]: By transporting your crew aboard my ship. We'll

take you back to Romulus where, after a short stay as our guests, you

will be returned to the Federation.

PICARD: Thank you for your generous offer. I will take it under

advisement.

SIROL [on viewscreen]: As you wish. We will be continuing our research

in this system for a while longer. I await your decision.

(transmission ends)

PRESSMAN: We can't do it. If we abandon the Enterprise they'll come

back here and get their hands on both ships.

PICARD: Agreed. Options?

WORF: Captain, I believe we could use the phasers to cut our way out.

DATA: The asteroid's internal structure is highly unstable. Any attempt

to cut through the rock could cause the entire chasm to collapse.

RIKER: Captain, I have a suggestion. There's a piece of equipment in

Admiral Pressman's quarters under guard which might get us out of here.

It's a prototype for a Federation cloaking device.

PRESSMAN: You just ended your career, Will.

PICARD: That's what it's all about. A cloaking device. In the Treaty of

Algeron the Federation specifically agreed not to develop cloaking

technology.

PRESSMAN: And that treaty is the biggest mistake we ever made. It's

kept us from exploiting a vital area of defence.

PICARD: That treaty has kept us in peace for sixty years, and as a

Starfleet officer, you're supposed to uphold it.

PRESSMAN: Now that's enough. I'm taking command of this vessel. Mister

Worf, escort the Captain to his quarters.

(Worf folds his arms)

RIKER: I don't think anyone's going to come to your defence this time.

PICARD: How do we use the cloak to escape from the asteroid?

RIKER: It's more than just a cloak. It changes the structure of matter.

In theory, a ship using this device could pass through normal matter.

PICARD: I see why you were so eager to find it.

PRESSMAN: Can't you see the potential here? The phasing cloak could be

the greatest breakthrough in weapons research in the last fifty years.

PICARD: Except it's illegal. It's in violation of an agreement that the

Federation signed in good faith.

RIKER: Captain, I think we could adapt the cloak for the Enterprise.

PICARD: Mister Data?

DATA: Theoretically it is possible, sir. But it would take several

hours to study the device and determine how to link it to our systems.

PICARD: Make it so.

Captain's log, stardate 47457.1. We have been

trapped inside the asteroid for over eight hours. Mister Data and

Commander La Forge inform me that they are nearly ready to engage the

cloak.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Commander, we've routed the impulse

engines through the plasma conduits, but you'll have to watch the

intercooler levels. If they get too high, we'll blow the entire relay

system.

RIKER [OC]: Understood.

[Bridge]

RIKER: I think that's what happened twelve years

ago. The cloak blew out the plasma relays on the Pegasus after we left

the ship. The plasma ignited in space, and it looked as if the ship had

been destroyed.

PRESSMAN: So the ship drifted into this system still in a phased state,

and when it passed through this asteroid

RIKER: The cloak failed, and half the ship materialised in solid rock.

LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Bridge.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: The cloak is online and ready to begin

phase sequencing.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Proceed, Number One.

RIKER: Aye, sir. Activating power systems.

(and the Enterprise vanishes)

PICARD: Report.

RIKER: The cloak appears to be functioning normally. The ship's

matter-energy phasing rate should be sufficient to pass through the

asteroid.

PICARD: Take us out. Manoeuvring thrusters only.

WORF: Aye, sir. We will reach the rock face in five seconds.

(there's no thump, just more rock on the viewscreen)

WORF: We have passed through two kilometres of the asteroid. Now within

one kilometre of the surface.

RIKER: We're approaching the surface.

(and the asteroid belt appears)

WORF: We have cleared the asteroid, Captain. The warbird is off the

port bow.

RIKER: They're still waiting for us to make up our minds.

PICARD: Disengage the cloaking device, Commander.

PRESSMAN: You cannot do that! If the Romulans see us decloak, they'll

know

PICARD: They'll know the truth, Admiral. Which is what everyone will

know very shortly. Carry out my orders.

(and Enterprise appears beside the green meanie)

PICARD: Mister Worf, send a message to the warbird. Inform them that

their government will be contacted shortly about this incident.

WORF: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Admiral, I am hereby charging you with violation of the Treaty

of Algeron. As Captain of the Enterprise, I'm placing you under arrest.

Mister Worf?

WORF: Admiral, if you will come with me.

RIKER: Captain, I'll have to be placed under arrest as well. (Picard

nods) Admiral.

PRESSMAN: I have a lot of friends at Starfleet Command, Captain.

(Pressman, Riker and Worf leave)

PICARD: You're going to need them.

[Brig]

(Picard sends out the guard, lowers the forcefield

on Riker's cell and goes in)

PICARD: I've spoken to Fleet Admiral Shanthi. There will be a full

inquiry once we reach Starbase two four seven, and that will probably

lead to a general court martial of Admiral Pressman and several others

at Starfleet Intelligence. Your involvement in this affair is going to

be thoroughly investigated, Will. There'll be some hard questions for

you to answer.

RIKER: I understand.

PICARD: You made a mistake twelve years ago, but your service since

then has earned you a great deal of respect, but this incident may cost

you some of that respect.

RIKER: I can't help but feel I should have come forward a long time

ago.

PICARD: When the moment came to make a decision, you made the right

one. You chose to tell the truth and face the consequences. So long as

you can still do that, then you deserve to wear that uniform. And I

will still be proud to have you as my First Officer.

(Picard and Riker walk out of the brig together)

Stardate:

47423.9

Original Airdate: 17 Jan, 1994



Captain's log, stardate 47423.9. We have arrived at Boraal Two in

response to an emergency distress call from Lieutenant Worf's foster

brother, Nikolai Rozhenko. He has been stationed on the planet as a

cultural observer.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Analysis. Mister Data.

DATA: The planet's atmosphere is dissipating, sir. Intense plasmonic

reactions are destroying it. The stratosphere is already breaking down.

There are turbulent radiation storms across much of its surface. I

estimate that the planet will be uninhabitable in less than thirty

eight hours.

RIKER: The distress call came in only four days ago. Why would Doctor

Rozhenko have waited so long before sending it?

DATA: Atmospheric dissipation is a rare and essentially unpredictable

event. When it occurs, it proceeds rapidly. Doctor Rozhenko may not

have had sufficient warning.

(ship shakes)

PICARD: What was that?

DATA: The dissipation effect is generating plasmonic energy bursts.

RIKER: Is there any danger to the ship?

DATA: I do not believe so. However, we may experience intermittent

system failures and power surges as a result.

PICARD: Keep an eye on it. Mister Worf, any luck?

WORF: There is still no response to our hails, sir. I am attempting to

scan the observation post.

RIKER: He could be hurt. Maybe he can't respond.

WORF: Sensor interference is significant, but the post appears to be

intact. Their power grid is still functioning. However, I am reading no

life forms within the structure.

RIKER: It's not like him to the post.

PICARD: Especially under these circumstances.

WORF: Captain, I am detecting faint power emissions from a system of

caverns near the post. It could be a deflector shield.

RIKER: That can't be native to the planet. The Boraalans don't have

anything close to that level of technology.

WORF: Captain, request permission to lead an away team.

PICARD: Very well. But regardless of this planet's immediate situation,

we must observe the Prime Directive. I want to minimise the risk of

contact with the inhabitants. You will go alone, Mister Worf, and I

want to have you surgically altered so that you could pass as a

Boraalan.

WORF: Aye, sir.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: You're worried about Nikolai, aren't you?

WORF: Yes.

CRUSHER: Are the two of you close?

WORF: We are brothers.

CRUSHER: You never talk much about him. What's he like?

WORF: Nikolai is older than I. We are not alike. We had many

disagreements when we were growing up.

CRUSHER: That's not unusual.

WORF: Nikolai has a mind of his own. He attended Starfleet Academy, but

he was unable to follow the rules. He left after one year. But he has

many fine qualities. He is brilliant, persuasive. A natural leader.

CRUSHER: Sounds intriguing. I look forward to meeting him.

[Passageway]

(Worf beams into an underground cavern complex and

starts scanning)

VORIN: What are you doing here? You're not from our village. Who are

you?

KATERAS: (old man) Who is this?

WORF: My name is Worf. I am a traveller.

VORIN: How did you survive the storms?

NIKOLAI: (a thick-set man) I would know that voice anywhere. Worf, is

it really you? It's good to see you. You've changed a lot in four

years.

WORF: Nikolai?

NIKOLAI: Yes. Oh, Worf. This is my brother, Worf. He's come to help us.

[Cavern]

(main living area with campfire and water supply)

VORIN: But if you were able to get here, the storms must have subsided.

WORF: Please.

VORIN: Do you think it's safe enough to return to the surface?

WORF: Please, I must speak to my brother.

(they move away from the locals)

WORF: Nikolai, what have you done?

NIKOLAI: They were dying. I refused to sit there safe in that

observation post and watch it happen. I set up a deflector shield to

screen these caves from the radiation and then I brought them here.

WORF: What did you tell them?

NIKOLAI: They think I'm a Boraalan. I told them I was from another

village far from here.

WORF: At least you had that much sense.

NIKOLAI: When I sent the distress call I knew the Enterprise was in

this sector, but I wasn't sure you'd be the one to come. I'm so glad

that you're here, Worf.

WORF: Nikolai, there is nothing we can do for these people. You have

only postponed their deaths.

NIKOLAI: I want to discuss that with your Captain.

WORF: And I am certain he will want to speak with you.

NIKOLAI: Friends, my brother and I must go back to the surface. He has

provisions and will need help bringing them here. We'll return shortly.

DOBARA: (or Cassidy Yates for DS9 fans)  It's too dangerous.

The storms can occur without warning. If you're caught in one.

NIKOLAI: Don't worry. Worf is a seer. He understands the nature of the

storms. He'll know when it's safe to travel.

WORF: Yes, that is correct.

KATERAS: Our seer died when the storms first came. We've been without

his guidance for many weeks.

VORIN: Let me go with you. I know the terrain better than anyone and I

can help.

NIKOLAI: No, Vorin. Worf and I will be safe. We'll return shortly.

[Observation lounge]

(Worf and Nikolai are back to their normal

appearances)

PICARD: Doctor, you were fully aware that the atmospheric dissipation

could not be stopped. What did you hope to accomplish by assisting

these people?

NIKOLAI: I was trying to give them a future. What I propose is we

create an atmospheric shield on the planet. We can camouflage the

equipment just as was done with my observation post. No one will ever

know it's there.

RIKER: You can't be serious.

NIKOLAI: Indeed I am. I realise it will only provide atmosphere for a

limited area on the surface, but it will be enough to save one village.

PICARD: I have no intention of compounding what you have done by

committing another gross violation of the Prime Directive.

NIKOLAI: Captain, the Boraalans have a rich and beautiful culture, a

deep spiritual life. They deserve the chance to survive.

And isn't that what the Prime Directive was truly intended to do, to

allow cultures to survive and grow naturally?

TROI: Not entirely. The Prime Directive was designed to ensure

non-interference.

CRUSHER: But aren't we interfering either way? If we take no action,

it's a conscious decision to let the Boraalans die.

NIKOLAI: Exactly. We have the power to save some of them. All we have

to do is exercise it.

PICARD: We are sworn to uphold the principle of the Prime Directive,

and until that is changed there is no further course of action that we

can take. Is that understood?

NIKOLAI: Some of my log recorders are still in my observation post.

They contain most of my research. Since it appears that the only way

I'm going to preserve Boraalan culture is in a museum, I request

permission to return to the surface and retrieve them.

PICARD: I'm afraid that won't be possible. But you can have full use of

the ship's computer to set up a comm. link and upload your data from

here. If there's nothing further, you're dismissed.

(all leave except Nikolai and Worf)

WORF: I'm sorry, Nikolai. I wish there were another way. I am quite

familiar with your communications systems. If you like, I will help you

set up your comm. link.

NIKOLAI: I'll do it myself.

[Bridge]

DATA: Captain, atmospheric dissipation has

accelerated over the past several hours. I estimate the planet's

atmosphere will be completely gone within three minutes.

NIKOLAI: Captain, I've completed my data uplink. With your permission,

I would like to integrate my research logs with the ship's library

computer.

PICARD: Of course.

DATA: The mesosphere is gone. Plasmonic reactions are now beginning to

break down the troposphere.

PICARD: Put it on screen.

(viewscreen goes out)

PICARD: What's going on?

DATA: It appears the plasmonic reactions are continuing to interfere

with our sensors.

RIKER: I thought you had compensated for that.

DATA: I had, sir. I will attempt to engage additional filtering

elements. Visual re-established.

PICARD: This is one of those times when we must face the ramifications

of the Prime Directive and honour those lives which we cannot save.

NIKOLAI: I find no honour in this whatsoever, Captain. You will forgive

me if I don't stay.

(the atmosphere disappears)

PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One.

(Picard leaves)

RIKER: Helm, take us out of orbit. Set a course for Starbase eighty

seven, warp five.

GATES: Aye, sir.

(a science station blows up)

RIKER: What happened?

DATA: There appears to be an unusual power drain in the EPS

distribution net.

RIKER: What's the source?

DATA: Unknown, sir. It is difficult to localize.

WORF: The power drain has registered on my security grid as well, sir.

It appears to be coming from deck ten.

RIKER: All right, Mister Worf, get a security team on it.

[Corridor]

WORF: Concentrate your scans on the EPS transfer

links.

(his security team split up, Worf ends up outside a holodeck)

WORF: Computer, open holodeck five.

COMPUTER: Unable to comply. Holodeck five is in use.

WORF: Override. Authorisation, Worf theta six one nine.

COMPUTER: Unable to comply. Holodeck control systems have been

bypassed.

(then the doors open)

NIKOLAI: Worf Come in.

[Holodeck Cavern]

WORF: What are you doing here?

NIKOLAI: I have to show you something. Whatever you do, stay quiet.

(Nikolai taps on a PADD and a 'window opens in the holodeck rock face)

NIKOLAI: Look.

(it's the cavern on the planet)

NIKOLAI: I've done what you refused to do. I've saved them.

[Corridor]

NIKOLAI: I started thinking about this days ago

when it became clear the planet was doomed. I knew if I could get

access to your ship's computer, I could generate a replica of the

caves. The hard part was transporting the Boraalans into the holodeck

without anybody on the Enterprise noticing. But I was able to blank out

the sensors and make it look like interference from the plasmonic

bursts. And it worked, perfectly. The Boraalans were transported while

they were sleeping. They never knew anything had happened.

[Turbolift]

WORF: Bridge.

NIKOLAI: It's a simple plan, really. That's the beauty of it. Worf,

trust me. This is going to work.

WORF: Trust you? You never had any intention of obeying the Captain.

NIKOLAI: I wasn't going to let those people die just because your

Captain started quoting Federation dogma to me.

WORF: Your duty was to respect the Captain's orders and to uphold the

Prime Directive.

NIKOLAI: Duty. That's all that really matters to you, isn't it? Well, I

refuse to be bound by an abstraction. The lives of the people of Boraal

are far more important to me. You worry too much, Worf. You always did.

Everything will work out.

WORF: You have disgraced yourself and you have disgraced me. I want

nothing more to do with you.

[Ready room]

PICARD: You realise your career is finished.

NIKOLAI: I know that, Captain, and I would do it all again.

PICARD: What do you expect us to do now? You have left us with a colony

of Boraalans who think they're still on their planet.

NIKOLAI: I didn't beam them up without a plan. I've given this a lot of

thought. I think we can find a new planet, an M class world, that can

be their new home.

PICARD: A home which would look very different from Boraal. You can't

really believe that they'll be fooled.

NIKOLAI: That's where the holodeck comes in. I'll go back and tell the

Boraalans we're going on a journey, to a different place where they'll

be safe from the storms. The holodeck can gradually change the terrain

as we travel, so that at the end, the holodeck simulation will match

the conditions on the new planet. Then we'll simply beam them down.

PICARD: What if it doesn't work? What if they become aware that

something strange is going on?

NIKOLAI: Captain, I can't prepare for every contingency, but I assure

you I'm accustomed to thinking on my feet. I'll deal with the situation

as it evolves.

PICARD: I'm not enthusiastic about this plan, but I don't see that we

have another option. Very well, let's give it a try.

NIKOLAI: Thank you, Captain.

[Stellar cartography]

CRUSHER: There are countless M class planets in

Federation space which can support the Boraalans. We need to narrow the

parameters.

DATA: It will take approximately nine and one half hours to complete

the analysis.

PICARD: Even then there's no guarantee that we'll find a suitable

planet.

DATA: That is correct, sir.

LAFORGE: Captain, you'd better take a look at this.

PICARD: What is it?

LAFORGE: We've got a problem, sir. I don't think it's going to be

possible to keep this holodeck simulation stable.

PICARD: Why not?

LAFORGE: The plasmonic energy surges from the planet are affecting the

ship's systems. We're having problems with the EPS systems and the

power distribution matrix.

NIKOLAI: And as a result, the holodeck imaging processor has been

severely destabilised.

LAFORGE: It's not a question of whether the simulation will break down,

it's a question of when.

PICARD: There's no way round it?

LAFORGE: Not while it's running. In order to fix it, I'd have to shut

down all of the holodecks and re-initialise the entire system.

PICARD: That will take hours.

NIKOLAI: We'll just have to hope the simulation holds long enough.

PICARD: Very well. Let's try it. Mister La Forge, I want you to monitor

the situation very carefully, and keep an open comm. link with the

Holodeck so as to be apprised of any problems.

LAFORGE: Aye, sir.

NIKOLAI: Captain, I'll return to the holodeck as soon as my surgical

alterations are completed and I'll prepare the Boraalans for their

journey.

PICARD: Considering the situation you have put us in, I don't think

it's wise to leave you alone with those people. Mister Worf will

accompany you.

WORF: Sir, perhaps someone else would be a better choice. Counsellor

Troi is familiar with

PICARD: Mister Worf, the Boraalans already know you. There's no need to

introduce them to anyone new.

WORF: Aye, sir.

(Nikolai leaves)

PICARD: Keep a close eye on your brother. I don't want him making this

situation worse than it is.

[Holodeck Cavern]

NIKOLAI: My friends, we have returned. We have

food. This is difficult to say, but you have a right to hear it. By the

time Worf and I had reached the surface, the village was gone. The

storms have destroyed everything. There is nothing for us to return to.

DOBARA: We can't survive in here. Our supplies won't last forever.

NIKOLAI: That's why we must leave. There is a place far from here where

there are no storms. It will be a difficult journey, but in the end we

will have a new home.

WORF: I know a way through the caves. We will travel safely until we

return to the surface.

VORIN: Where is this new land?

WORF: As we said, it is far from here. It will not be like the home you

knew. Even the stars may be different.

VORIN: Why would they be different? And how do you know we'll be safe

there?

NIKOLAI: My brother is a seer. If he says we'll be safe, you must trust

that we will be safe.

(a scream)

KATERAS: What's wrong?

TARRANA: Look.

(holodeck grid lines are flickering on and off in the pool)

WORF: Do not worry. It is an omen.

DOBARA: What does it mean?

WORF: This is the sign of La Forge. It is a message to travellers. It

is said when these lines appear and disappear

[Engineering]

WORF [OC]: In a pool of water, the road ahead will

be filled with good fortune.

LAFORGE: Hang in there, Worf. Give me just a second. There. That should

do it.

[Holodeck Cavern]

(the pool stops flickering)

NIKOLAI: You see? Our journey is already blessed. The road ahead is

long. Let us have a meal together, then we'll make preparations to

leave.

(the people disperse)

NIKOLAI: Worf, very good work. Apparently we don't make such a bad team

after all.

WORF: We are not a team. I am here because Captain Picard ordered me

here.

NIKOLAI: Worf, don't we both share the same goal? Aren't we both trying

to make this plan work?

WORF: Only because you forced us into it.

NIKOLAI: I'm not ashamed of what I did. I'm not sorry I saved their

lives.

WORF: You have not changed. You still expect people to solve the

problems you create.

NIKOLAI: I'm not here to work out the issues of our childhood. I'm here

to save a people who I care about. And if that upsets you, then so be

it.

[Stellar cartography]

DATA: These are the two planets which best match

our search criteria. Draygo Four features an unusually large temperate

zone. However, it is within three light years of Cardassian space.

CRUSHER: There are constant border disputes in that sector.

DATA: The alternative is Vacca Six. It is located in the Cabral sector.

CRUSHER: That's pretty isolated.

DATA: It offers a less hospitable climate than the Boraalans are

accustomed to. However, it would still appear to be the better choice.

Do you disagree, Doctor?

CRUSHER: No, Data, you're right. It's just that the enormity of what

we're doing is overwhelming. We are deciding the future of a species.

DATA: It is a formidable responsibility.

CRUSHER: There are so many questions we don't have answers to. What if

the climate is so different that it affects them in a way that we can't

anticipate? How do we even know they'll be able to survive? And if they

do, how will their society evolve and what impact will it have on the

Vaccan system? We have no idea what this decision will mean to their

future.

DATA: Doctor, I do not believe we can offer any guarantees. We can

simply make the best choice we have at the moment.

CRUSHER: All right, Data. Vacca Six it is.

DATA: Data to Bridge.

PICARD [OC]: Picard here.

DATA: We have located a new home for the Boraalans, sir.

[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: It is Vacca Six in the Cabral sector.

RIKER: We can reach that in forty two hours at maximum warp, sir.

PICARD: Very well. Helm, set course for Vacca Six.

GATES: Aye, sir.

[Holodeck Cavern]

(the meal is ending and Vorin is writing on a

series of thin wooden sheets)

WORF: What is this?

VORIN: Our chronicle. The history of our village. Doesn't your village

keep a chronicle?

WORF: Not in this manner.

VORIN: Then how do you teach your children their history, who their

ancestors were, where they come from?

WORF: We tell each other stories, make up songs.

VORIN: Stories change with each person who tells them. This, this will

always be the same. Our chronicle has been maintained for seventeen

generations. I was only able to save the last six. This shows the

destruction of our village. This is you and Nikolai leading us to

safety.

WORF: We must leave. Gather your belongings.

VORIN: One of the scrolls is gone. I must have dropped it in the

passageway. I'll go find it.

WORF: We must stay together. We will have to leave it behind.

VORIN: Worf, the chronicle is the life of our village. Without that

past, our future means nothing. I must find it.

WORF: Go, and return quickly.

KATERAS: Seer. I am an old man. Would you help me with my gear?

WORF: Of course.

KATERAS: That is Tarrana, my daughter. I am fortunate she was old

enough to survive the storms.

WORF: She is a fine girl.

KATERAS: She is a beautiful girl. She has not been promised to anyone.

If I do not reach our new home, I would like her to become your wife.

WORF: You will reach your new home. I promise.

(meanwhile, Vorin has found his scroll, and the arch partly showing in

the rock. He touches it and the door appears. He steps forward, it

opens and out he goes)

[Corridor]

(Vorin walks along, mouth wide open. Most people

ignore him)

WOMAN: Can I help you?

(he backs away into)

[Ten Forward]

MAN: All right, all right, it's okay. Do you need

some help? It's okay.

RIKER: All right, everybody. Back off, back off.

TROI: I know things must look very strange to you, but everything's

going to be all right. No one's going to hurt you. We're friends of

Nikolai and Worf. Don't be afraid.

VORIN: Nikolai?

TROI: Yes. He's my friend. That means you are, too. I promise I won't

hurt you.

VORIN: Please, help me. Where am I?

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: I'm sorry, there is nothing I can do. His

neural physiology is unusual. I can't wipe his memory.

PICARD: I see. How is he?

CRUSHER: As well as can be expected. I've given him a mild sedative and

Troi's been speaking with him. And he seems much calmer.

PICARD: Does he understand the situation?

CRUSHER: I think so.

PICARD: Contact Mister Worf. Make sure he knows what's going on.

TROI: Here he is now. This is Captain Picard.

PICARD: Vorin, isn't it?

VORIN: Why did you bring us here?

PICARD: Your planet was dying. It could no longer support life. We took

you away from it.

VORIN: But we never left the caves.

PICARD: We have the ability to create the illusion of other places,

like the caves on your planet. You have actually spent the last two

days here on this starship, not on Boraal.

VORIN: Then our home is gone.

TROI: Yes.

PICARD: Vorin, listen to me. We can visit many other worlds. We can

take you to one where you can build a new life.

VORIN: A new life?

PICARD: A chance for your culture, your people, to survive and grow.

VORIN: How can we grow when everything that made us who we are is gone?

[Holodeck planet surface]

(the group are travelling in sunlight along a rock

face)

NIKOLAI: Dobara, you go on ahead.

WORF: I will carry your pack. Go and join the others.

KATERAS: Thank you, seer.

NIKOLAI: It'll be dark soon, in a few hours. Would you ask Mister La

Forge to create a suitable campsite for us a few kilometres from here?

What's wrong?

WORF: Vorin has left the holodeck.

NIKOLAI: How did he get out?

WORF: I do not know, but Doctor Crusher cannot erase his memory.

NIKOLAI: What will they do with him?

WORF: They have explained the situation to him. He must make his own

decisions.

NIKOLAI: Wait. Are you saying that if Vorin wants to come back in here,

they'll let him?

WORF: That is right. He is not a prisoner.

NIKOLAI: But if he comes back here and tells the others what he has

seen on the Enterprise, everything we have done will be for nothing.

WORF: Then you should have considered that before you beamed them on

board. But you never think about the consequences of your acts.

NIKOLAI: If you mean by that that I'm willing to do something while

others hesitate, that's true.

WORF: Wherever you go, you create chaos. How many times did our parents

lie awake at night, wondering what kind of trouble you were in?

NIKOLAI: Oh, if only I could have been like you. Worf, the perfect son.

WORF: I was not perfect, but I was not wild and disobedient.

NIKOLAI: Of course not. You were too busy doing your duty.

WORF: I would rather be accused of that than making our mother weep.

But I see it is clear you have no intention of changing. I see no

reason to discuss it further.

[Holodeck campsite]

WORF: Commander, the holodeck malfunctions

[Engineering]

WORF [OC]: Are increasing.

LAFORGE: I'm running every stabilisation routine I know.

WORF [OC]: How much longer till we reach the new planet?

LAFORGE: We'll be there in less than eight hours. You're just going to

have to hold things together a little while longer.

WORF [OC]: Someone is coming.

[Holodeck campsite]

DOBARA: May I speak with you?

WORF: Yes, of course.

DOBARA: I don't know what Nikolai said to you but, please, forgive him.

WORF: It is an old argument.

DOBARA: I've never seen him like this. He's usually so confident, so

sure of himself. But now he seems different. Do you know why?

WORF: No. No, I do not.

DOBARA: Ever since Vorin was lost, people have been afraid. Worried

that we won't reach our new home. We need Nikolai's strength now more

than ever. When the storms first came to our village, many of us were

ready to die. But Nikolai refused to let us. He gathered us together

and led us into caves. He saved us. He is a brave and compassionate

man, and I love him. Please, go to him. Make things right between you.

I want us to be a family.

WORF: Us?

DOBARA: Yes. I want you to consider yourself my brother. After all,

you're going to be the uncle of my child.

[Bridge]

DATA: We are in synchronous orbit above the beam

down site, sir.

PICARD: Good. Mister La Forge, how much longer before we can transport

the Boraalans?

LAFORGE [OC]: A few more hours, Captain, but we've got some problems

here.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I don't think the holodeck's going to last

that long. We've had materialisation errors and resolution failures all

over the place, and it's getting worse. The simulation could fall apart

any minute.

[Bridge]

PICARD: We'll have the transporter room standing

by. But we may have to transport the Boraalans whether you're ready or

not. Please keep Mister Worf apprised.

LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, sir.

PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. We still have one more problem

to worry about.

[Vorin's quarters]

VORIN: Yes.

PICARD: We have arrived at the planet that I told you about. Have you

made a decision?

VORIN: I believe I would like to go back to my people.

PICARD: I see. What do you intend to tell them?

VORIN: I don't know.

PICARD: If you tell them the truth, what will happen? Will they believe

you?

VORIN: I'm not sure. It is a fantastic story.

PICARD: Perhaps they will think that you have had an hallucination, or

that you're insane.

VORIN: I don't think I would like to live my life knowing what I know

and being regarded as a madman.

PICARD: On the other hand, they may believe your fantastic story. They

would learn about alien worlds, starships.

VORIN: That would be disastrous. It would destroy everything they

believed in. I can't tell them the truth, but I don't think I can live

with a secret.

PICARD: Then stay here. Make a future for yourself with us.

VORIN: I need some time. Please.

[Holodeck planet surface]

WORF: How could you have mated with a Boraalan?

What were you thinking?

NIKOLAI: I don't owe you an explanation. This is a matter between

Dobara and me.

WORF: As usual, you are thinking only of yourself.

NIKOLAI: And as usual, you are here to point out the error of my ways.

WORF: You have treated Dobara with dishonour.

NIKOLAI: I have not! I love her and we're going to raise our child

together.

WORF: That is not possible. I cannot allow you to stay here.

NIKOLAI: You will have to kill me first.

(as they square up, everything flickers)

DOBARA: What does it mean ?

NIKOLAI: The storms have returned.

KATERAS: We will be killed.

NIKOLAI: No, you won't. Worf has the power to end the storms once and

for all.

WORF: Yes. But everyone must take shelter in the tents.

KATERAS: The tents won't protect us.

NIKOLAI: Worf will protect you. You must trust him. Hurry, hurry. Get

to your tents now.

WORF: Commander, it might be helpful if you could produce

[Engineering]

WORF [OC]: A storm. Wind, lightning and thunder.

LAFORGE: I'll see what I can do.

[Holodeck planet surface]

NIKOLAI: Get in! Get in! The storm is getting

worse! Stay inside. Worf and I will take care of you.

(once everyone is out of sight)

WORF: Commander, energise.

[Planet surface]

(sudden peace. the people come out)

WORF: The storms will not return.

NIKOLAI: As I said he would, my brother Worf has saved us all.

Captain's log, stardate 47427.2. The Boraalans have

safely reached the site of what will eventually become their new

village. None of them suspects they ever left their planet. However,

our success has come at a high price.

[Vorin's quarters]

(Beverly covers Vorin's face)

CRUSHER: I think it was some form of ritual suicide.

PICARD: He said that he had nowhere to go.

CRUSHER: He would have died even if we hadn't interfered.

PICARD: But he wouldn't have died alone and afraid.

CRUSHER: Are you saying you're sorry we saved the Boraalans?

PICARD: No, of course not. Our plan for them worked out well. But I

wish that Vorin could have bridged the gap between our two cultures. I

would have liked the chance to have known him better.

[Planet surface]

NIKOLAI: Go inside.

DOBARA: Nikolai, don't.

NIKOLAI: Please.

(she does)

NIKOLAI: I told you, you would have to kill me to get me away from

here.

WORF: I do not want to fight you, Nikolai.

NIKOLAI: Things were never easy between us, were they?

WORF: No.

NIKOLAI: It's my fault. If I'd been more like you, we wouldn't have had

so many problems.

WORF: No. If you had been more like me, these people would not be here

now. You gave them a chance at a new life.

NIKOLAI: And I intend to share that life with them. The village will

need a new chronicle. Someone will have to begin it. My child will need

a father. My place is here. I'm finally taking responsibility.

WORF: You were never good at drawing. How will you keep a chronicle?

NIKOLAI: I learn quickly.

WORF: Then perhaps there is hope.

(the two men embrace, then Worf takes one of the old chronicles)

WORF: Could I take this with me?

NIKOLAI: It's yours.

WORF: I will have to explain all of this to mother and father.

NIKOLAI: They won't understand.

WORF: They may. I will tell them that you are happy.

Stardate:

47423.9

Original Airdate: 31 Jan, 1994

  [Graveyard]

(What looks like a traditional British church and churchyard, with people wearing plaid sashes over their tweeds, and a bell

tolling)

CRUSHER: Most people on this colony will remember my grandmother as a

healer, but her abilities went beyond that. She didn't just relieve

pain and fight illness. She knew that wellbeing is more than a healthy

body. Her remedies often included words of advice as well as medicinal

teas, and often they were just as bitter tasting. I will miss Felisa

Howard very much. Her healing, her advice, and most of all, the

inspiration she has provided me throughout the years. Rest in peace,

Nana.

MATURIN: (not human) And so now we commit her body to the ground, earth

to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope that

her memory will be kept alive within us all.

ALL: Amen.

(most people through soil onto the coffin, but one man throws a

camellia. A little later, after the titles)

TROI: That was a beautiful.

CRUSHER: Oh, thank you. Deanna, did you notice a strange man at the

service? He was in his mid-thirties with longish hair?

TROI: No.

CRUSHER: He threw a flower on Nana's grave. A camellia. It was her

favourite flower. She used to keep them all over the house.

TROI: Maybe he was a friend or one of her patients.

CRUSHER: It was a very personal gesture, and he gave me a remarkable

look. Well, I guess I should be going back to the house. There are some

things I need to do. It's only a few minutes from here. Would you mind

coming along?

TROI: I'd love to.

CRUSHER: Thanks.

MATURIN: How long do you plan on staying?

PICARD: A few more hours. Why?

MATURIN: Well, as you know, Caldos is one of the first terraforming

projects of the Federation. Our weather controls and fusion systems are

nearly a century old. I wouldn't mind having a starship Engineer take a

look at them. Perhaps give us a few upgrades. Maybe in exchange for a

tour of the colony and a home-cooked meal?

PICARD: Well, we are due at Starbase six two one tomorrow morning, but

we could delay for a few days. Yes, I'm sure we could find the time.

MATURIN: Excellent.

PICARD: I would enjoy that tour. Caldos Colony is a most impressive

accomplishment. I actually feel as if I'm in the Scottish Highlands.

MATURIN: That was the intent. The cornerstone of every building in town

was brought from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen. The founders wanted

everyone to feel they had a piece of the real thing here. They didn't

want to just imitate Scotland, they wanted to recreate it.

PICARD: Tell me, Governor, I'm curious. You're obviously not Scots

yourself. What was it that drew you here?

MATURIN: Something about the culture, the heritage. When I was a boy,

my family visited Glamis Castle in Scotland. As I looked out across the

highlands, I felt as if I had come home.

[Howard home]

(C19 romantic style with lots of wood and bunches

of dried lavender. Beverly pokes at a fire in the hearth)

TROI: Your grandmother had remarkable green eyes.

CRUSHER: Every woman in the Howard family has had green eyes, except

for my mother and me.

TROI: How well do you remember your mother?

CRUSHER: Very well. I loved her very much. I can remember her face

smiling down at me, and I can remember the sound of her voice and her

scent. But mostly I remember Nana, who raised me after my mother died.

(she picks up a pierced metal lamp with a flickering candle in it)

TROI: That's beautiful.

CRUSHER: It's a family heirloom. It's been in the Howard clan for

generations. It's supposed to symbolise the enduring Howard spirit.

Wherever they may go, the shining light to guide them through their

fortune. Nana always kept it lit. I remember sitting here listening to

ghost stories with only the candle burning.

TROI: You should take it with you.

CRUSHER: I think I will.

TROI: I'm going to head back to the ship.

CRUSHER: You don't have to leave.

TROI: I just thought you'd like some time alone. I'll see you later.

CRUSHER: Thanks.

(Troi leaves. Beverly wraps herself in a blanked and goes upstairs

reading Felicia's journal)

(a middle aged man comes in and blows out the candle)

CRUSHER [OC]: Who's there?

(Beverly runs down stairs and grabs the lamp)

CRUSHER: What the hell are you doing? Get out of my house.

QUINT: I wouldna be so high and mighty with me, Beverly Howard Crusher.

I've spent more time here in the past five years than ye have in the

past twenty.

CRUSHER: How do you know who I am?

QUINT: I'm Ned Quint. I took care of your grandmother's house and her

affairs.

CRUSHER: Nana never mentioned you.

QUINT: There's a lot of things she didna talk about. Let me get rid of

that candle.

CRUSHER: Why?

QUINT: That candle has brought nothing but misery and bad luck to your

grandmother.

CRUSHER: Look, Mister Quint, I don't know what your relationship was

with my grandmother, but this is my house now and these are my things.

QUINT: That candle has been a curse on your family for generations. If

ye have a lick of sense, you'll listen to me right now and do away with

it. Now give it to me.

CRUSHER: This is a family heirloom and I intend to keep it. Now would

you please get out of my house. Now!

QUINT: Howard women. Always the same stubborn fools. I wash my hands of

it now. You stay on in this house and you keep that damned candle. I'll

not be responsible for what happens.

CRUSHER: Get out.

[Engineering]

DATA: The colony's aqueduct system is functioning

normally, as are the communication relays.

MATURIN: We've been having a few tremors over the past couple of

months. Could you check the seismic stabilisers?

DATA: Certainly.

MATURIN: You can't imagine what it's like trying to enjoy afternoon tea

while the earth is shaking.

LAFORGE: Governor, did you know you had a power fluctuation in your

weather control system?

MATURIN: No. Our weather control's been working perfectly for the last

twenty two years.

LAFORGE: I can't isolate the exact source, but the fluctuation seems to

be originating from one of the substations that regulates atmospheric

humidity for the colony.

MATURIN: Is this going to be a problem?

LAFORGE: No, not yet, but power distribution patterns are already off

by five percent.

DATA: I suggest we analyse the planet's weather patterns to see if they

have been affected. I am reading unusually high humidity across the

entire southern desert region and there is increasing cloud activity

above the northern coastal area. Possibly the formation of a storm

system.

MATURIN: A storm? It's the middle of summer. We don't have rain at this

time of year.

LAFORGE: Data, let's see if we can correct this. I'll check out the

colony's climatic flow array.

DATA: I will run a diagnostic on the thermal regulators.

LAFORGE: Don't worry, Governor. We'll keep you dry.

MATURIN: I certainly hope so. There's a caber toss scheduled for

tomorrow afternoon. I'd hate to see it spoiled by an unexpected

downpour.

[Corridor]

CRUSHER: You wouldn't believe what I've been

reading about in my grandmother's journals. You know she had a lover?

Can you believe that? Nana was a hundred years old.

PICARD: It would seem the Howard women have exceptionally vigorous

libidos.

CRUSHER: I certainly hope so. After all, I hope I can find a handsome

young man in his thirties when I pass the century mark.

PICARD: Thirties?

CRUSHER: Yes. According to these journals, his name is Ronin and he's

thirty four years old. They met just after my great-grandmother's

death. And I think I saw him at the funeral. A handsome young man

tossed a camellia onto her grave. But the strange thing is, she never

mentioned him in her letters. Never once. And yet it appears they spent

almost all their time together. It's as if she led an entire life that

I knew nothing about.

PICARD: Well it looks like we're going to be on Caldos for a few days

more. This will be a good opportunity to get your grandmother's affairs

in order.

CRUSHER: Thank you.

(Beverly enters her quarters)

PICARD: Thirties?

[Crusher's quarters]

(Beverly is in bed reading the journal when she

dozes off. The unlit lamp flickers briefly, then her nightgown is moved

from her shoulder)

RONIN [OC]: Beverly.

(she starts up, awake)

[Ten Forward]

TROI: You dreamt you were in bed with someone?

CRUSHER: Not exactly. I was in bed but there wasn't another person in

my dream. It was more like a presence.

TROI: You said you felt a touch.

CRUSHER: A pair of hands. They were moving across my skin.

TROI: Like a caress?

CRUSHER: Yes. And there was a voice, a man. He whispered my name. It

was as if I knew him, or more like he knew me. He knew exactly how I

liked to be touched. It was the most physical dream I've ever had. The

sensations were very real and extremely arousing.

TROI: Frankly, I'm envious.

CRUSHER: I did fall asleep reading a particularly erotic chapter in my

grandmother's journal. She wrote very detailed descriptions of her

experiences with Ronin.

TROI: Well, that's bound to cause a dream or two. So, shall we start

going over the personnel reports?

CRUSHER: You know, I think he had a ring on one of his hands when he

touched my shoulder, my neck. I wonder if I'll have another dream

tonight.

TROI: I'd read two chapters.

[Graveyard]

(Beverly is in local garb, and Ned is tidying the

edges of the grave)

QUINT: You probably want to be alone. I'll leave.

CRUSHER: No, Ned, it's okay. Look, I'm sorry we got off to a bad start

yesterday. I've been reading my grandmother's journals and I know how

much you meant to her.

QUINT: Aye, she was a grand lady. You'll not see many more like her.

You have your grandmother's fire, that's for sure.

CRUSHER: Ned, you're welcome to stay at the house after I've gone. I

need someone to take care of the place.

QUINT: That's verra kind of you, lass, but I'll ne'er set foot in that

house again. And I recommend that you dinna, either.

CRUSHER: Why?

QUINT: Like I tried to tell your grandmother, the hoose is haunted.

CRUSHER: Haunted?

QUINT: You believe what you want, lass. Just dinna light that candle.

CRUSHER: Why not?

QUINT: It'll bring the ghost. It's his home. Oh, he's out now,

wanderin' across the land, angry, angry at being driven out. That's why

he's bringing the storms.

CRUSHER: Ned, the weather systems control is malfunctioning. The

Enterprise is trying to repair it.

QUINT: Oh, sure. But who do you think is causing the malfunction?

CRUSHER: I think your imagination is

QUINT: Think what you want. See what you want. Just do as I say. Dinna

light that candle or dinna go to that hoose, or before you know it,

they'll be burying another Howard in this cemetery.

(Ned leaves. Lightning flashes and the grave is now covered in

camellias. Beverly flees)

[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, I am detecting atmospheric

turbulence over the colony and large pockets of electrical activity.

PICARD: On screen.

WORF: It is growing in intensity, sir.

RIKER: That's one hell of a thunderstorm.

PICARD: Bridge to Engineering. Mister Data, we're reading

[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: An extremely large storm system over

the Caldos colony.

[Bridge]

PICARD: I thought that the weather control

malfunction was not severe.

[Engineering]

DATA: It began as a minor power fluctuation, sir,

but the effect has spread throughout the control grid. It has caused an

unusual concentration of cumulonimbus activity above the colony.

LAFORGE: Captain, I suggest we set up a power transfer between the

Enterprise and the weather substations. Try to give them enough power

to stabilise the storm.

PICARD [OC]: Make it so.

[Howard home]

(Beverly enters, soaked from the storm. The house

is filled with camellias)

CRUSHER: Who's there? Ned? Is that you? Hello? I know somebody's here,

so I suggest you

(a mirror bounced against the wall. She removes it and is about to put

it back when she sees the reflection of a man behind her. She drops the

mirror, but there is no one there)

CRUSHER: All right now, that's it. If you don't show yourself right now

I am calling the Enterprise and there will be ten security guards here

within thirty seconds.

RONIN [OC]: Beverly. Beverly, I've come back for you

CRUSHER: Who are you?

RONIN [OC]: Don't you remember? I came to you last night while you were

asleep.

CRUSHER: No, that was a dream. I'm calling the Enterprise.

(she goes weak at the knees)

RONIN [OC]: Now do you remember me?

CRUSHER: Yes. What's, what's happening to me? Right now I feel so

strange.

RONIN [OC]: I love you, Beverly, just as I loved Felisa before you.

CRUSHER: Are you Ronin?

RONIN [OC]: Yes. You saw me at the funeral.

(Beverly has a little orgasm)

CRUSHER: Who are you?

RONIN [OC]: I'm a spirit.

CRUSHER: I don't believe in

RONIN [OC]: Ghosts? Nor did I in the beginning. I was born in sixteen

forty seven, in Glasgow on Earth.

CRUSHER: You're telling me that you're an eight hundred year old ghost?

RONIN [OC]: I found a home with Jessel Howard. She was a pretty lass

with a mane of red hair, and eyes like diamonds. I loved her very much.

When she died, I stayed with her daughter, and her daughter, and on

down through the years, generation after generation.

CRUSHER: And now you're here on Caldos, two hundred light years away?

RONIN [OC]: When your family moved out into the galaxy, I moved with

them.

CRUSHER: I don't believe you.

RONIN [OC]: I believe you are the most beautiful women I have ever

known.

CRUSHER: What's, what's happening to me?

RONIN [OC]: We're becoming one, Beverly. We're going to be together.

CRUSHER: I don't understand. Stop it!

[Crusher's quarters]

(Beverly is arranging flowers)

CRUSHER: Come in.

TROI: Hi, Bev. I just wanted to see if you were going to mok'bara class

this morning.

CRUSHER: No, I think I'll skip it today. I'm exhausted.

TROI: Did you have another dream last night?

CRUSHER: Not exactly.

TROI: Is anything wrong?

CRUSHER: Not at all.

TROI: Beverly, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you were seeing

someone.

CRUSHER: Deanna.

TROI: Now I know you're seeing someone.

CRUSHER: I'm not seeing anybody. I met someone, that's all.

TROI: Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for him. Beverly, when

are you going to realise that you can't fool me? Who is it?

CRUSHER: All right. I met Ronin.

TROI: Ronin? Your grandmother's lover?

CRUSHER: He's unlike anyone I've ever met before. I know this sounds

crazy, but I have never known anyone who was so

TROI: Passionate.

CRUSHER: Exactly. I can see why Nana fell in love with him. This sounds

very strange, doesn't it?

TROI: I admit it's unusual. I'm very happy for you. But I want you to

consider something. You and Ronin have both suffered a tremendous loss.

Very often, shared traumatic experience can create the illusion of

closeness and romance.

CRUSHER: Thank you for your concern, but I think I know what I'm doing.

Besides, I didn't say I was in love with him. I'm just intrigued.

[Turbolift]

MATURIN: You know, Captain, I moved to this colony

because it was a recreation of Scotland, but I must admit it's getting

to be a little too realistic.

(he sneezes)

[Bridge]

(there is low-lying mist on the deck)

PICARD: What the hell is going on?

DATA: There appears to be a condensed suspension of water vapour,

approximately one degree Celsius.

PICARD: Fog.

RIKER: It just sort of rolled in on us, sir.

WORF: There has been a malfunction in the ship's environmental control.

RIKER: We've traced the problem to the power transfer beam. There's

some sort of feedback coming from one of the colony's weather

substations.

MATURIN: Another power fluctuation?

WORF: Captain, the temperature in Ten Forward has dropped to below

freezing and deck thirteen has lost gravity.

PICARD: Mister Data, disengage the power transfer.

DATA: I am unable to terminate the connection, sir. A feedback loop has

formed in the transfer beam. I will have to go to the substation and

attempt to correct the problem from there.

PICARD: Make it so.

(Data leaves)

PICARD: In the meantime, I think I'll go get my jacket.

[Weather control station]

DATA: I have analysed the control module in the

primary weather control grid. It appears the station is experiencing a

system wide power failure.

LAFORGE: This is impossible. The back up systems should have

(an alarm sounds and they spot Ned underneath a console)

DATA: Excuse me, sir. You are dismantling the primary power conduit. I

must ask you to stop.

QUINT: No! (Data pulls him out) Get away from me! You dinna understand.

He's trying

to kill us all.

(green energy leaps out at Ned and throws him across the room)

DATA: He is dead.

(later, others have gathered)

LAFORGE: From what I can tell, he was trying to shut down the entire

weather control system. He was pulling out the primary plasma conduit.

That's probably what caused the plasma discharge that killed him.

MATURIN: I knew Ned Quint. He was an honest man. He mostly kept to

himself. I don't know why he'd try something like that.

LAFORGE: It's going to take us some time to get the system back online.

I'd say we need another day at least.

DATA: In the meantime, Governor, you should expect the weather problems

to continue.

CRUSHER: I think you'd better take a look at this.

(Beverly is by Ned's body)

CRUSHER: Data, you said there was a plasma discharge from the console

when Quint was killed.

DATA: That is correct.

CRUSHER: Well, that wasn't what killed him. I'm detecting an anomalous

energy residual throughout his body, right down to the cellular level.

Whatever it is, it wasn't the result of a plasma discharge.

(Data scans the corpse)

LAFORGE: Anything?

DATA: I cannot identify the energy residual. However, it appears to

have the same anaphasic signature as the power fluctuations we observed

from the weather control system.

LAFORGE: Then it's possible that whatever caused the weather

malfunctions also killed Quint.

DATA: It is possible.

LAFORGE: We should scan the colony for any energy readings that match

this anaphasic signature.

CRUSHER: Governor, with your permission, I'd like to take the body back

to the ship to run further tests.

MATURIN: Of course, Doctor.

CRUSHER: Ensign, ask Doctor Selar run a biospectral analysis.

NURSE: Yes, Doctor.

MATURIN: You're not going to run the tests yourself?

CRUSHER: No. I have some things I need to attend to.

[Howard home]

CRUSHER: Ronin, I've got to talk to you. Are you

here?

RONIN [OC]: I'm here. Beverly, did you miss me?

CRUSHER: Yes. But I must talk to you. There's been an accident.

RONIN [OC]: I know. Quint is dead.

CRUSHER: Why did it happen? What was he doing?

RONIN [OC]: Beverly, there's something more important we should talk

about.

CRUSHER: Ronin, I've got to know. Quint's dead.

(a hand reaches round and cups her face. His touch sends her all

unnecessary, and he maintains the contact all the time)

CRUSHER: Ronin?

RONIN: Yes. I need you to help me.

CRUSHER: Help you?

RONIN: It's not easy for me to take corporeal form. I can't do it for

long. I want you to light the candle.

CRUSHER: Quint said you lived in the candle. Is that true?

RONIN: Yes. If I'm away from it for too long, I begin to weaken. That's

why the women in your family have always kept the candle lit.

CRUSHER: The candle's on the ship. I'll go get it.

RONIN: No. I must go with you.

CRUSHER: How?

RONIN: The power transfer beam. I can travel along it.

CRUSHER: And when the candle's lit, then what happens?

RONIN: Then we'll be together, always.

(he kisses her into near ecstasy, then vanishes)

[Crusher's quarters]

CRUSHER: Computer, secure door.

(Beverly is agitated as if she's withdrawing from a drug)

CRUSHER: I lit the candle. Where are you?

RONIN: It's all right. We're together. we're going to be one. I'm going

to become part of you, Beverly. Would you like that?

CRUSHER: Oh, yes. More than anything.

RONIN: As it was with your grandmother, and your great-grandmother, and

all of the Howard women before them. I'll take care of you. And you

will feel love as you've never felt it before.

(Ronin turns into a green mist and enters Beverly)

[Transporter room]

(Beverly is in Caldos clothes, and the candle is on

the pile of bags)

PICARD: Beverly, what the hell is this?

CRUSHER: I thought it was pretty self-explanatory. I'm leaving

Starfleet. Energize.

PICARD: Belay that order.

CREWMAN: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Beverly, you can't just resign.

CRUSHER: I can, and I have. I've decided to stay on Caldos and become a

healer like my grandmother. It's a proud Howard tradition and I've

decided to uphold it. Energise. I've resigned my commission, so unless

you plan on kidnapping me?

(Picard nods and she is beamed away)

[Ready room]

TROI: Beverly was attracted to Ronin in a very

intense and intimate way. I warned her that it was all very sudden but

she didn't want to talk about it, so I let her alone. I sensed that she

was holding something back, that she wasn't telling me the whole truth.

PICARD: Do you think this Ronin could be exerting some sort of

influence over her? That it's because of him that she's staying?

TROI: It's possible. But she may really believe she's in love with him.

PICARD: This is a rash decision, ill considered. It's not like Beverly

at all.

TROI: I agree, but she does have the right to make that choice, even if

we don't feel it's a good one.

(doorbell)

PICARD: Come.

DATA: Captain, Geordi and I have detected an energy residual with the

same anaphasic signature as the one we found on Ned Quint's body.

PICARD: Where?

DATA: Approximately seventeen kilometres from the centre of the colony,

sir. It is coming from the cemetery.

PICARD: Data, I want you to go down to the cemetery. See if you can

pinpoint the source.

DATA: Aye, sir.

(Data leaves)

PICARD: In the meantime, I would like to meet with this Ronin.

[Graveyard]

(it is night)

LAFORGE: The energy readings are coming from this direction, but I

can't get an exact location. I'll try narrowing the scan field.

DATA: The energy readings appear to be originating approximately two

metres below the surface. I believe they are concentrated within this

burial site.

(the headstone says Felisa Howard)

[Howard home]

CRUSHER: I'm so glad you're here. I can't imagine

what life was like before I met you.

RONIN: And it will only get better.

(he turns into a green mist and enters her body)

CRUSHER: Oh, Ronin. I had no idea I could feel this way.

RONIN [OC]: We're nearly merged now. As two candles join to form a

single light, so we will flourish as one.

(a knock at the door)

RONIN [OC]: I love you, Beverly.

CRUSHER: I love you.

(another knock, then Picard enters)

PICARD: Beverly?

CRUSHER: Jean-Luc.

PICARD: Sorry I startled you. I knocked but there was no answer. The

door was open. I hope you don't mind.

CRUSHER: What do you want?

PICARD: Well, I'd hoped to meet your new friend, Ronin.

CRUSHER: He's not here.

PICARD: Well, perhaps I could wait, if you don't mind. I'm really

anxious to meet this remarkable young man who swept away not just one,

but two of the Howard women.

CRUSHER: (carrying the candle) Jealousy doesn't suit you, Jean-Luc.

PICARD: Have you changed the colour of your eyes?

CRUSHER: I just grew tired of the other colour. Don't you think it

suits me?

PICARD: I think that I preferred your eyes the way they were before. I

think I preferred you the way you were before, Beverly.

CRUSHER: Well, this is the way I am now. And this is my life. I've made

my decision and I'm not going to change my mind, so please leave me

alone.

PICARD: Oh, no, there's something's wrong here. Now, Beverly, this is

more than just an obsessive love affair that has got out of hand. Tell

me, why is it that no one has seen this Ronin except you?

RONIN: (coming down the stairs) All right, Captain. Here I am. I

believe Beverly asked you to leave her alone.

(Beverly goes to Ronin's side)

PICARD: So, you're Ronin. It's a pleasure to meet you. Where are you

from?

RONIN: Earth. Scotland.

PICARD: How long have you been on Caldos?

RONIN: All that matters is that I'm here now, and that Beverly and I

plan to be together for the rest our lives.

DATA [OC]: Data to Picard.

PICARD: Go ahead, Data.

DATA [OC]: Captain, we have located the source of the energy residual.

It appears to be concentrated within Felisa Howard's coffin.

LAFORGE [OC]: Captain, we'd like permission to exhume the body.

RONIN: You can't do that. Leave her alone.

PICARD: Why not? What are you afraid of?

RONIN: I'm not afraid of anything. But I cannot allow you to desecrate

her grave.

PICARD: Data, ask Governor Maturin's permission to exhume the body.

Picard out.

RONIN: I won't stand for this. I'll go to the Governor myself.

PICARD: Go on. I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't know who you are.

He'll probably have the same questions that I do. How did you get here?

What ship did you come on?

CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, leave him alone.

PICARD: Why don't you answer my questions? What ship? I'd like to look

at the passenger list. Where have you been living here? What's your

position? Who are your neighbours?

(Ronin vanishes)

PICARD: Come on, Beverly, we've got to get out of here.

(Picard touches Beverly and gets zapped by green)

CRUSHER: Jean-Luc.

(Beverly grabs her medical kit)

RONIN [OC]: Beverly, we must stop the others. They cannot exhume the

body.

CRUSHER: We can't just leave him. He might die.

RONIN [OC]: You must come. I am your love. I am the one who will take

care of you.

CRUSHER: I can't just let him die.

RONIN: Beverly, come with me.

CRUSHER: No. No!

RONIN: I'm sorry, I'm going to stop them.

(Ronin leaves)

CRUSHER: Come on, come on.

PICARD: I'm all right. Beverly, go after him. Go to the cemetery.

[Graveyard]

LAFORGE: La Forge to Enterprise. We're ready down

here.

CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir.

(the coffin is beamed out of the grave without the pile of soil

collapsing, and they

lift the lid off to reveal a white haired old lady)

DATA: I am reading definite signs of anaphasic energy in her body. It

appears to extend to the cellular level.

LAFORGE: That's impossible. She wasn't anywhere near the weather

station when Quint was killed. She died of natural causes.

DATA: I suggest we run a deep tissue scan to look for any signs of

(Felicia opens her bright green eyes, sits up and zaps the pair of

them)

CRUSHER: No! Ronin, stop this. Stop this, please.

FELISA: Beverly, it's all right. Have trust in me.

CRUSHER: You're not Nana. Nana's dead. Leave her alone!

(green comes out of Felisa and the corpse falls back. Ronin appears.)

RONIN: Beverly! Forgive me. These men were trying to stop us from being

together. Once they're gone, everything will be right.

CRUSHER: No, it won't. You've been infusing me with the same sort of

anaphasic energy that killed Quint.

RONIN: He was trying to destroy me. I had to defend myself. My love. I

could never harm you. I am here to protect you.

CRUSHER: No, you're not. There's no such thing as a ghost. You are some

sort of anaphasic lifeform. Anaphasic energy is extremely unstable. It

needs an organic host in order to maintain molecular cohesion or else

you'll die. Isn't that right?

RONIN: Beverly.

CRUSHER: I also scanned the candle. The flame is plasma based. You were

using it as a receptacle for yourself in order to get to me, in order

to merge with me. You have been using me, Nana, my entire family for

centuries.

RONIN: And I loved all of them! And they loved me. Give me the candle,

Beverly.

CRUSHER: No. No.

(Ronin gives Geordi another zap)

RONIN: Put it down, or I will kill him. Set it down and walk away.

(Beverly puts it down then grabs Geordi's phaser and destroys it)

RONIN: No!

CRUSHER: (into Geordi's comm. badge) Crusher to Riker. Will, close off

all the plasma conduits in the weather control system. I'll explain

later.

RIKER [OC]: Understood.

CRUSHER: You've nowhere left to go.

RONIN: Yes, I do.

CRUSHER: Keep away from me.

(Crusher shoots him)

RONIN: Beverly. I love you. Beverly.

(he runs at her and she destroys him)

Captain's log, supplemental. Commander La Forge and

Mister Data have recovered from their exposure to the anaphasic energy,

but I'm afraid Doctor Crusher's recovery will be of a more personal

nature.

[Ten Forward]

CRUSHER: Somehow, he realised that one of my

ancestors had a biochemistry that was compatible with his energy

matrix. I imagine that he took human form and seduced her like he did

me. I was about to be initiated into a very unusual relationship. You

might call it a family tradition. But there's a part of me that's a

little sad.

TROI: How so?

CRUSHER: I re-read the entries in my grandmother's journals. Whatever

else he might have done, he made her very happy.

Forward]

(a waiter is listening in on the conversation)

RIKER: Fletcher has more experience with propulsion systems.

TROI: But Carstairs is better with people. Considering this is a

supervisory position, I'd go with her.

RIKER: I guess you're right. Didn't we just do crew evaluation reports?

TROI: Three months ago.

RIKER: It seems like three weeks. Why don't we just give everybody a

promotion and call it a night, Commander?

TROI: Fine with me, Captain.

RIKER: Could we have two coffees, please.

(at another table, four young people hear Troi's laughter)

LAVELLE: (red uniform) What could be so funny? What's so funny about

crew evaluations?

OGAWA: Don't worry about it, Sam.

SITO: (gold, Bajoran) Can't we just try and have a good time here?

LAVELLE: How can I have a good time when my career's being decided

across the room? Come on. Think promotion. Promotion. Promotion.

TAURIK: (a vulcan) You can't really believe that what you are doing

will influence the outcome of your evaluation.

(actually, he will become Vaurik of Voyager)

LAVELLE: Promotion. Promotion. Promotion.

OGAWA: It's a time-honoured strategy, Taurik.

SITO: The Vedeks of the Janalan order maintain a round the clock chant

for the benefit of the Bajoran people.

TAURIK: Considering the history of your planet, that doesn't exactly

validate what he's doing.

LAVELLE: Promote me, please, so I can make Lieutenant and have my own

room.

TAURIK: If you're unhappy sharing quarters with me, then you should put

in for a new room assignment. Just in case you're not promoted.

(the waiter brings coffee)

RIKER: I've been thinking about who to promote to Ops.

TROI: The new night duty officer?

RIKER: Lavelle is an obvious candidate, but I'm also considering Ensign

Sito.

TROI: Thank you.

BEN: You're welcome. Are you sure about dessert?

TROI: Yes. Don't tempt me.

(the waiter goes to the other table)

LAVELLE: So, are they working on crew evaluations?

BEN: Yep.

SITO: Who are they talking about?

BEN: It's not my place to say.

SITO: Come on, Ben.

LAVELLE: Please.

BEN: All right, but I'm not sure you two are going to like it.

Apparently, you two are up for the same job.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Lock phasers on target.

SITO: Phasers locked.

DATA: The enemy is firing.

RIKER: Helm, hard to starboard.

LAVELLE: Hard to starboard.

RIKER: Fire phasers.

(a pause as she finds the right buttons)

SITO: Firing.

DATA: Target is destroyed.

RIKER: End simulation sequence. Secure from drill. Alpha shift, your

response time was seven percent slower than the gamma shift. All

departments, submit drill evaluation reports

[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: By oh nine hundred hours.

LAFORGE: Ensign, you'll write that report.

TAURIK: Yes, sir.

[Bridge]

RIKER: What happened back there, Ensign?

SITO: I'm sorry, sir. When we changed course I had to re-lock phasers

before I could fire.

RIKER: Next time, try letting the locking relay float until the actual

order to fire is given. They may not teach that trick at the Academy,

but it works.

SITO: Thank you, sir.

RIKER: Lavelle.

LAVELLE: Sir?

RIKER: Resume previous course and speed.

LAVELLE: Aye, aye, sir.

RIKER: One aye is sufficient acknowledgment, Ensign.

(Picard enters)

PICARD: Helm, change course for the Argaya system, maximum warp.

LAVELLE: Aye, sir.

RIKER: What happened to the rendezvous with the Clement?

PICARD: I've just received new orders from Starfleet. We'll discuss it

in the Observation lounge. Mister Data, Mister Worf.

RIKER: Ensign Sito, take over at Ops.

SITO: Yes, sir.

(Riker, Data, Worf and Picard leave)

SITO: The Argaya system's close to the Cardassian border. I wonder why

we're going there. How'd you like to be a spider under that table?

LAVELLE: What?

SITO: A spider under the table.

LAVELLE: Is that like a fly on the wall?

SITO: I guess so. You did really well during the drill.

LAVELLE: Well apparently Commander Riker didn't think so. I swear he's

got it in for me.

SITO: You're imagining things.

LAVELLE: Yeah? Then how come you're sitting in that chair instead of

me?

SITO: I guess he figured I need more practice than you do.

[Engineering]

TAURIK: Excuse me, sir. Do you have a minute?

LAFORGE: Sure, Taurik. What is it?

TAURIK: I'd like you to take a look at something.

LAFORGE: Have you been improvising again, Ensign?

TAURIK: In a manner of speaking. I'm running a computer simulation to

test a new warp field configuration.

LAFORGE: You've got a problem here. Your plasma flow to the nacelles is

out of sync.

TAURIK: Actually, sir, that was done deliberately. As you can see, this

configuration has increased overall warp field integrity by seven

percent.

LAFORGE: You're right.

TAURIK: Doctor Nils Diaz has been experimenting with this technique at

the Tanaline Propulsion Laboratory.

LAFORGE: Yeah, I'm familiar with his work, but I never heard anything

about this.

TAURIK: His findings have not been released yet. I was able to review a

preliminary report when I was at the Academy.

LAFORGE: I look forward to reading about it

TAURIK: I predict that when these findings are made public, they will

become a new model for warp field operation.

LAFORGE: Sounds interesting.

TAURIK: With your permission, sir, I'd like to begin tests to see if

the technique can be adapted to our warp drive.

LAFORGE: There might be variables that you didn't account for.

TAURIK: I was quite thorough.

LAFORGE: I'm sure you were, but I'd still need to see your simulation

before I authorise any tests.

TAURIK: As you wish.

LAFORGE: If you have any other ideas for increasing efficiency, don't

hesitate to run them by me.

TAURIK: As a matter of fact, sir, I do. When would be a good time to

discuss them?

LAFORGE: I'll get back to you on that.

[Crusher's office]

OGAWA: Excuse me, Doctor.

CRUSHER: If you're wondering about the evaluations, things couldn't be

better.

OGAWA: Actually, I just wanted to tell you that Ensign Reilly's

condition is showing improvement. But thank you.

CRUSHER: In fact, I'm recommending you for a promotion. How does

Lieutenant Alyssa Ogawa sound?

OGAWA: It sounds wonderful.

CRUSHER: I'll talk to Commander Riker and I'm sure it'll be official as

soon as the current crew evaluations are over. Oh, Alyssa, how are

things going between you and Lieutenant Powell?

OGAWA: Fine. I think.

CRUSHER: You think?

OGAWA: I'm sure it's nothing, but he seems preoccupied lately. Last

night he had to cancel our date.

CRUSHER: I see.

OGAWA: He's been putting together a research proposal. He's been really

busy with it.

CRUSHER: I know what that's like. Sometimes I get so busy with research

I forget to eat.

OGAWA: I just wonder.

CRUSHER: What? Sit down.

OGAWA: I've never met anyone like Andrew. It's as though we've known

each other forever.

CRUSHER: You do seem very well suited.

OGAWA: But I know that in the beginning of a romance it's possible to

be a little blind.

CRUSHER: I'm not sure I know what you mean.

OGAWA: Well, cancelling a date like that, the way he's been so distant

lately. Doctor, do you think those could be warning signs that he's

losing interest?

CRUSHER: Alyssa, I think you're overreacting.

OGAWA: Maybe so.

CRUSHER: If I cared as much about someone as much as you care about

Andrew, he'd have to do a lot more than cancel a date before I'd get

suspicious.

OGAWA: You're right.

CRUSHER: I'm sure that when this research is over, things will be back

just the way they were.

OGAWA: Except, of course, that he'll have to deal with Lieutenant

Ogawa.

[Ten Forward]

(at the bar)

SITO: I only filled in at Ops for a half hour, but I had to degauss the

main deflector dish, recalibrate the navigation grid, and use internal

sensors to find a lost puppy.

WORF: Ops is a very different challenge from Tactical.

SITO: I can't figure out why I'm even being considered for this

assignment. I'm a security officer.

WORF: I recommended you.

SITO: I'll try not to let you down, sir.

(at a table)

LAVELLE: What could they be talking about?

TAURIK: Have you ever considered learning to lip read?

LAVELLE: You think Worf's chewing her out?

BEN: No, he always looks like that.

LAVELLE: Maybe he's giving her pointers on how to land the Ops

position.

(Riker enters)

BEN: Hi, Will.

RIKER: Ben. (to bartender) How you doing?

LAVELLE: You call him Will?

BEN: Why not?

LAVELLE: He's second in command of this ship, that's why not.

BEN: I'm not Starfleet, I'm a civilian. When he's in here, he wants to

be treated like a civilian.

LAVELLE: Riker? I bet he sleeps in his uniform.

BEN: You only think that because he's your CO. If you got to know him.

LAVELLE: Right.

TAURIK: He's convinced Commander Riker doesn't like him.

BEN: Why? Did you crash the ship into something?

LAVELLE: No. He just doesn't like me.

TAURIK: He doesn't even know you.

BEN: That's right. You should go talk to him.

LAVELLE: About what?

TAURIK: Perhaps something you have in common.

BEN: He likes Jazz, poker. He's Canadian.

LAVELLE: Yeah? My grandfather was from Canada.

BEN: There you go.

SITO: Hi.

LAVELLE: Excuse me, I've got to go talk to somebody.

(at the bar)

LAVELLE: Good evening, sir.

RIKER: Lavelle. Something I can do for you?

LAVELLE: No, sir. I just came to get another drink.

RIKER: Is there something wrong with that one?

LAVELLE: No, actually, I, er. What are you having?

RIKER: Trakian Ale.

LAVELLE: Good choice. I'll have one, too. My grandfather was Canadian,

you know.

RIKER: Really?

LAVELLE: Aren't you one, too?

RIKER: A grandfather?

LAVELLE: No, Canadian, sir. Canadian.

RIKER: No, I grew up in Alaska.

LAVELLE: Oh. Well, they both get a lot of snow.

RIKER: Yeah.

LAVELLE: It was good talking to you, sir.

(Lavelle leaves)

BARTENDER: Your ale, Ensign.

[Bridge]

RIKER: We're holding position in the Argaya System.

PICARD: Anything?

WORF: No, sir. I detect no vessels in the vicinity.

PICARD: How close to the Cardassian border are we?

DATA: Less than five thousand kilometres, sir.

WORF: Sir, I am detecting an object five metres in length. It appears

to be an escape pod.

RIKER: They must have been forced to abandon the ship.

PICARD: How far inside Cardassian space is it?

WORF: Fifty thousand kilometres.

PICARD: How the hell are we going to get it out of there?

DATA: Sir, the pod's life support system is failing.

RIKER: Notify Doctor Crusher.

PICARD: Can we get within transporter range without crossing into

Cardassian territory?

DATA: We would need to boost the gain on the confinement beam by at

least seven percent.

PICARD: Mister La Forge?

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I'm on it, Captain. There, try that.

TAURIK: The pod is still too far away.

LAFORGE: I'm going to try augmenting the frequency spread.

TAURIK: Bio readings indicate that passenger's humanoid. Attempting

life form identification.

LAFORGE: No one told you to do that, Ensign. Let's just get him aboard

safely. There, that should do it.

TAURIK: Confinement beam's at one hundred nine percent of normal.

LAFORGE: Transporter room, you should be able to get a lock now.

CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir.

[Sickbay]

PICARD [OC]: Doctor Crusher, are you ready?

CRUSHER: Stand by. Alyssa, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to

leave now.

OGAWA: All right, Doctor.

(Alyssa leaves)

CRUSHER: Transporter room. go ahead.

CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir.

[Corridor]

(Sito is standing guard)

OGAWA: What are you doing here?

SITO: I'm not supposed to let anyone but the senior officers inside

Sickbay.

OGAWA: Do you have any idea what's going on?

SITO: No, do you?

OGAWA: I'd better go.

(Alyssa leaves as Picard arrives)

PICARD: Ensign.

SITO: Sir.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Twelve hundred hours. Alpha shift is

relieved.

LAVELLE: Excuse me, sir. If you don't mind, I'd like to stay on for

another shift. I could use the training.

RIKER: Now's not the best time.

LAVELLE: Yes, sir.

[Outside Sickbay]

PICARD: Ensign, you're with me.

[Turbolift]

PICARD: Bridge. You are a certified pilot, Ensign?

SITO: Yes, sir.

[Ready room]

PICARD: How long have you served on board the

Enterprise, Ensign?

SITO: Seven months, sir.

PICARD: I see I understand that you've been recommended for the Ops

position. Do you think you're up to it?

SITO: I do, sir.

PICARD: I'm not so sure. I'm concerned about your record.

SITO: Sir?

PICARD:  The incident that you were

involved in at the Academy.

SITO: With all due respect that was three years ago. My record since

then

PICARD: It doesn't matter how long ago it was, Ensign. Would you do

something like that again?

SITO: I can assure you, sir, that I would never, never jeopardise lives

by participating in

PICARD: A dare devil stunt? I would certainly hope not. What concerns

me is that you participated in a

cover-up that impeded an official investigation into the death of a

cadet.

SITO: Sir, I know I should have told the truth right from the start

PICARD: Yes you should, but you didn't. Instead you joined with the

others to pretended that was simply an accident. Now, what do you think

that tells me about your character?

SITO: Sir, if you had any idea what it was like after that incident. I

didn't have any friends. I didn't have anyone to talk to. I had to take

my flight test with the instructor because no one else would be my

partner. In a lot of ways it would have been easier to just walk away,

but I didn't. I stuck with it. Doesn't that say something about my

character, too?

PICARD: Well I'm really very sorry you didn't enjoy your time at the

Academy, Ensign. As far as I'm concerned, you should have been expelled

for what you did. Quite frankly, I don't know how you made it on board

this ship. You're dismissed.

[Shuttlebay]

(Taurik is firing a laser rifle at shuttlecraft

Curie from the gantry)

LAFORGE: Another two seconds. Okay, that's enough.

TAURIK: Sir, I'm a little puzzled. Why are we intentionally damaging

the shuttlecraft?

LAFORGE: We're evaluating hull resiliency. Starfleet requires periodic

testing.

TAURIK: I see. I don't believe I'm familiar with that requirement.

LAFORGE: Probably because you're not a senior officer.

TAURIK: If you wish, I could reconfigure the phaser to fire a low

intensity burst that would not harm the shuttle's hull. The test

procedure would not be affected.

LAFORGE: It's fine the way it is. Now, give me another burst, about

four seconds, right here.

TAURIK: Do you want me to fire from this position?

LAFORGE: Actually, why don't you do it from over here.

TAURIK: That would be consistent.

LAFORGE: Consistent with what?

TAURIK: With making it appear that this shuttle had fled an attack.

LAFORGE: What makes you think that's what we're doing?

TAURIK: The pattern of fire you have asked for is similar to what might

result if the shuttle had fled an attacker while engaging in evasive

manoeuvres.

LAFORGE: It's an amazing coincidence.

TAURIK: Yes, sir. It is indeed. Shall we proceed with the testing?

LAFORGE: Yes, Ensign. Thank you.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Alyssa, thank you for coming so quickly.

We have to prepare for surgery. We have a comatose patient with a

subdural hematoma.

OGAWA: Yes, sir.

CRUSHER: I want to make it clear that you are not to discuss what you

see here with anyone.

OGAWA: I understand.

(their patient is a spoon-head)

CRUSHER: We'll need to synthesise at least a litre of Cardassian blood.

[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

(five card stud game in progress)

BEN: It's your bet, Taurik. What I can't understand is why we're just

sitting here so close to the Cardassian border.

LAVELLE: It must have something to do with that escape pod we picked

up. Don't you think, Sito?

SITO: Maybe.

LAVELLE: I wonder who was in it?

BEN: You know what I heard? It was Ambassador Spock.

TAURIK: That is most unlikely.

BEN: That's what I was told.

TAURIK: By whom?

BEN: I can't say.

LAVELLE: They beamed whoever was in it right to Sickbay. Did you see

anything when you went down there?

OGAWA: No. Doctor Crusher just asked me to help her with the laboratory

schedule.

TAURIK: I thought Lieutenant Powell was going to join us tonight?

OGAWA: He had to do a double shift.

LAVELLE: That's too bad. He must be the worst poker player I've ever

met.

BEN: It's your bet, Sam.

(with four clubs showing, Lavelle checks his hole card and grins)

[Riker's quarters]

(another poker game)

WORF: Twenty.

CRUSHER: The thing is, I saw Powell in Ten Forward with another woman,

and the way they were talking it made me wonder.

TROI: Well, if he's seeing someone else he should tell Alyssa. I mean,

it might hurt her now, but it would be better in the long run.

RIKER: I've been meaning to talk to you about something, Mister Worf. I

don't think Ensign Sito's prepared for the Ops position.

WORF: Well, I must say I disagree, sir.

LAFORGE: Counsellor. Pair of fours bets.

RIKER: I'm listening.

[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

BEN: The bet is fifty.

TAURIK: It would be illogical for the Captain to deny you a promotion

for something you did as a cadet.

SITO: He said it shows I don't have character.

OGAWA: What did you say?

SITO: What could I say? Maybe he's right.

LAVELLE: Hey, you're a damn fine officer and you deserve that post as

much as anyone. One thing's for sure, I won't be getting it. Not if

it's up to Riker.

[Riker's quarters]

WORF: It is your decision, sir, but I am certain if

you give Ensign Sito a chance to prove herself, she will not disappoint

you.

RIKER: Very well, I'll take her under consideration. Besides, I'm not

convinced about Lavelle.

TROI: Really? Why?

RIKER: He's too eager to please. He's always trying to ingratiate

himself to me.

TROI: Why assume he's doing it that to get the job?

LAFORGE: Fifty.

RIKER: There's your fifty, and one hundred more.

TROI: I don't know. It seems to me that you and Lavelle are a lot

alike.

RIKER: What? We're not at all alike.

LAFORGE: You're bluffing.

[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

LAVELLE: You think so?

BEN: Yes, and I'm not going to let you get away with it.

OGAWA: You know, Sam, maybe you shouldn't try so hard with Riker. It

doesn't matter whether he likes you as long as he respects you.

SITO: He must, otherwise he would not be considering you for the Ops

position.

LAVELLE: You're probably right. Maybe I'm just telling myself he hates

me so that if I don't get promoted, I'll have an excuse.

BEN: You in or not?

TAURIK: At this juncture, the odds of my winning this hand are less

than thirty nine to one. I fold.

[Riker's quarters]

LAFORGE: The Commander's flush is still working. No

help, Worf. Tens and deuces for the Doctor. And Jacks and fours for the

Counsellor. Ah, three sixes.

WORF: Fold.

RIKER: Looks like it's just you and me. You going to go another fifty?

LAFORGE: I'm thinking. Give me a second, here.

TROI: Didn't you tell me that you took up poker so you could be the

officer's game at the Potemkin?

RIKER: I happen to like poker.

TROI: But your senior officers might have thought you were trying to

ingratiate yourself. I guess it's lucky that they realised you were

young and inexperienced, and decided not to hold it against you.

RIKER: Maybe I have been a little hard on Lavelle.

WORF: I do not believe he is bluffing.

LAFORGE: I do. There you go. What've you got?

WORF: Flush.

LAFORGE: I can't believe this.

RIKER: I am your worst nightmare.

[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

(Lavelle has sevens and sixes, and a queen)

BEN: I knew it.

LAVELLE: How could you tell I was bluffing?

BEN: You don't really expect me to answer that, do you?

SITO: Look, it's getting late. Maybe we should all get some sleep.

BEN: One more hand.

[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Come on, Geordi. You don't have to quit just

because I'm unbeatable?

LAFORGE: Nah, there's something I need to do down in Engineering. I'll

get you next time.

RIKER: I'll be there.

LAFORGE: Goodnight, everybody.

TROI + CRUSHER: Goodnight.

[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

SITO: Bye.

LAVELLE: Goodnight.

OGAWA: See you later.

(Sito and Ogawa leave)

TAURIK: What I find curious is that when Commander La Forge saw that

the technique I was using was actually more efficient, he seemed

annoyed.

BEN: Of course he was.

LAVELLE: He didn't like the fact that you knew something he didn't.

TAURIK: Do you think I have irreparably damaged my relationship with

him?

LAVELLE: It depends on what kind of a guy he is.

BEN: Ante up, gentlemen.

(doorbell) LAVELLE: Come in.

(La Forge enters)

LAVELLE: Commander.

LAFORGE: As you were. I just dropped by to see Taurik.

TAURIK: What can I do for you, sir?

LAFORGE: Well, I'm headed for Engineering to run those tests on the

nacelles. Since you've already put in some work on the technique, I

thought you might like to give me a hand.

TAURIK: I'd be pleased to, sir.

LAFORGE: Great. Let's go.

(La Forge and Taurik leave)

BEN: How about some blackjack?

LAVELLE: I've got to get some sleep so I can be sharp tomorrow.

BEN: Why? So you can get promoted, have more responsibility, and have

to get to sleep even earlier?

LAVELLE: Goodnight.

[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Come in.

CRUSHER: Ben. What are you doing here?

BEN: I just cleaned out some junior officers and I thought I'd do the

same here.

RIKER: You're welcome to give it a try.

TROI: Pull up a chair.

BEN: Thanks.

[Gymnasium]

(a martial arts class has just finished)

WORF: Dismissed. Ensign Sito.

SITO: Yes, sir.

WORF: I also teach an advanced class. I believe you may be ready to

participate. However, before you can join the group, you must pass the

gik'tal.

SITO: Gik'tal?

WORF: Yes. It is a very ancient Klingon ritual. It tests your knowledge

of the forms of the mok'bara.

SITO: I should practice first.

WORF: No. No practise. That is part of the ritual. The test must be

unannounced.

(Worf blindfolds her)

WORF: Can you see?

SITO: No.

WORF: Good. The gik'tal has begun. Defend yourself.

(of course, he easily throws her)

WORF: You must anticipate my attack.

SITO: Yes, sir.

WORF: Defend yourself.

(once again, she has no idea where he is before she lands on her back)

WORF: Are you listening, Ensign?

SITO: Yes, but

WORF: Defend yourself.

(and a third time)

WORF: You did not anticipate.

(Sito removes the blindfold)

SITO: How am I supposed to defend myself when I can't see a thing?

WORF: Stop making excuses. Replace the blindfold.

SITO: No. It's not a fair test.

WORF: Very good, Ensign. You have passed the challenge.

SITO: What? By taking off the blindfold?

WORF: It takes courage to say the test is unfair.

SITO: One thing I don't understand. Doesn't gik'tal mean to the death?

WORF: You speak Klingon.

SITO: Sir, is there really such a thing as a gik'tal challenge?

WORF: No, there is not. But perhaps next time you are judged unfairly,

it will not take so many bruises for you protest.

[Ready room]

SITO: All I've ever wanted is to make a career for

myself in Starfleet. I can't change what happened at the Academy. No

one can. All I can do is work hard and try to earn the respect of the

people I serve with. If you're not going to give me that chance, then I

respectfully request that you transfer me to another ship.

PICARD: If you're looking for a more lenient commander, I don't think

you'll find one.

SITO: Permission to speak freely, sir?

PICARD: Please do.

SITO: If you didn't want me on your ship you should have said so when I

was assigned to it. It's not your place to punish me for what I did at

the Academy. I've worked hard here. My record is exemplary. If you're

going to judge me, judge me for what I am now.

PICARD: Very well, Ensign. I will. It took courage to come here and

face me after what I said to you the other day. I didn't ask you here

because I was assessing your qualifications for the Ops position.

SITO: I don't understand, sir.

PICARD: I was harsh with you because I wanted to assess you for a very

important mission. A mission that could put you in a situation that

would be far more unnerving than a dressing-down by your commanding

officer.

SITO: Can I ask what that mission is, sir?

PICARD: Join the senior officers in the Observation lounge at oh nine

hundred hours. We'll discuss it then.

SITO: Yes, sir.

PICARD: And, Ensign. I do know why you ended up on the Enterprise. I

asked for you. I wanted to make sure that you got a fair chance to

redeem yourself.

SITO: Thank you, sir.

[Sickbay]

OGAWA: You wanted to see me, Doctor?

CRUSHER: Yes. Alyssa, I think you know how much I've come to depend

upon you here. I've recommended your promotion because your performance

here has been exemplary.

OGAWA: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that.

CRUSHER: But more than that, I've come to think of you as a friend.

Someone I really care about.

OGAWA: That's nice of you to say. I feel the same way.

CRUSHER: So, you and Andrew Powell?

OGAWA: Someone told you.

CRUSHER: Told me what?

OGAWA: We were going to keep it a secret until the promotions are

announced.

CRUSHER: Secret?

OGAWA: He asked me to marry him.

CRUSHER: Alyssa, that's wonderful! I'm so relieved. I mean happy.

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: Please, take a seat, Ensign.

(then she sees the Cardassian)

PICARD: This is Joret Dal. He was in the escape pod that we retrieved.

He is a member of the Cardassian military, and a Federation operative.

He has risked his life to bring us invaluable information about

Cardassian strategic intentions. Information that could very well

enhance the security of Bajor, as well as other planets in this sector.

Now, it is absolutely imperative that we return him safely back to

Cardassian space.

JORET: It will not be easy. The border is heavily guarded.

RIKER: As his ship was destroyed, he'll be using one of our shuttles.

JORET: If a patrol stops me, I will claim to have stolen it.

WORF: We have distressed the shuttle so that it appears to have been

fired upon.

RIKER: Joret will attempt to talk his way past the patrol.

JORET: If I were alone, the chances of my succeeding would be slim. But

if I had a prisoner with me, a Bajoran terrorist, I would appear to be

a bounty hunter. Border crossings of that nature are not uncommon, and

for a price the patrol can be convinced to look the other way.

PICARD: Once the shuttle is safely past the patrol, Joret will put you

into an escape pod and return you back across the border.

RIKER: Since the pod is so small, it will be difficult to detect.

PICARD: We'll be waiting here to pick you up.

SITO: I understand, sir.

PICARD: Ensign, this is obviously a very dangerous mission. I'm not

ordering you to take part in it.

SITO: Then I volunteer, sir.

WORF: Be certain you understand the risk you are taking. If you are

captured

SITO: I'm Bajoran. No one knows better than I do what Cardassians do to

their prisoners. I've made my decision.

PICARD: Very well, Ensign. Will you report to Sickbay. Doctor Crusher

will explain. And Ensign Sito, I must ask you not to discuss this

mission with anyone.

SITO: Yes, sir.

(Sito leaves)

JORET: I didn't realise she would be so young.

[Shuttlebay]

SITO: The Captain asked Doctor Crusher to make it

look like Joret had mistreated me.

(she's got bruises on her face)

LAFORGE: We're all set here.

(La Forge leaves)

SITO: Sir. I want you to know that I really appreciate the fact that

you've always had confidence in me.

WORF: Good luck.

SITO: I'll see you soon.

[Shuttlecraft]

JORET: We are approaching the border. It won't be

long before we're detected by the patrol ships.

SITO: When they stop us, do you want me to say anything?

JORET: No. It should seem that I've broken your will. If you're asked

any questions, look at me as though you're afraid to answer.

SITO: Can I ask you something? Why are you doing this, risking your

life to help Starfleet?

JORET: I don't consider myself a traitor, if that's what you're asking.

All my life I've served in the military. Once it was an institution

dedicated to the security of Cardassia, now it's little more than a

platform for ambitious Guls hoping to make their reputations in battle.

If the information I provided helps Starfleet deter even one pointless

skirmish, I've served my purpose. I'm sick of war. My people need

peace.

SITO: I never thought I'd hear a Cardassian say something like that.

JORET: And I never thought a Bajoran would risk her life to help a

Cardassian get home.

SITO: Patrol ships moving in on our position.

JORET: We don't have much time.

(he shackles her wrists)

[Ten Forward]

LAVELLE: She must have left on that shuttle.

There's no other explanation.

BEN: Do you have any idea where it went?

LAVELLE: Toward Cardassian space. That's what I'm worried about. Oh,

there's one other thing, I noticed the shuttle was damaged.

OGAWA: Sam, can we talk about something else?

LAVELLE: Well don't you care what's happened to her?

OGAWA: Of course.

TAURIK: But we have to accept the fact that we're not always told about

everything that happens aboard ship.

LAVELLE: Well, we can at least tell each other what we know. Do you two

know something?

OGAWA: Sam, please.

LAVELLE: I can't believe this. We're friends.

TAURIK: We're also Starfleet Officers.

OGAWA: I'm not allowed to talk about it.

LAVELLE: Okay. I understand. I'd better get going. I've got duty in

half an hour.

Captain's log, stardate 47566.7. We have reached

the coordinates in Federation space where Ensign Sito's escape pod was

to have rendezvoused with us. However, we have been waiting for over

thirty hours and as yet there is no sign of her.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Report.

LAVELLE: We completed a long range scan of the area, sir. The escape

pod doesn't seem to be out there.

DATA: It is possible that at this distance we are unable to distinguish

the pod from the inorganic matter normally present in space.

RIKER: Try narrowing the scan field. See if you can pick up any

biosigns.

LAVELLE: Sir, it would help if I knew what kind of life signs to look

for.

RIKER: You're scanning for Bajoran lifesigns.

LAVELLE: Yes, sir.

(Picard enters)

RIKER: Nothing yet. The pod is thirty two hours overdue.

WORF: Sir, I recommend we launch a probe to increase the range of our

sensor sweeps.

RIKER: Launching a probe into Cardassian space would be a treaty

violation.

PICARD: Mister Worf, prepare a probe and launch when ready.

WORF: Aye, sir. Probe launched, sir.

DATA: Sir, I am detecting signs of debris two hundred thousand

kilometres inside Cardassian space. Its mass and composition indicate

it could be the remains of a Federation escape pod.

Captain's log, supplemental. We have intercepted a

Cardassian report stating that a Bajoran prisoner escaped her captor

and was killed in an evacuation pod as she tried to leave Cardassian

space.

[Ready room]

PICARD: To all Starfleet personnel, this is the

Captain. It is my sad duty to inform you that a member of the crew,

Ensign Sito Jaxa

[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Has been lost

[Sickbay]

PICARD [OC]: In the line of duty. She was the

finest example of a Starfleet

[Bridge]

PICARD [OC]: Officer, and a young woman of

remarkable courage

[Ready room]

PICARD: And strength of character. Her loss will be

deeply felt by all who knew her. Picard out.

[Ten Forward]

(the atmosphere is well, sad)

BEN: You okay?

LAVELLE: I just got promoted.

OGAWA: Congratulations.

LAVELLE: Thanks. It just don't feel right. For all I know, she was

going to get the promotion instead of me.

BEN: You shouldn't feel that way, Sam.

OGAWA: She would have been happy for you, Sam.

TAURIK: The best way to remember her would be to excel in your new

position.

OGAWA: We're proud of you, Sam.

BEN: Excuse me, sir, but I need to move this table.

WORF: What?

BEN: There's an empty seat over there.

WORF: I appreciate what you are trying to do, but it is not

appropriate. You were her friends. I was only her commanding officer.

BEN: Sir, I happen to know that she considered you a friend.

(so Worf joins the youngsters remembering Sito)

Stardate:

47611.2

Original Airdate: 14 Feb, 1994

  Bridge

Officer's log, stardate 47611.2. Doctor Beverly Crusher reporting. We

have rendezvoused with Counsellor Troi's shuttlecraft. She has just

returned from a three day class reunion on Starbase two three one.

[Bridge]

(nightshift, with 'Captain' Crusher in command)

CRUSHER: Send a message to Commander Data and inform him of our delay.

RAINER: Aye, sir.

(Troi enters)

CRUSHER: Deanna, welcome back.

TROI: Thank you. I was just reporting in. I didn't expect to find

anyone up except Data.

CRUSHER: Data's away on assignment. A Federation deep space probe went

off course and crashed on Barkon Four. Some of the material in the

casing was radioactive, so Data was sent to recover it before it could

contaminate the biosphere.

TROI: Isn't Barkon Four inhabited?

CRUSHER: Yes, it's a pre-industrial society, but the probe crashed over

a hundred kilometres from the nearest settlement so Data shouldn't have

any contact with the Barkonians. So, how was the reunion?

TROI: Fine. It was good to see some old friends. I'd lost touch with

most of them. It's interesting to see the different paths some of their

lives have taken. Beverly, you don't usually stand a watch on the

Bridge even when Data's not here.

CRUSHER: I volunteered tonight. I like to put in a little Bridge time

now and then, stay on top of operations, tactical procedures. The truth

is, I like it. It's not every doctor who gets to command a starship,

even if it is the night shift.

TROI: May I ask you a personal question? Why did you decide to become a

Commander? I mean, you didn't need the rank in order to be Chief

Medical Officer, so why put yourself through all the extra work?

CRUSHER: Oh, I don't know. I never even thought about my rank for a

long time. It seemed pretty trivial compared to being a doctor. But

then, about eight years ago, I started to feel like I wanted to stretch

myself a little.

RAINER: Commander, there's no response from Commander Data to our

signal.

CRUSHER: Continue sending him updates on our schedule.

RAINER: Aye, sir.

TROI: Is something wrong?

CRUSHER: No. I wanted to let Data know there'd be a delay in picking

him up for a few of days. We have orders to rendezvous with the

Lexington and take some medical supplies to the Taranko Colony.

TROI: But he's not responding.

CRUSHER: Geordi said that the radiation from the probe might interfere

with communications. I just thought I'd try anyway.

[Town square]

(early morning in the Renaissance)

GARVIN: So when you return from school tonight, I'll be meeting with

the village elders.

GIA: Again?

GARVIN: Gia.

GIA: I know, I know. You're the town magistrate and you have a lot of

work to do, but it always seems like you're always in some meeting or

(enter Data, disheveled, carrying a box and making a strange noise)

GARVIN: Gia, go home. Now. Who are you? What do you want?

(Gia hides to watch)

DATA: (trying to imitate the words) Who are you? What do you want?

GARVIN: What's wrong with you?

DATA: What's wrong with you?

GARVIN: There's nothing wrong with me. Who are you? What is your name?

Can you understand me? My name is Garvin.

DATA: My name is Garvin?

(Gia giggles)

GARVIN: I thought I told you to go home.

GIA: I know.

DATA: I do not know my name.

GARVIN: What?

DATA: You asked if I knew my name. I do not.

GARVIN: Well at least you seem to be understanding a little more.

DATA: Yes. It is becoming easier.

GIA: Ask him where he's from, father.

GARVIN: Gia, go on to school. I'll deal with the stranger.

GIA: Yes, Father. Goodbye.

DATA: Goodbye.

GARVIN: Your eyes and skin look so strange. Your clothes, you look like

you've been in some kind of accident.

DATA: I do not remember being in an accident.

GARVIN: What do you remember?

DATA: I walked here from the mountains.

GARVIN: The mountains? The mountains are over two hundred seltons from

here.

DATA: I have a clear memory of my journey.

GARVIN: What do you remember before that?

DATA: I have no prior memory.

GARVIN: Do you know what that is?

(referring to the box marked Radioactive that Data is carrying)

DATA: No.

GARVIN: May I? May I have it?

DATA: Yes.

GARVIN: There might be something in here that can tell us who you are.

GARVIN: I wonder what these markings mean.

DATA: Radioactive.

GARVIN: What?

DATA: That is what is written on the container.

GARVIN: You can read this language?

DATA: Evidently.

GARVIN: Radioactive. What does that mean?

DATA: I do not know. Perhaps it is my name.

GARVIN: I've never heard a name like that. You must come from a very

distant place.

(Garvin opens the box and takes out a piece of shiny metal)

[Riker's quarters]

(Riker is practising his trombone when Troi strolls

in. He finishes the piece and then blows two notes)

TROI: Is that supposed to be a question?

(parp parp)

TROI: Because if you're asking me if I liked what you were playing,

then the answer is yes.

(paarp parp)

TROI: You know, this is a much better way of communicating for you.

It's far less confusing than the way you normally speak.

(parp!)

RIKER: I knew I could count on my Imzadi, the ship's Counsellor to

boost my self-image.

TROI: I'm glad to be of service.

RIKER: Did you come here for something in particular, or just general

Riker bashing?

TROI: Actually I wanted to ask your opinion about something. I've been

thinking about taking the Bridge Officer's test and becoming a full

Commander.

RIKER: What brought this up?

TROI: A lot of things. Working on the personnel review last month,

talking with Beverly about her experiences, going to my class reunion.

RIKER: Ah, the class reunion. You saw a few old friends who had already

taken the test?

TROI: All right, I admit it was a catalyst. But I can honestly say that

I've been thinking about this off and on over the past two years.

RIKER: Why the past two years?

TROI: Do you remember when the Enterprise hit that quantum filament and

I was in command on the Bridge?

RIKER: I do.

TROI: Well, when that happened, I was overwhelmed. But when it was over

I realised that a part of me missed it.

Not the actual disaster, but the experience of being in command. I felt

like I was exploring a whole new side of myself. Not that I want to

give up counselling by any means, but I really would like to stretch

myself a little.

RIKER: Deanna, if you take the Bridge Officer's test, you'll have my

complete support. But as First Officer, I'll be the one judging your

performance, and you should know I am a pretty tough judge.

TROI: And I'm a pretty good student.

RIKER: We'll start tomorrow morning, oh eight hundred hours.

[Garvin's home]

(the local medicine woman is checking him over)

TALUR: Remarkable set of teeth. Breath smells like, well, it doesn't

have any smell actually. You can close your mouth. Let's see. Heartbeat

sounds a little odd, but seems very regular. Skin feels clammy, but you

say you feel fine?

DATA: That is correct.

TALUR: No headaches, palpitations, sluggishness, indigestion?

DATA: No. But I cannot have indigestion since I have not eaten.

TALUR: Ah. Malnutrition. You should try to eat something that will

build strength and return your vitality. Lots of meat, butter, cheese,

that should be a start.

GARVIN: What about his eyes and his skin? They're so odd.

TALUR: Quite so, quite so. I'm sure my grandmother would have called

our friend here a demon or spirit or some kind of monster. But current

scientific methodology allows us to dismiss such ridiculous

superstitions and concentrate on scientific reality.

DATA: Then what do you believe I am?

TALUR: You are an ice man.

DATA: Ice man?

TALUR: Yes. You probably come from a race of people who lived in the

snow and ice of the Vellorian mountains. Your skin and eye colouration

are a result of prolonged exposure to harsh winter conditions.

DATA: Then I am not ill?

TALUR: Aside from your memory loss, you do not seem to have any

symptoms of any illness that I am familiar with. No. You are an ice

man. Now, get something to eat and a good night's rest, and I will come

back tomorrow to see if your memory has begun to return.

DATA: Thank you.

TALUR: Hello, Gia.

GIA: Hello.

(Talur leaves as Gia enters)

GIA: What did Talur say about him? Is he sick?

GARVIN: Not exactly. She said he's lost his memory, but seems to be

fine otherwise. Talur thinks he's from a race that lives in the

mountains.

DATA: I am an ice man.

GARVIN: We'll have to call you something besides Ice man until your

memory returns. What was the word on the container?

DATA: Radioactive.

GARVIN: Mister Radioactive?

GIA: I don't like that name. Let's call him Jayden.

GARVIN: What do you think of that?

DATA: Jayden. That is acceptable.

GARVIN: Right now, we need to clean him up and get him something decent

to wear. Run upstairs and get some of my old clothes for him.

GIA: Yes, Father.

GARVIN: I wonder if Skoran can tell us something about this metal of

yours.

[Town square]

(at the blacksmith's forge)

SKORAN: You, Ice man, where'd you find this?

DATA: I do not know.

GARVIN: I told you, he's lost his memory and we're calling him Jayden

for now.

SKORAN: Jayden, huh? The metal is slightly warm.

GARVIN: All the fragments are like that.

(Skoran hit's it with a hammer on the anvil)

SKORAN: It's obviously been tempered and milled. The lustrous quality

of the metal is so pure. This wasn't made in any forge I've ever seen.

Will you sell them?

GARVIN: You want them?

SKORAN: The metal's malleable enough to make some jewellry.

GARVIN: They belong to Jayden. Do you want to sell them? You're going

to need money.

DATA: You may be right. But I do not wish to sell all the fragments.

They may provide a clue to my identity.

SKORAN: I'll give you twenty doraks for half the lot.

GARVIN: Agreed.

(the wooden base of the anvil cracks, and the anvil falls on the

apprentice's leg)

APPRENTICE: My leg! My leg! Get it off! Get it off!

(townsfolk rush to help)

SKORAN: We need a lever.

GARVIN: It'll be all right. Don't struggle. It will only

(Data lifts the anvil easily)

GARVIN: Jayden, put it down.

DATA: I believe the support structure on the anvil collapsed because

some of the wood had rotted. Did I do something wrong, Garvin?

GARVIN: No, just unexpected.

[Garvin's home]

(at evening meal)

TALUR: It's perfectly understandable. Your people probably all have

great strength. It will allow them to fight off the ferocious creatures

that live in the Vellorian Mountains.

DATA: You have told me no one from the village has ever been to the

Vellorian Mountains. How can you be certain there are ferocious

creatures there?

TALUR: It's a well known fact.

DATA: But no one has actually seen one?

TALUR: Well, not to my knowledge, but

GIA: Father, are you all right?

GARVIN: I've been tired since this afternoon. I'm sure it's nothing.

TALUR: You feel slightly warm. Some fresh air and a brisk walk will do

you good.

GARVIN: That sounds like a good idea. I'll be back soon.

(Garvin and Talur leave)

GIA: You didn't like it?

DATA: I neither liked it nor disliked it. I simply had no appetite.

GIA: Father's cooking isn't as good as mother's. He tries, though.

DATA: Where is your mother?

GIA: She died about a year ago. Father says she went to a beautiful

place where everything is peaceful and everyone loves each other, and

no one ever gets sick. Do you think there's really a place like that?

(Data gazes out at the moon and stars)

DATA: Yes. I do.

[Holodeck - Engineering]

(at red alert)

LAFORGE: We just lost contact with everything above deck twenty one,

including the Bridge.

WORF: There is something wrong with one of the antimatter containment

units. The magnetic field is starting to fluctuate.

TROI: Switch to auxiliary control.

WORF: Auxiliary control is not online. We are starting to lose

containment on antimatter storage unit three.

TROI: All right. Switch the EM power inverter to the lateral. No, wait.

Use the neodyne relay.

LAFORGE: Commander, the neodyne relay isn't holding. Containment

failure in ten seconds.

TROI: Computer, emergency procedure. Eject antimatter storage unit

three. Authorisation, Troi omega omega three one.

COMPUTER: Unable to comply. All power to ejection systems has been

terminated and cannot be restored.

LAFORGE: Commander, the unit's beginning to o

(flash, simulation ends)

RIKER: Congratulations. You just destroyed the Enterprise.

TROI: Thank you for the encouragement.

RIKER: Don't feel bad. You passed everything else. Diplomatic law,

first contact procedures, Bridge operations. The Engineering

qualification's one of the toughest parts of the test.

TROI: So what did I do wrong?

RIKER: I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

TROI: Why not? What kind of a test is this?

RIKER: It's the kind of a test that you'll have to take again if you

want to be a Bridge Officer. Only next time, the problem won't be so

easy, so I suggest you study up on your emergency procedures.

TROI: Well how do I know what to study if you won't tell me what I did

wrong?

RIKER: I don't know. I'm afraid I can't tell you that either.

[Town square school]

TALUR: Rock, fire, sky, and water are the basic

elements of the universe. They can be found in every object, every

person, every animal, everything. The rock in this wood can be felt by

its weight and by its hardness. If we expose the wood to flame, we can

encourage the fire within the wood to show itself. We can also see

smoke, which is a part of the sky. The water in wood is difficult to

see. Sometimes the elements are buried deep within the objects, but the

four elements are always there. (Data raises his hand) Yes, Jayden?

DATA: I do not believe that is correct.

TALUR: Oh?

DATA: I believe you are reasoning by analogy, classifying objects and

phenomena according to superficial observation rather than empirical

evidence. Wood, for example, does not contain fire simply because it is

combustible, nor does it contain rock simply because it is heavy. Wood,

like any complex organic form, is composed of thousands of different

chemical compounds, none of which is fire.

TALUR: That will be enough for now, Jayden. As I told you earlier, our

friend Jayden here has lost much of his memory, so I wouldn't put too

much faith in any of his ideas. Now that will be all for today. I will

see you tomorrow. Be sure to practice your spelling and arithmetic

tonight.

GIA: Are you all right?

DATA: Yes. But I do not agree with Talur's assessment. Although I do

have gaps in my memory, I know that fire is not an element.

(raised voices at the forge)

GARVIN: That is not what you promised me!

SKORAN: You're getting old, Garvin. I offered you fifteen for the metal

and I've given it to you. No more.

GARVIN: We agreed on twenty.

DATA: Garvin is correct. You agreed on twenty.

SKORAN: Stay out of this, Ice man. Your memory is not very reliable.

(Garvin doubles over)

GIA: Father! Father, what's wrong?

GARVIN: I don't know I feel very weak suddenly.

GIA: You have got a fever. We should get him home.

[Garvin's home]

GIA: What's wrong with him?

TALUR: I suspect he (gets a handful of hair) I don't know. I've never

encountered anything like this before. These lesions look like burn

marks. The fluids of his body have overheated. That would explain the

fever and the burning skin. Keep him cool, let plenty of fresh air into

the house, and I want you to give him these herbs. That will bring his

fluidic temperature down and allow this to pass.

GIA: I understand.

(Data picks up Talur's magnifying glass)

DATA: With an increased focal length and an achromatic objective lens,

this instrument will have a higher effective magnification.

TALUR: I will come back tomorrow and check on you.

GARVIN: Thank you.

(Talur leaves)

DATA: Garvin, with your permission, I would like to begin my own

investigation regarding the cause of your illness.

GARVIN: Go ahead.

DATA: Gia, I would like you to accompany me to the village. I will need

some supplies.

[Town square]

(coming out of a shop)

GIA: What are you going to do with all this?

DATA: I will use these materials to make the laboratory equipment I

need to research your father's illness.

GIA: Do you think you can help him?

DATA: I do not know. First I must isolate the cause of the illness.

SKORAN: There he is! It's his fault! None of us were sick before he

came to the village!

CROWD: True.

DATA: Am I to understand that Garvin's illness has spread?

SKORAN: That's right. And you're the cause.

GIA: That's not true!

DATA: Gia, I think we should leave.

SKORAN: That's it. Leave. Get out of here. Go back where you came from!

[Garvin's home]

(Data has made a new microscope with multiple

lenses and is working when Talur enters)

TALUR: Jayden what are you doing?

DATA: I am studying skin samples from Gia and Garvin in an attempt to

isolate the cause of the illness.

TALUR: Gia?

DATA: Yes. She is also beginning to show signs of the illness.

TALUR: What is that?

DATA: It is a magnifying device based on your hand-held instrument. I

have refined the design to increase the magnification level.

TALUR: May I?

DATA: Of course.

TALUR: How strong is the magnification?

DATA: Objects appear approximately five hundred times their normal

size. As you can see, the cellular damage is quite extensive. However,

based on interstitial transparency and membrane integrity, I do not

believe it is an infection or any other form of communicable disease.

TALUR: I see.

DATA: At the moment, I am looking for a common event or experience that

Gia, Garvin and Skoran might have shared that could have a causal

relationship to their illness.

TALUR: Well they've all lived here in the village for many years. I'm

sure they have many common experiences.

DATA: Yes, but since the illness struck all three in a relatively short

period of time, it is reasonable to assume the experience is recent and

unusual.

TALUR: Actually, Jayden, encountering you has been the most unusual

experience that they've all shared recently.

DATA: I am aware of that. Excuse me. I am also open to the possibility

that I may in some way be the causal factor. However, since you have

had a great deal of contact with me and you show no signs of the

sickness, I tend to discount myself as a likely candidate.

TALUR: Still, it has to be more than just a coincidence that shortly

after you arrived, people started to become ill.

DATA: I agree.

(Gia comes downstairs)

GIA: Jayden I tried to give father his broth, but he won't eat.

TALUR: You have a fever. You should be in bed.

GIA: No, I'm all right. Father needs me.

DATA: Talur is correct. You should rest. I will attend to your father.

Gia, when did you begin wearing that pendant?

GIA: Two days ago. Father bought it from Skoran. Why?

DATA: May I see it? This is one of the metal fragments I sold to

Skoran.

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: The secondary plasma vent has a triple

redundant bypass. Which means that the primary access junction is

routed through

(doorbell)

TROI: Come in. Would be routed through the port transducer matrix. Come

to give me more encouragement?

RIKER: No. I'm actually here to tell you that I've decided to cancel

the rest of your test.

TROI: What?

RIKER: I'm cancelling the test.

TROI: May I ask why?

RIKER: You've taken the Engineering qualification three times. You're

no closer to passing.

TROI: Well, then I'll take it four times, or fourteen times, or however

many times are necessary for me to get it right.

RIKER: Deanna, this is nothing personal. Not everyone is cut out to be

a Bridge Officer. I don't think this is for you.

TROI: Why? Because I'm not the most technically-minded person on the

ship? I may have trouble telling the difference between a plasma

conduit and a phase inducer, but there's more to being a bridge officer

than memorising technical manuals.

RIKER: That's right, there is. You could spend the next month

memorising all the technical manuals in the computer, I still don't

think you'd pass the test.

TROI: Tell me one thing. Is there a solution? Or is this simply a test

of my ability to handle a no-win situation?

RIKER: There is a solution.

TROI: Then give me time to find it.

RIKER: I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the

ship. I cannot let any Bridge Officer serve who's not qualified. I'm

sorry.

(Riker leaves, Troi is angry then the penny drops)

TROI: My first duty is to the ship. The ship!

[Holodeck - Engineering]

TROI: Computer, load Bridge Officer's test,

Engineering qualification section one.

COMPUTER: Computer ready.

TROI: Run programme.

WORF: The control system for the primary containment field is not

functioning.

LAFORGE: Something's severed the ODN conduit between here and the

antimatter storage deck.

TROI: Geordi, could you repair the ODN conduit if you went into the

crawlspace?

WORF: Sir, that crawlway is in a warp-plasma shaft. He would never

survive the radiation.

TROI: I know that. Geordi, could you repair the conduit?

LAFORGE: Yeah, I think I could.

TROI: Then do it. That's an order.

(Geordi exits to the Jefferies tube)

RIKER: End simulation. Something told me you wouldn't let this go.

Congratulations. You passed.

TROI: That's what this was all about, wasn't it? To see if I'd order

someone to their death.

RIKER: That's right.

TROI: I knew that was part of being in command and I thought I'd

prepared for it, but when the moment came I hesitated. Maybe you were

right. Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

RIKER: You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your

options, you tried every alternative, and then you made the hard

choice. Come on, let's get out of here, Commander.

[Garvin's home]

DATA: I have coated this piece of cloth with the

liquid which is used in lamps. As you can see, the cloth becomes

luminescent when it is exposed to an energy source. This pendant also

appears to be an energy source.

(flickers on the cloth)

TALUR: But where is this pattern of light coming from?

DATA: I believe a stream of particles is emanating from the metallic

pendant and hitting the cloth.

TALUR: I don't see any particles coming from the pendant.

DATA: You will see there are. I can even block them.

(Data puts the box in between the pendant and the screen)

DATA: It would appear that this container was constructed of a material

which absorbs or blocks the particles coming from the metal.

TALUR: It's a trick.

DATA: No. It is empirical data. I believe the fragments were originally

placed in this container to protect people from accidental exposure.

The word radioactive may be a warning about the dangerous nature of the

metal.

TALUR: All right. Let's say for the moment that you're right, that

there are invisible particles coming from the metal. What should we do?

DATA: I will continue my experiment. I would like you to gather all the

pieces of metal in the village and place them in this container.

TALUR: All right. But when I return, I want a more thorough explanation

of all this. And I want to examine your data, in detail.

DATA: Of course.

(Talur leaves. A few moments later there is a thumping at the door.

Data opens it.)

SKORAN: There you are. You're the cause of this, Ice man.

DATA: If you are referring to the illness, you are partially correct.

However, it is more complex than that. The metal fragment which

(Data ducks Skoran's attack and sends him against the wall, but his

crony's attack with an axe removes the covering from half of Data's

face)

SKORAN: What, what are you?

(they run away)

DATA: I do not know.

(later, Skoran pours pieces of metal into the box and Talur closes it)

SKORAN: I saw it with my own eyes. He's not a person. He's some kind of

creature.

GIA: It's not true, Father.

SKORAN: We must find him and stop him before he kills us all.

GARVIN: I don't. Not Jayden. He wouldn't try to hurt us.

SKORAN: Come on.

(the armed mob leaves)

TALUR: Let him rest for now. You should rest as well. Exerting yourself

will only make you sicker. I'll be back.

(Talur leaves and Gia goes into the study area. Data is wearing a hood)

DATA: Gia.

GIA: Jayden? Everyone's looking for you. Skoran said you're some kind

of creature.

DATA: I do not know what I am. But I am not like you.

GIA: I know. You're an Ice man. We talked about that.

DATA: No. I am not.

GIA: Jayden, why are you wearing that hood?

DATA: I do not wish to frighten you.

GIA: I won't be afraid. Take it off. Please, I have to see.

(he does, and she recoils at the flashing lights in his face)

DATA: I understand your reaction. But I do not wish to harm you. You or

Garvin or anyone else. I only wish to help, to find a cure for the

illness. I was very close. I must to continue my work, but it will take

time. How long until Skoran and the others return?

GIA: I don't know. They're looking for you now.

DATA: Then I must hurry.

(hours later, Data comes downstairs with a potion in a bowl)

DATA: Gia, I believe I have found the answer.

GIA: You think you found a cure?

DATA: I believe so. I tested this medicine on skin samples from your

father. They showed improvement, so I administered this to him. He is

now recovering.

GIA: What kind of medicine is it?

DATA: A compound I made which will neutralise the particles that are

making you ill. Swallow this. I must administer this to everyone in the

village, but I do not think they will trust me after what happened to

Skoran.

GIA: I could tell them.

DATA: I am afraid they will not believe you either. Gia, is the well in

the town square the only source of water for this village?

GIA: Well?

DATA: This is very important. Are there any other sources of fresh

water near the village?

GIA: No. The nearest river is two days away.

DATA: Then I will put this compound into the well water. It may be

diluted, but it should still have enough potency to work.

GIA: Compound

[Town square]

(night, Data uncovers the well and is about to pour

his bucket of cure into it when)

SKORAN: There he is! You see? It's just as I said.

DATA: I only wish to help.

SKORAN: This is how you've helped us, by bringing this plague? Tried to

kill us all? Well, you won't succeed. I won't let you!

(Data pours the compound into the well just as Skoran impales him and

gets an electric shock for his effort. Data falls as Talur arrives)

[Town square]

(another day, and Gia is going to school with her

slate)

CRUSHER: Excuse me. We're looking for a friend of ours. He might have

wandered into your village a few days ago.

RIKER: You'd remember him. He would have appeared very strange. Pale

skin, gold eyes.

GIA: He was your friend?

CRUSHER: Yes. Do you know him?

RIKER: Where is he?

(Gia points to a plaque on a stone)

CRUSHER: I don't understand.

GIA: We didn't know his real name, so we called him Jayden.

RIKER: You're saying he's dead?

GIA: They killed him because they were afraid of him, but he saved all

of us from the sickness.

CRUSHER: The sickness?

GIA: There were these pieces of metal. They made everyone sick. But

Jayden put something in the water and now everyone's better.

RIKER: What happened to these pieces of metal?

GIA: We buried them in the forest. What was his real name?

RIKER: Data.

GIA: Data. He was my friend, too.

(Gia leaves and Beverly gets her tricorder out)

CRUSHER: It's Data all right. He's buried about two metres down. He's

been deactivated so I can't tell how bad the damage is.

RIKER: We could beam him and the probe fragments right onto the ship.

No one would know.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Positronic net online. Subprocessor relays

in place and neuroelectrical systems enabled.

(she switches him on and he instantly sits up)

CRUSHER: Data, are you all right?

DATA: I do not know. I am surprised to find myself here. I thought I

was on Barkon Four.

PICARD: What's the last thing you remember?

DATA: I had located the crashed Federation probe and collected the

radioactive fragments. I was attempting to download the sensor logs

from the probe's onboard computer. There was a power surge. I believe

the surge overloaded my positronic matrix. After that, I have no memory

until this moment. (looks at his clothes) It appears I had an

interesting time.

RIKER: We don't know much about what happened either. Apparently you

saved an entire village from radiation poisoning.

CRUSHER: And you were a very special friend to a little girl.

TROI: Well, if you'll excuse me, I have the Bridge this watch.

DATA: Counsellor, have you been promoted in my absence?

TROI: That's right. Which means from now on you can call me sir.

DATA: Yes, sir.

Original Airdate: 21 Feb, 1994

  [Classroom]

(it is clay sculpture class)

TROI: (to a girl) That's very good. (to a boy) Well, that's very nice.

ERIC: No, it isn't. I just can't get it right. Do you think the wings

are too big?

TROI: Not at all. Birds have wings of all sizes, Eric. And you

shouldn't worry about making it look perfect.

ERIC: But Mrs Narsu said we should try to make our sculptures as

realistic as possible.

TROI: She's right. It is important that you be able to make the clay

take the shape you want it to have, but you're not supposed to be

concentrating on technique today. I'm here to help you focus on the

feelings you want to convey with your sculpture. For instance, what do

you think about when you see a bird?

ERIC: Flying?

TROI: Fine. So, make your sculpture make me think of flying, too.

(She moves on to the big kid in the class)

TROI: How's it going, Data?

DATA: I have finished.

(it's a perfect PADD)

DATA: The dimensions are accurate to within one point three percent.

TROI: I'm sure they are. Data, you obviously don't have a trouble with

realism, but you're here to work on your imagination. Maybe you should

try something a little more abstract. Here. I want you to start a new

piece. I'd like you to sculpt music.

DATA: Counsellor, music is a collection of acoustic vibrations. How can

I reproduce a sound with clay?

TROI: Well, think of the effects that sounds have on people, the images

that music brings to your mind, and then give it a form.

(he quickly forms a treble clef)

TROI: It's a start.

RIKER [OC]: Riker to Data. Please report to the Bridge.

DATA: Acknowledged, sir. On my way.

Captain's log, stardate 47615.2. We have

encountered a rogue comet in sector one one five six. It is not native

to this region of space, and there is no previous record of this object

on any Federation charts.

[Bridge]

DATA: Based on its present trajectory, the comet

appears to have originated in the D'Arsay system.

RIKER: That's over two sectors away.

DATA: That is correct, sir. This object has been en route for eighty

seven million years.

RIKER: That's a long time alone in the dark.

PICARD: Begin a full sensor analysis, Mister Data, and log the findings

with the Federation Astrophysical Survey.

DATA: Aye, sir. The comet's outer shell is composed primarily of

gaseous hydrogen and helium surrounding an icy mantle. The inner core

consists of heavier elements

(a bright light sweeps the Bridge)

PICARD: What was that?

DATA: There is distortion within the comet's inner core. I believed we

experienced an intense sensor echo.

RIKER: Can you correct for it?

DATA: I am attempting to do so now, sir. I have compensated for the

effect. Sensors are reconfigured for a low intensity sweep. We are

still picking up some interference, but the distortion is manageable.

At these settings, the scan will be complete in thirty nine hours.

[Troi's quarters]

CRUSHER: Worf says he's going to teach us some

mok'bara throwing techniques today.

TROI: More like falling techniques. Last time we did that I was sore

for a week.

CRUSHER: What's this?

(a three segment column with a rounded stone on top)

TROI: I have no idea. I've never seen it before.

CRUSHER: Maybe Will left it for you. A little present?

TROI: It's not quite his style.

CRUSHER: Then maybe it's a secret admirer.

TROI: That's an interesting thought

CRUSHER: Well, you'll figure it out later. Come on, we're going to be

late.

(Troi and Crusher leave, and a compass rose appears on the top stone)

[Classroom]

TROI: (to a child) That's nice. Data, this is

amazing. How did you come up with this?

(Data has made a half-face mask with a compass rose motif on the

forehead)

DATA: I followed your advice, Counsellor. I used my imagination.

TROI: That's an understatement.

DATA: For some reason, as I was shaping the clay, the image of the mask

was exceptionally clear in my mind. The design seemed to flow quite

naturally.

TROI: Data, have you been in my quarters?

DATA: No, Counsellor.

TROI: Somebody left an object in my room. Some kind of artefact, and it

has something very similar to this. And you don't know anything about

it?

DATA: I do not.

ERIC: Excuse me, Counsellor. Can you help me with my terminal? It's not

working right.

(the screen shows the mask and alien glyphs)

DATA: Perhaps we should investigate this matter further.

[Engineering]

RIKER: These symbols don't match anything in the

Federation linguistic banks.

LAFORGE: Some kind of alien information has been downloaded into our

computer core. I don't know how it's working, but it's reconfiguring

our systems.

RIKER: How did it get in?

LAFORGE: I was able to trace its path from the replicators to the

sensor array.

RIKER: The sensors? They've been scanning that comet for the past

eighteen hours.

LAFORGE: Those energy readings from the comet's core, that sensor echo.

We still don't know what's inside that thing.

RIKER: Maybe it's about time we found out. Could we use the phasers to

melt down the shell of the comet?

LAFORGE: Yeah, a dispersed wide-field beam might do the trick. It

wouldn't take long to come up with the firing parameters. What do you

think, Data?

(Data is still staring at the screen)

LAFORGE: Data? What's wrong?

DATA: I believe I recognise these symbols.

RIKER: How?

DATA: I do not know.

LAFORGE: Do you think maybe your systems have been affected?

DATA: It is a possibility. I do not believe my systems are currently

impaired, but I will run a full diagnostic to make certain.

RIKER: What do you think they mean?

DATA: Boundary. Border. Road. Companion. Message. Messenger.

(a golden sun-face fills the screen)

LAFORGE: What's that one?

DATA: Death.

[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, phasers are set for wide dispersal,

ten percent maximum power. The beam will automatically terminate once

the comet's core is reached.

PICARD: Very well, Mister Worf. Fire.

WORF: Phasers have terminated.

(and now we see a curiously elegant alien construction, several times

the size of the Enterprise)

PICARD: Mister Data, what are we looking at? Is it a ship?

DATA: I do not know, sir. The object is nearly solid. It is composed

primarily of fortanium and several unknown materials. It is over eighty

seven million years old.

RIKER: That's older than the comet itself. Could someone from the

D'Arsay system have built it?

PICARD: There are no technologically advanced cultures in that system

now. But perhaps eighty seven million years ago, there were.

RIKER: Why would they want to hide something like that inside a comet?

PICARD: Possibly it accumulated those frozen gasses over time as it

travelled through space.

LAFORGE: In any case, it's definitely responsible for the system

anomalies we've been experiencing. They're using our sensor beam as a

carrier wave to transmit information into our computers and

replicators.

PICARD: But the question remains, why? What is its purpose?

DATA: Captain, I believe this object is an informational archive.

PICARD: Why do you say that, Mister Data?

DATA: I do not know. However, I seem to have an intuitive understanding

of its function.

LAFORGE: Data, the internal structure of that thing is pretty complex,

and it's got a repetitive node configuration which might suggest a

database of some kind, but it could be practically anything. I don't

see how you could know for sure what it is.

PICARD: Data, do you believe that you're in communication with that

object?

DATA: It is a possibility, sir. I recommend we run a level one

diagnostic of my positronic net immediately to determine if that is the

case.

PICARD: Very well. Mister LaForge, give him a hand.

LAFORGE: Aye, sir.

RIKER: Do you think it's just trying to make contact with us?

PICARD: Yes, it's possible. But if that is an archive from some ancient

civilisation, we should allow it to do so. But we must be careful.

Mister Worf, will you keep an eye on the sensors. If the ship is in any

danger, I want you to sever the connection immediately.

WORF: Aye, sir.

[Ready room]

(there is a collection of new artefacts on Picard's

desk)

PICARD: Come.

RIKER: Captain?

PICARD: Yes, come in, Number One.

RIKER: We've confined the system corruption. It won't be spreading any

further. But we still have alien symbols floating around on our

computer. This is quite a collection you've assembled. I've seen these

things all over the ship. They all look the same. Primitive and

non-functional.

PICARD: Ceremonial, and deceptively primitive. Only an advanced

technological society could have built that object out there. These

artefacts played a ritualistic role in that society, I think.

RIKER: Do you think Data could be right? Could we have stumbled across

some sort of alien library?

PICARD: Oh, yes, it's possible. And if so, this is a find of most

enormous significance. That library seems designed to do so much more

than simply store information. Who knows what we might learn from this?

RIKER: I keep seeing this design.

PICARD: Yes, this symbol seems to be of particular significance.

RIKER: What do you think it means?

PICARD: The concept of the four cardinal compass directions is quite

common in many different cultures.

RIKER: The words that Data recognised in the computer, boundary,

border, road, they were all arranged in this design.

PICARD: Well, perhaps the artefacts that all have this compass symbol

belong to the same theme, movement. Finding a direction, travelling a

path, crossing a boundary.

RIKER: And death? One of the symbols was death.

PICARD: The ultimate boundary.

PICARD: I've seen this symbol everywhere too, but much less prominently

displayed. It's always in the background, smaller than the others.

(a straight line with a hemisphere below it showing a semicircle with

radiant lines - half a sun? )

RIKER: What do you think it represents?

PICARD: I have no idea.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Lower synaptic functions are completely

normal. Autonomous systems all check out.

DATA: I suggest we examine the memory subsystem next.

LAFORGE: All right. (Data twitches) Data, what's wrong?

DATA: I am not certain. I am experiencing a curious sensation.

LAFORGE: Well, what is it?

DATA: An impulse.

LAFORGE: Impulse? What kind of impulse?

DATA: I do not know.

LAFORGE: I'm going to check out your higher functions.

DATA: Geordi, what does it feel like when a person is losing his mind?

LAFORGE: Data, come on, you're scaring me now. What's going on?

DATA: I do not know. I am different.

LAFORGE: Well, you're going to be all right. You're with me, okay?

DATA: Okay.

LAFORGE: Listen, I'm going to disconnect you. (does so) What's going

on?

(Data's circuitry has changed)

LAFORGE: Data.

(Data has the compass symbol on his forehead and a wicked grin)

DATA-IHAT: Masaka is waking.

(after the break, Data is sitting on the warp core as Picard enters.

There is a symbol on his chest.)

LAFORGE: Captain

DATA-IHAT: Captain. I've been waiting for you. You should feel

honoured. I don't usually wait for anyone.

PICARD: What is it you want?

DATA-IHAT: Masaka is waking.

PICARD: Are you Masaka?

DATA-IHAT: I am not Masaka. I am Ihat.

PICARD: What have you done to Commander Data?

DATA-IHAT: Commander Data? You mean the one who was here?

PICARD: Yes.

DATA-IHAT: He's gone. Who can say where?

PICARD: Picard to Counsellor Troi. Report to main Engineering

immediately.

DATA-IHAT: Picard to Counsellor Troi. Report to main Engineering

immediately.

PICARD: Ihat, this place you come from, is it a cultural archive of

your species?

DATA-IHAT: I come from Masaka's city.

PICARD: Are there others like you there?

(Data goes to lie on the 'pool table')

DATA-IHAT: There are no others like me.

PICARD: Who is Masaka?

DATA-IHAT: You will find out.

PICARD: I would like to know Masaka, speak with her.

DATA-IHAT: Do you understand pain? Death? That is all you need to know

of Masaka. It is what she is. Go. Leave this place before she finds

you. It can be done. I did it.

(Troi enters)

DATA-IHAT: Masaka.

(Data kneels before her in fear, and when he looks up again, there is a

different symbol on his chest)

DATA-VICTIM: I am yours. Every part of me is yours.

PICARD: We should confine him to quarters.

[Observation lounge]

(Pos net micrograph 289.25 on the wall monitor)

LAFORGE: This is a micrograph of what's happened to Data's positronic

net. Now, as near as I can tell, these are behavioural nodes. I've

counted fourteen so far. I think the archive is using Data to create

different people within its culture much in the same way it used our

replicators to create artefacts.

TROI: As a result, Data's real personality has been completely buried.

In a sense, Data has the android equivalent of multiple personalities.

LAFORGE: The archive hasn't stopped yet. Data's positronic net is still

being transformed. There's no telling how many more personalities might

emerge.

PICARD: Geordi, I want you to continue to scan the archive. See if you

can find some way to access it. And in the meantime, I'll see what I

can learn from these people inside Data.

[Data's quarters]

PICARD: I'm not going to hurt you.

DATA-VICTIM: Only Masaka can hurt me. I am for her alone.

PICARD: I need to speak with Ihat. Do you understand? Ihat.

DATA-IHAT: Captain. That was a cruel joke you played on me. For a

moment, a brief moment, I actually thought that woman was Masaka.

PICARD: Whoever took your place wasn't afraid of Masaka. He seemed

eager for his fate.

DATA-IHAT: Pitiful, isn't it. You won't catch me humiliating myself for

a woman even if she were a queen.

PICARD: Then Masaka is your queen?

DATA-IHAT: She's a lazy creature. She spends most of her time sleeping.

The problem is, what she does when she's awake.

PICARD: Then should we try to keep her asleep?

DATA-IHAT: Try to stop the sun from climbing the sky? Only Korgano can

do that, and he's not here.

PICARD: Where is he?

DATA-BOY: Help me. Please.

PICARD: What's wrong?

DATA-BOY: I'm afraid.

PICARD: Of what?

DATA-BOY: Of her.

PICARD: Masaka?

DATA-BOY: Her!

(the lights go out)

PICARD: Picard to Bridge.

[Bridge]

PICARD [OC]: Report.

RIKER: The archive just activated some kind of tractor beam, sir. We're

not able to disengage it.

[Data's quarters]]

PICARD: Has there been any damage to the ship?

[Bridge]

RIKER: There was an emergency reported in Ten

Forward. Mister Worf's on his way.

LAFORGE: Captain, there's some kind of energy pulse coming through the

tractor beam.

[Data's quarters]

LAFORGE [OC]: It's overriding our control systems.

PICARD: I'll be right there.

DATA-BOY: (gripping Picard's wrist) Don't leave me.

PICARD: I won't leave you. Please, let go of me.

DATA-BOY: Does it hurt?

PICARD: Yes.

DATA-BOY: She's going to hurt us all.

(he lets go)

DATA-IHAT: Now you've done it, Captain. Masaka is awake.

[Ten Forward]

(it now contains tropical foliage and stone, and a

large version of Troi's ornament with a sun image on it. Think lost

Mayan ruins.)

TROI: Who's this?

PICARD: I'd say that that is Masaka. Ihat referred to her as a queen,

and it's not unusual in ceremonial cultures to find royalty symbolised

by a sun.

TROI: You said the personalities inside Data were in awe of her, even

terrified.

PICARD: According to Data, the sun image is also a symbol for death.

(on the reverse of the obelisk)

PICARD: There it is again. The same U-shaped symbol, small and

insignificant. Almost as if it's an afterthought.

LAFORGE: Captain, this is incredible. These artefacts weren't beamed

over here from the archive. The matter here in Ten Forward has been

transformed.

PICARD: Into living plants? How is that possible?

LAFORGE: I'm not sure. But bit by bit, this ship is being transformed.

WORF: We have been receiving reports from the rest of the ship. Part of

deck twelve is now an aqueduct.

TROI: What are we being transformed into?

LAFORGE: I'm not sure I want to find out.

PICARD: I don't think we have a choice. We must destroy that archive.

Mister Worf?

WORF: Sir, our weapon control systems are inoperative. However, we

could reconfigure a photon torpedo for manual launch.

PICARD: Make it so.

(Worf and La Forge leave)

PICARD: There's so much here we could have learned. I really regret

losing that opportunity.

[Engineering]

(a torpedo lies on the floor)

LAFORGE: Okay, I've locked in the targeting parameters. What's the

phase alignment now?

WORF: Less than point seven percent.

LAFORGE: Good, that'll do it. I'm setting the yield at maximum.

(and the torpedo lights go out)

WORF: Sir, the onboard power systems are not functioning.

LAFORGE: Let's see what's going on here?

(the torpedo is full of snakes, Masaka is on the wall monitor and there

are vines)

LAFORGE: Something tells me we'd better get out of here.

(flames stop them)

WORF: Engineering to Bridge. Emergency transport. Two to beam out.

[Bridge]

(it's dark and there are vines and stones here too)

RIKER: Maybe we'd better talk in here. The Observation Lounge has

turned into a swamp.

PICARD: So, what's our status?

LAFORGE: Well, so far the archive has transformed about twenty percent

of the ship. We've lost main propulsion and weapons systems in the

process.

RIKER: What about communications, sensors, life support?

LAFORGE: We have communications, and limited sensor control. Life

support seems to be unaffected.

CRUSHER: I've analysed the alien plant forms. They've developed from

biological matter we have on the ship.

LAFORGE: The stone, the artefacts, are made in much the same way,

extrapolating from the ship's own alloys.

CRUSHER: Apparently the archive can reorder and transform molecular

structure including DNA into anything it wants.

PICARD: So it's using our ship, our alloys, our DNA, to create elements

of its own culture.

TROI: But why is this happening? What does the archive hope to

accomplish?

PICARD: Well, whatever the intent that lies behind its process, I'm not

going to permit this ship to be turned into an alien city. Mister La

Forge, do you have any ideas?

LAFORGE: We still haven't been able to cut off that beam, but I have

managed to access the archive by sending an energy pulse back along

their signal path. If I can locate the transformation programme, I

might be able to control it.

PICARD: That's a good idea, but I feel that the answer lies there, with

Masaka. We must find her, access her. Talk to her.

[Data's quarters]

(a dirt floor and a raised hearth in the middle)

PICARD: Hello.

DATA-ELDER: Difficult to stay warm. It's not warm enough, not for an

old man.

PICARD: Tell me about Masaka.

DATA-ELDER: My daughter.

PICARD: Tell me, how can I talk to her?

DATA-ELDER: Children grow, forget their parents. Only Korgano can talk

to Masaka.

PICARD: Korgano? Who is that?

(the fire flares)

DATA-IHAT: Well, aren't we the persistent one.

PICARD: Ihat.

DATA-IHAT: Is anyone else so charming?

PICARD: Masaka is taking over my ship.

DATA-IHAT: I told you she would.

PICARD: I want to talk with her but I understand that Korgano is the

only one who can do that.

DATA-IHAT: Who told you that?

PICARD: An old man. Masaka's father.

DATA-IHAT: Oh, yes, yes. Legend has it she chopped him up and used his

bones to make the world. Any wonder he doesn't like to talk about her?

PICARD: How can I find Korgano?

DATA-IHAT: I don't know. He's not chasing her anymore.

PICARD: Where has he gone?

DATA-IHAT: Stop asking me these questions. I was fast enough to get

away from her once. I don't want her to find me again. I'll wind up on

her sacrificial slab.

PICARD: Ihat, if she's looking for a sacrifice, she can take me.

Perhaps then she'll stop looking for you.

DATA-IHAT: Well, there's an idea. Better you than me.

PICARD: Very well. What do we do.

DATA-IHAT: You must build Masaka's temple. The Queen's temple. That

will get her attention.

PICARD: Very well. How do I do that?

DATA-IHAT: You need the sign. I could give it to you. So could the old

man. But just try getting it out of him.

PICARD: Give me the sign.

DATA-IHAT: If she finds out, you can't imagine her rage. She lets

people die of thirst. A terrible death. Sometimes she burns them alive.

She is glorious.

PICARD: Ihat, the sign, give it to me.

DATA-IHAT: If she comes, you will take my place?

PICARD: Yes.

DATA-IHAT: All right. Quickly, give me your hand. A line, as the

unending horizon. A curve as. She has found me.

PICARD: Masaka, show yourself. I will go with you.

DATA-IHAT: It seems I was not fast enough.

DATA-ELDER: So hard to stay warm. Are you one of my children? I can't

remember anymore.

PICARD: I need your help. I need the sign for the temple. For Masaka's

temple.

DATA-ELDER: It won't help you. Korgano no longer pursues her. Only he

can stop her.

(Picard takes the old man's hand and draws in the dirt)

PICARD: A line as the unending horizon. A curve as? A line as the

unending horizon. A curve

DATA-ELDER: As the rolling hillside. A point as a distant bird. A ray

as the rising sun.

PICARD: Thank you.

DATA-ELDER: Now, come sit with me. Tend the fire.

DATA-BOY: I'm alone. No one left to help me. She's coming.

PICARD: Are all the others dead? Did Masaka kill them?

DATA-BOY: No. She sent them away. It will take them days to die.

(Data no longer has the symbols on him)

[Bridge]

(there's nowhere to sit now)

PICARD: Any progress, Mister La Forge?

LAFORGE: I think I've found the archive's transformation programme.

PICARD: Will it accept the symbol for Masaka's temple?

LAFORGE: I think so. I've isolated the program's input pathways.

They're keyed to accept symbols. If I input this one, it should

initiate the transformation process.

RIKER: And create the temple?

LAFORGE: I hope so. If this is the wrong symbol, it might turn the

Enterprise into a big chunk of rock. No way to know for sure.

TROI: The question is, can we trust a personality from an alien archive

that seems bent on taking us over?

PICARD: Ihat risked his life to show me that symbol, and Masaka killed

him for doing it. I think we have to risk it.

[Corridor]

WORF: Captain. The entire deck has been cleared of

personnel. We may proceed.

PICARD: Commander Riker, we're ready.

RIKER [OC]: Understood.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Initiate transformation.

LAFORGE: Inputting the symbol now.

[Corridor]

(and it changes into)

[Temple]

PICARD: This would seem that this is Masaka's

temple.

WORF: There is no one else here.

(Troi scans the Maya-esque structure)

PICARD: Ihat said that if we created the temple, then it would get her

attention. It may be some time before she shows herself.

(Troi goes up the steps to the throne)

WORF: How will she do that?

PICARD: I don't know.

TROI: Captain, take a look at this.

PICARD: This is the first time I've seen these two symbols paired. That

could be significant. Look, there it is again, and again. And there

again. This is obviously an important pairing. He isn't chasing her

anymore.

TROI: Sir?

PICARD: Ihat said that someone named Korgano isn't chasing Masaka

anymore. And the old man said, he pursues her no longer. In a sense,

this small symbol might be seen to be chasing Masaka.

WORF: The symbol suggests antlers of some kind. Horns. Maybe it is

meant to represent an animal.

TROI: Animals are worshipped in many cultures.

PICARD: That smaller symbol could represent Korgano. Both Ihat and the

old man said that Korgano was the only one who could control Masaka.

Many ritualistic cultures incorporate the idea of balance into their

belief systems. Now, Masaka is a queen. A powerful, god-like figure.

It's not unrealistic to believe that she might have a counterpart, a

consort. Look around. See if you can find that horn-like symbol

anywhere else.

[Data's quarters]]

(Data wakes and puts on his version of Masaka's

mask)

[Corridor]

(Data knocks out the guards)

[Temple]

TROI: This is the most prominent instance of the

horn symbol we've seen yet.

WORF: But now it appears as though Masaka's sun is chasing it.

TROI: The sun chasing an animal?

PICARD: Maybe it's simpler than that. Maybe their relationship is more

like the sun and the moon.

WORF: I see. Masaka and Korgano switching positions. The sun setting

and the moon rising.

PICARD: Exactly. Like two powerful rulers changing places in a

continuous cycle.

TROI: And like the sun and the moon, only one of them can be in

ascendance at any given time.

PICARD: If we can find Korgano in the archive and bring him out, then

perhaps he could force Masaka to leave.

WORF: But would we be any better off with him?

PICARD: Ihat and the others didn't seem to be frightened of Korgano.

(the room shake)

TROI: Sir.

PICARD: Masaka.

(Data sits on the throne)

PICARD: Masaka, I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship

DATA-MASAKA: Go away.

PICARD: Please, hear us. Your archive is destroying

DATA-MASAKA: I do not hear you.

WORF: She will not even listen to us.

PICARD: Then we will have to find someone too whom she will listen.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: I've found it, Captain. This is the only

place in the archive where Korgano's moon symbol appears by itself, not

linked with Masaka's.

PICARD: All right, Mister La Forge, I want you to access the

transformation programme. And when you're ready, input the symbol.

RIKER: Isn't that a little risky?

TROI: We have no way idea what the result would be. The symbol might

generate anything from Korgano's temple to Korgano himself.

PICARD: In one sense, Korgano is Masaka's nemesis. Whatever this symbol

represents, it could be for us a means to control her. Now, if anyone

has a better idea, I'd be happy to entertain it.

LAFORGE: I've accessed the programme, Captain.

PICARD: Initiate the transformation.

(a mask appears)

RIKER: Another mask.

PICARD: You know, we could be going about this all the wrong way. This

is a very ritualistic culture based on symbol and myth. Perhaps we

should try to confront them on those terms. If I could somehow

incorporate myself in their ritual, then perhaps Masaka would listen to

me.

RIKER: You're going to try to pose as Korgano?

TROI: Captain, we know so little about this culture and even less about

Korgano. How would you convince Masaka that you're him?

PICARD: I'm really not certain, but there are similarities between this

culture and others that I've studied. I would imagine I'm just going to

improvise. Mister Worf, what's our status?

WORF: I estimate we have less than two hours before there is nothing

left of the ship. At least, nothing we can recognise.

[Temple]

PICARD: Masaka.

(Picard takes his place to the left of the main throne)

DATA-MASAKA: Korgano.

PICARD: Are you surprised to see me?

DATA-MASAKA: I thought I had escaped you.

PICARD: You should know that is impossible.

DATA-MASAKA: You are a fine hunter but I am a powerful prey. You will

never catch me.

PICARD: Do you want to be the prey forever?

DATA-MASAKA: I thought I was alone. I thought I would not have to share

the sky with you.

PICARD: But without me you are not complete. I know you so well. You

live for the chase, as do I. Will you not miss being the hunter,

pursuing me, forcing me from the sky so that you can rise again?

DATA-MASAKA: You know me well, Korgano.

PICARD: I think that you are beginning to tire. It is difficult,

brightening the sky forever.

DATA-MASAKA: I am getting sleepy. You always do that to me.

PICARD: So that you can wake with the dawn and begin the hunt again.

DATA-MASAKA: Let the hunt begin again. I am eager for that.

(Data falls asleep)

PICARD: As am I.

(and Picard mask glows and vanishes, then temple reverts to)

[Corridor]

RIKER [OC]: Riker to Picard. I don't know what you

did, sir, but it looks like everything's back to normal.

PICARD: Acknowledged, Number One. Mister Data, are you all right?

DATA: I believe so, sir. I am not entirely certain what has happened.

Have I been dreaming again?

PICARD: I'm afraid that will take some time to explain.

Captain's log, stardate 47618.4. Commander La Forge

has managed to disable the alien transformation

programme. Starfleet has

dispatched an archaeological team to study the archive further.

[Ready room]

(Picard is holding Masaka's mask)

PICARD: But I don't understand. I thought all the alien artefacts had

disappeared from the Enterprise.

DATA: That one was not created by the archive, sir. That is the clay

mask I originally made. I have since painted it.

PICARD: A memento.

DATA: Yes, sir. Although I am relieved to be rid of those alien

personalities, in a sense, I am now empty.

PICARD: I can imagine. Doctor Crusher told me that there were possibly

dozens of personalities inside you.

DATA: I suspect the number was much greater. My impression is that

there were thousands, of all ages and walks of life. It was a

remarkable experience.

PICARD: Well, Data, you never may become fully human, but you've had an

experience that transcends the human condition. You have been an entire

civilisation.

Stardate:

47622.1

Original Airdate: 28 Feb, 1994

  [Bridge]

DATA: We are losing containment in the starboard

nacelle tube.

PICARD: Try to get more power to the field coils.

DATA: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Mister La Forge.

[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Report.

LAFORGE: I can't shut down the plasma injectors. Somebody's locked out

the controls.

[Bridge]

DATA: The plasma venting system has engaged.

[Jefferies tube]

(climbing ladders)

WORF: Two more decks.

RIKER: Riker to Bridge. We've almost reached the nacelle tube.

PICARD [OC]: Acknowledged.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Release the exterior hull plate. We may

have to jettison the core.

DATA: Aye, sir.

[Nacelle control]

(there is a man poised to jump into the plasma)

RIKER: What happened?

NARA: (alien woman) He locked out the controls. Before we knew what was

happening, he stepped up onto the walkway.

RIKER: (to Worf) See if you can help shut down the plasma flow.

NARA: I'm afraid if we try to get any closer, he will jump through the

forcefield.

RIKER: Dan, it's me. It's Will Riker. I was here yesterday, remember?

KWAN: (alien man) I didn't want to do it. But I saw them. And they

laughed at me. They laughed.

(Riker is on the walkway)

RIKER: Whatever happened, we can talk about it. I want to help.

KWAN: Stay away!

RIKER: I just want to see your face, that's all. So we can talk.

KWAN: I know what I have to do.

RIKER: Dan, no!

WORF: I have unlocked the controls.

COMPUTER: Shutdown procedure initiated.

NARA: There's still plasma in the injector. It'll take time to vent

off.

RIKER: Tell me what happened. Maybe I can help.

KWAN: I know what I have to do.

(and he jumps into the plasma stream. Riker hits the bulkhead in anger

and frustration and despair)

[Ready room]

RIKER: A few more seconds I could've saved his life

WORF: Commander, you did everything you could. It was not your fault.

RIKER: It was strange. I felt as if he didn't even recognise me,

although I was with him just the other day when I supervised the tube

refit.

PICARD: How did he seem then?

RIKER: Fine. I complimented him on getting the refit done faster than

expected. He was pleased that I'd noticed.

TROI: I met with him about six weeks ago, during the crew evaluations.

He was very positive. He was looking forward to being posted to the

nacelle tube.

RIKER: He was a good officer with a fine career ahead of him. I don't

understand why he wanted

PICARD: In my years as a Starship Captain, I've had to notify many

parents of the loss of loved ones, but never before a suicide. I would

like to be able to offer Lieutenant Kwan's parents some explanation of

what happened, to try to help them make sense of this.

WORF: Maybe he left a message of some kind, explaining why he did it.

PICARD: I would like the two of you to piece together a picture of his

last few days.

TROI: If he made any personal logs, it might be helpful to look through

them.

PICARD: You're authorised to do so.

(Troi and Worf leave)

LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Captain.

PICARD: Go ahead.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I've just finished my damage assessment.

We should be able to get underway I'd say within the hour.

PICARD [OC]: Mister La Forge

[Ready room]

PICARD: The medical situation on Barson Two has

worsened. Starfleet has given us permission to exceed warp speed

limitations so as to get back on schedule.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We'll be able to give you warp eight if

you need it.

PICARD [OC]: Acknowledged.

DATA: Geordi, would you agree that the instinct for self-preservation

is shared by most life forms?

LAFORGE: I'd say it's probably the most basic instinct, Data.

DATA: That being the case, I find it difficult to understand why

someone would deliberately terminate their own existence.

LAFORGE: I don't know, Data. All I can think is that maybe Lieutenant

Kwan felt that there was something wrong in his life, something he felt

powerless to fix.

DATA: I believe I understand. I have been in a similar situation.

LAFORGE: Really?

DATA: The first months following my activation were a difficult period

for me. There were many problems associated with my becoming sentient.

LAFORGE: Because your neural net was still forming.

DATA: As I acquired new skills, neural pathways would form replacing

other less complex pathways. It was very disorienting.

LAFORGE: I bet.

DATA: As my systems grew in complexity, it became increasingly

difficult to integrate new pathways into my existing neural net. The

probability of cascade failure grew with each additional pathway. I

came to the conclusion it would be safer and easier to shut myself down

and start again.

LAFORGE: Yeah, but if you had done that, you wouldn't have remembered

any of the things that had happened to you.

DATA: In a way, it would have been like committing suicide.

LAFORGE: So what did you do?

DATA: I decided against the procedure. I chose instead to treat the

problems I was having with my systems as challenges to overcome, rather

than obstacles to be avoided.

LAFORGE: Great way of looking at it, Data. I wish Lieutenant Kwan had

been able to look at his problems the same way.

[Kwan's quarters]

WORF: This is a Napean design.

TROI: His mother's Napean, his father's human. It all looks so normal.

For some reason I half expected the place to be a mess.

WORF: Yes. It is strange to think that someone could have considered

ending his life and yet give no outward sign. Just before he jumped, he

seemed almost calm.

TROI: Well, he must have been in a lot of pain to do what he did. It

could be that the prospect of ending the pain felt like a great relief.

(Troi picks up a photograph on the bedside table)

TROI: This is Ensign Calloway, isn't it?

WORF: Yes, she is a medical technician in Sickbay.

TROI: It's always hard to lose someone you care about, but to lose them

like this?

WORF: We should check his personal logs.

TROI: This is his last entry. He made it before going on duty this

morning.

KWAN [on monitor]: Personal log, stardate 47622.1. We finally finished

the nacelle tube refit last night. After pulling two double shifts in a

row, I'm really looking forward to spending some time with Maddy.

TROI: Ensign Calloway. That doesn't sound like a man who's planning on

taking his own life.

WORF: No. No, it does not.

[Crusher's office]

CALLOWAY: I can't believe he's really gone. I keep

thinking he's going to show up and tell me there's been some kind of

terrible misunderstanding.

TROI: I thought you might like to know that in his personal logs, Dan

talked about you a great deal. He loved you very much.

CALLOWAY: If that's true, then how could he leave me like this?

TROI: That's what I'm trying to find out. I know it's hard to talk

right now, but it would be very helpful if you could tell me a few

things about him. When was the last time you saw him?

CALLOWAY: Two nights ago. We were planning our next shore leave

together.

TROI: Did he mention anything that had happened recently, anything that

might have upset him?

CALLOWAY: No, not really. He did say something about work, about

Lieutenant Nara, but it wasn't anything serious.

TROI: Nara. She's his superior officer in the nacelle tube?

CALLOWAY: Yes. Dan sensed that she, well, that she felt threatened by

him. That she thought he was after her position.

TROI: Was he prone to mood swings or depression?

CALLOWAY: No, but he was very sensitive to other people's moods. He

used to look at me and know exactly what I was feeling. I always loved

that about him.

TROI: Well, Napeans are partially empathic. He may have inherited some

of his mother's abilities.

CALLOWAY: He used to tease me that when I met her, I wouldn't be able

to get away with anything. Dan and I knew each other for over two

years, but we didn't get together until a few months ago. We took it

slow. We thought we had all the time in the world. Something must have

happened to him, Counsellor. Something terrible, because it's not like

Dan to take his own life.

TROI: I understand.

CALLOWAY: Please, find out what it was.

[Nacelle control]

NARA: Can I help you?

TROI: Oh, I didn't see you there. You're Lieutenant Nara, aren't you?

NARA: Can I do something for you, Counsellor?

TROI: I'm investigating Lieutenant Kwan's death, and I just wanted to

look around.

NARA: It's such a shame. He was a good man.

TROI: Did you notice any change in his behaviour recently?

NARA: No. I've been going over the last few days in my mind, trying to

see if I, if I missed any warning signs. It's as if something in him

just snapped.

TROI: How was his job performance?

NARA: Excellent. He knew this ship better than most people, probably

because he helped build it back at Utopia Planitia.

TROI: Did he get along with his coworkers?

NARA: He was ambitious. He came in here with all sorts of new ideas

about how to do things. Some of them very good ideas.

TROI: But not all?

NARA: No. But after he settled in, we got along fine.

(a crewman enters)

NARA: Excuse me a minute. Feel free to look around.

TROI: Where was Lieutenant Kwan's station?

NARA: Right there.

(Nara leaves with the crewman. Troi goes up the ladder to the walkway

and gets a sense of terror by the hatch. She hurries back down again.)

NARA: Are you all right?

TROI: I don't know.

[Sickbay]

TROI: I don't know how to describe it. I was

suddenly overwhelmed by a flood of emotions. Fear, rage, panic. And the

sensations didn't seem to be coming from any person. They were just

there, in the room.

RIKER: Whose emotions were they? I thought you said were alone.

TROI: I was.

WORF: I scanned the area. I found no anomalous readings.

RIKER: How could you get an empathic impression from an empty room?

TROI: I don't know.

CRUSHER: Could the fact that Lieutenant Kwan was partially empathic

have anything to do with it?

RIKER: What do you mean?

CRUSHER: I'm not sure, but certainly the feelings Troi described are

consistent with suicide.

RIKER: Could his death have left some sort of empathic echo?

TROI: I don't see how. But if I went back to the nacelle tube, I might

get a better sense of what I experienced.

CRUSHER: I don't think I'd recommend that right now. You're showing

elevated levels of psilosynine.

WORF: Psilosynine?

CRUSHER: It's a neurotransmitter involved in telepathy. The experience

overwhelmed you the first time. I think you should wait until your

levels return to normal.

RIKER: How long?

CRUSHER: Three, maybe four hours.

RIKER: This time I want someone with you.

WORF: I shall accompany you, Counsellor.

Captain's log, stardate 47623.2. We've arrived at

Starbase three twenty eight on schedule. After taking aboard medical

supplies, we will depart for Barson Two.

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Come in. Hello, Worf.

WORF: Counsellor. Have you found anything in Lieutenant Kwan's logs?

TROI: Everything I've read suggests that he was well-adjusted and

optimistic. It just doesn't make any sense. Can I get you anything?

WORF: No. No, nothing.

TROI: Yridian tea. I've been thinking about what happened to me in the

nacelle tube. Whether it was an empathic echo left by Kwan's death.

WORF: In the past, have your empathic experiences always involved the

physical presence of another person?

TROI: All the ones I'm sure of, yes.

WORF: What do you mean, sure of?

TROI: Well, when I was a young girl, my grandfather used to tell me

stories by the fire. I would close my eyes and listen to his mind for

hours on end.

WORF: He would tell you these stories telepathically?

TROI: My grandfather rarely spoke. He said that was for off-worlders

and people who didn't know any better. Now the only time I can remember

his stories is when I go home and sit by the fireplace. Sometimes when

I'm alone there, it's almost as if I can hear his voice inside my head.

WORF: Yes. Yes, I too have sought visions in fire.

TROI: I can't explain it, but it feels real to me. Just like what

happened in the nacelle tube.

WORF: There are things we do not understand, yet they exist

nonetheless. Perhaps I should let you get some rest.

TROI: Oh, it's all right.

WORF: If you will excuse me, Counsellor.

[Ten Forward]

(Riker is in casual clothes with a woman. He comes

to the bar where Worf is standing)

RIKER: Mister Worf.

WORF: Commander.

RIKER: Two Til'amin froths, please.

BARMAN: Yes, sir.

WORF: Lieutenant Corell seems to be enjoying your company.

RIKER: I'd like to think so.

WORF: Are you involved with her?

RIKER: I'm not sure yet. Why, are you interested?

WORF: No. But if I were, I would of course discuss the situation with

you before proceeding further.

RIKER: I appreciate it, but that really wouldn't be necessary.

WORF: I mean I would never want to come between you and someone you are

involved with, or had ever been involved with.

RIKER: Is there someone in particular that you're talking about?

WORF: No. Is there someone in particular you would rather I not be

involved with?

RIKER: Mister Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he

can start dating his sister.

WORF: No, no, I was merely. Never mind. Excuse me, sir.

[Nacelle control]

(Troi goes up to the hatch again)

TROI: Could you open this door for me?

WORF: Yes, but only for a short time. After ninety seconds the plasma

venting system will engage to prevent degradation of the forcefield.

TROI: I just want to take a quick look.

WORF: May I ask what you're looking for?

TROI: I'm not sure.

(the hatch rises and the stream of energy is visible)

COMPUTER: Warning plasma venting system will engage in ninety seconds.

WOMAN: No! No, no, please. Please, please. No! Don't! No!

COMPUTER: Warning. Plasma venting system will engage in eighty seconds.

(a man is staring at her)

TROI: Worf?

(a toolbox is present labelled Utopia Planetia - and the nacelle is not

completed)

TROI: Worf?

(Troi goes back down the ladder and hears laughter from the junction

room. She opens the door to see another man and the woman kissing. They

laugh at her)

WORF: Counsellor, are you all right?

(the room is back as it should be)

TROI: Let's get out of here.

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: Do you remember anything else?

TROI: Yes, I think I do. There was a tool crate on the floor. It was

labeled Utopia Planitia.

DATA: The shipyard where the Enterprise was built.

PICARD: Clearly this was much more than an empathic echo. It seems that

you were actually seeing something that happened in the control room

eight years ago.

TROI: Everyone was looking directly at me, but it was as though I was

seeing through someone else's eyes.

DATA: Lieutenant Kwan was partially empathic.

CRUSHER: Maybe you were seeing it through his eyes?

TROI: It's possible, but I don't see how it could have happened.

PICARD: Well, putting that on one side for the moment, let's assume

that by some unexplained phenomenon, you witnessed an event that

occurred to Lieutenant Kwan. Those faces that you saw. Did you

recognise any of them?

TROI: I've never seen the woman before, or the man who was with her.

But there was someone else there. A man. He was staring at me in the

most peculiar way. I think he had reddish hair. And he did seem

familiar to me. But it's all so hazy. It's like trying to remember a

dream.

PICARD: There was a woman who was frightened. And then you saw her

again, laughing, presumably at Lieutenant Kwan.

CRUSHER: What does it all mean?

TROI: I don't know, but something terrible happened in there. I felt

it.

PICARD: Counsellor, I want you to look through the personnel files of

Utopia Planitia. See if you can recognise any of those faces.

TROI: If only I could go back to the control room without being

overwhelmed by the experience. It might help me remember some detail

that might be relevant.

CRUSHER: I could give you an inhibitor that would slow the brain's

production of psilosynine. That might be able to suppress your empathic

abilities and make the experience more manageable. It would take about

sixteen hours to synthesise the inhibitor.

TROI: I'd like to try that.

PICARD: Very well, Counsellor.

[Bridge]

(Troi is ploughing through personnel files on the

science station - Guy Vardeman is masquerading as Darien Wallace)

WORF: I apologise for being late. The viral medicines we are

transporting to Barson Two require special security measures to insure

they are properly contained. Have you found anything?

TROI: No. There were literally thousands of people involved in building

the Enterprise.

WORF: Perhaps if you should try to narrow the search parameters.

TROI: I think I have. The man who looked familiar to me may have served

on board the Enterprise in the last seven years, so I've asked the

computer to limit its search to personnel who served at Utopia Planitia

and on the Enterprise.

TROI: Ensign Salvatore. He transferred over a year ago. Lieutenant

Ziff. She's in Quantum mechanics. That's him.

WORF: Lieutenant Walter Pierce.

TROI: I remember now. He came on board about six months ago. I think

he's in Engineering.

[Engineering]

WORF: You were Lieutenant Kwan's supervisor at

Utopia Planitia?

PIERCE: That's right. I was sorry to hear what happened.

TROI: Did you ever spend time in the nacelle control room while it was

under construction?

PIERCE: I worked all over the ship. In fact, I remember running a power

conduit right behind this wall here.

TROI: Were you ever in the nacelle room at the same time as Lieutenant

Kwan?

PIERCE: It was a long time ago. People were working all over the place.

WORF: So you do not remember?

PIERCE: I'm sorry, I don't.

TROI: Do you recall if anything unusual happened there?

PIERCE: How do you mean?

TROI: An altercation, perhaps. Possibly involving Lieutenant Kwan.

PIERCE: No, nothing like that. The way I remember it, things went

pretty smoothly. What's this all about, if you don't mind my asking?

TROI: Not at all. When I was in the nacelle room I had an empathic

experience.

WORF: We believe the Counsellor may have been seeing an event that

occurred eight years ago.

TROI: And I saw you there. Do you have any idea why that might be?

PIERCE: I'm afraid I don't.

TROI: Lieutenant, are you aware that I can sense when someone's telling

the truth?

PIERCE: I've heard that.

TROI: Then I'm sure that if you remember anything that might be

relevant to our investigation, you'll contact me.

PIERCE: Of course.

TROI: Thank you, Lieutenant.

PIERCE: Counsellor.

[Corridor]

TROI: The strange thing is I couldn't read him at

all.

WORF: But you implied that? We have played poker together many times.

I've never known you to bluff.

TROI: Well it wouldn't be much of a bluff if you knew, would it? The

fact that I couldn't read him suggests that he has at least some

telepathic ability.

WORF: But Pierce is human.

TROI: That's what I don't understand. Even though I couldn't read his

emotions, I did feel that he was holding something back.

WORF: I thought so as well.

TROI: Maybe we should try to access the Engineering logs from Utopia

Planitia. We might find out more about him.

WORF: There may be something in them about Lieutenant Kwan as well.

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: It going to take about half an hour for the

transmission to be completed.

WORF: Perhaps we should continue this in the morning.

TROI: It is late.

WORF: Yes, and you must be tired.

TROI: A little.

WORF: So I will say goodnight.

TROI: Goodnight.

WORF: We should get an early start tomorrow.

TROI: I think we should. I'll see you in the morning.

WORF: Yes.

(finally, Worf takes her hand and nuzzles her neck, then they kiss

passionately)

(next morning, Troi is still in bed and Worf is already dressed. He

kisses her awake. I thought non-Klingon females were too fragile??)

TROI: Hello.

WORF: Breakfast is ready.

TROI: That sounds nice. But it can wait. Why didn't we do this a long

time ago?

CRUSHER [OC]: Crusher to Counsellor Troi.

TROI: Yes, Doctor.

[Sickbay]

 CRUSHER: I've synthesised the inhibitor. Please

come to Sickbay whenever you're ready.

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Acknowledged.

CRUSHER [OC]: Crusher to Lieutenant Worf.

WORF: Worf, here.

CRUSHER [OC]: Medical supplies are ready to be taken to cargo bay for

transport.

WORF: I will be there shortly.

[Sickbay]

(Deanna gets her shot)

CRUSHER: This should take effect immediately.

TROI: Will it completely suppress my empathic abilities?

CRUSHER: It's hard to say for sure, but I can always increase the

dosage if it's not enough.

(Worf enters with Calloway)

WORF: The cargo bay will be off limits to all but medical personnel.

CALLOWAY: Thanks for your help, sir.

WORF: You're welcome.

TROI: Good morning.

WORF: Counsellor.

TROI: Data and Geordi are already in the nacelle tube. Are you ready?

WORF: Yes.

CALLOWAY: Excuse me, sir. About the quarantine field in the cargo bay?

It looks like we'll need a second field generator.

WORF: I am needed here. I will join you as soon as I can.

TROI: All right.

WORF: Apparently my help was not so good after all.

CALLOWAY: Yes, it was. You were wonderful.

WORF: I think I know what's wrong.

[Nacelle control]

LAFORGE: Counsellor, you okay?

TROI: I'm fine. The inhibitor seems to be working. Have you found

anything?

LAFORGE: No, nothing unusual.

TROI: I don't remember seeing these during my empathic experience. Have

they been here since the ship was built?

DATA: No, they were installed two years ago.

(Troi goes up the ladder to the nacelle proper)

TROI: Geordi, I remember seeing a plasma conduit right there.

LAFORGE: The main ODN line runs right behind that panel. It lifts out

so you can get to it.

NARA: Kwan was working on that conduit the day before he died.

TROI: Can you open it?

LAFORGE: Sure. It'll take just a minute.

(he goes downstairs.)

LAFORGE: Data.

TROI: Lieutenant Nara, may I ask you something? The work Lieutenant

Kwan was doing, was it unusual in any way?

NARA: He was refitting a field coil, but it was probably the first time

that particular panel's been opened since the ship was built.

TROI: Thank you.

[Injector room]

(Geordi removes the panel)

WOMAN: No!

(Troi sees Pierce in his UP coverall)

LAFORGE: Counsellor, are you all right?

TROI: Something happened when you removed the panel. There's something

in there.

DATA: I am getting readings that indicate organic material embedded in

this wall.

LAFORGE: Organic? You're right. Let me reconfigure the emitter beam. We

might be able to see what it is. There.

(skull, ribcage, spine)

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: This dosage should prevent any further

empathic flashes.

CALLOWAY: The bone fragments are definitely human. I sequenced a DNA

sample. I'll see if I can match it to Starfleet records.

(Worf goes to stand over Calloway at the console)

CALLOWAY: Accessing Starfleet personnel records.

(Worf and Calloway talk under the dialogue, and Troi keeps looking at

them)

CRUSHER: I'd say these fragments had been in the wall about seven or

eight years. You said something happened when the panel was opened.

TROI: Yes.

CRUSHER: I wonder if the fragments themselves could have somehow

triggered your experience. I'll run a resonance scan, see if anything

turns up.

CALLOWAY: Sir, I think we've found a match.

WORF: Apparently the remains are those of an Ensign Marla Finn.

CALLOWAY: I'm trying to find a picture of her in the records.

TROI: That's her. That's the woman I saw.

CRUSHER: It says she was reported missing from Utopia Planitia on

stardate 40987.2. Eight years ago. But how did her body become embedded

in a bulkhead?

CALLOWAY: Maybe there was some kind of an accident.

WORF: Or she was killed and the murderer hid her remains.

TROI: Something's not right. Pull up Lieutenant Kwan's service record.

I thought so. He didn't arrive at the shipyard until six months after

Finn's death. I couldn't have been seeing through his eyes.

CRUSHER: Then whose?

TROI: Well it had to be someone who was at least partially telepathic.

WORF: Pierce?

CRUSHER: But you saw him there.

TROI: Yes, but not as clearly as I could see everything else. His face

looked like that.

CRUSHER: A reflection.

TROI: So I was seeing through his eyes. And Finn was trying to get away

from him. She was afraid of him.

WORF: I think it is time we had another conversation with Lieutenant

Pierce. Ensign Calloway, thank you for your help.

[Turbolift]

WORF: Deck ten.

TROI: Worf, can I ask you something? Do you regret what happened last

night?

WORF: No, of course not.

TROI: Are you sure? Because I don't want anything to jeopardise our

friendship.

WORF: Deanna, I do not regret being with you. What is wrong?

TROI: I'm not feeling myself. Maybe it's the inhibitor. I'm so used to

sensing what people are feeling, and now I can't.

WORF: Perhaps I should talk to Lieutenant Pierce alone.

TROI: That might be a good idea.

WORF: I will meet you in your quarters later.

TROI: I'll be waiting for you.

(Worf leaves)

TROI: Deck eight.

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Come in.

(it's Pierce)

TROI: Security to Counsellor Troi's quarters.

SECURITY [OC]: Acknowledged.

PIERCE: I don't understand. Lieutenant Worf said you wanted to talk to

me about something.

TROI: Where is he?

PIERCE: He said he had to go somewhere.

TROI: Troi to Worf. Computer, where is Lieutenant Worf?

COMPUTER [OC]: Lieutenant Worf is in Ensign Calloway's quarters.

(Security arrive)

CREWWOMAN: Counsellor?

TROI: Take Lieutenant Pierce to his quarters and hold him there.

[Corridor]

(Troi gets to Calloway's quarters and decides

against ringing the bell)

TROI: Security override, authorisation Troi Delta two nine.

[Calloway's quarters]

(Worf and Calloway are embracing as Troi enters.

Calloway starts laughing, then Worf.)

TROI: Stop it. Stop it! Stop it!

(Deanna grabs a convenient phaser and shoots Worf)

CALLOWAY: He's dead! You killed him!

TROI: No! No!

[Corridor]

PIERCE: You know what you have to do.

[Jefferies tube]

(Troi climbs the ladder)

[Nacelle control]

(Troi runs up the ladder to the walkway. The hatch

opens and the plasma stream is in full flow)

TROI: I know what I have to do.

(Troi step up to the edge and Worf pulls her back)

WORF: What are you doing?

COMPUTER: Warning. Plasma venting system will engage in seventy

seconds.

TROI: You're alive! You're all right!

(Troi hugs Worf with relief and joy)

[Observation lounge]

WORF: I opened the maintenance door at Counsellor

Troi's request, then turned to see her standing too close to the force

field.

TROI: It all seemed so real to me. I can't believe that everything I

experienced happened in just those few seconds.

DATA: It appears Counsellor was correct. Pierce was partially

telepathic. His maternal grandmother was born on Betazed.

PICARD: What else have you found out?

DATA: According to Starfleet records, Pierce and the other persons

Counsellor Troi identified, were killed in an accidental plasma

discharge eight years ago. Their bodies were never found.

TROI: I don't believe it was an accident. I think Lieutenant Pierce

found out the other two were having an affair. He lost control and he

killed them both. Afterwards, he probably activated the plasma stream

and then threw himself into it.

WORF: The plasma discharge would have obliterated any evidence that it

was murder.

(La Forge enters)

LAFORGE: I scanned behind the panel Counsellor Troi asked me to. I

didn't find any bone fragments but I did find some traces of cellular

residue showing some kind of psionic signature.

TROI: It may be that when Lieutenant Pierce was struck by the plasma

stream, the subspace energy present there imprinted his empathic

pattern into the residue.

LAFORGE: Kind of like a psychic photograph.

TROI: That's what triggered my hallucination. My mind must have taken

elements from my own life and then created a situation that in many

ways mirrored what happened to Pierce. If you hadn't been there, I

would have jumped just like he did.

[Bridge]

WORF: Counsellor. When I pulled you from the plasma

stream, you seemed surprised I was alive.

TROI: Well, actually, in my hallucination, you were killed.

WORF: May I ask by whom?

TROI: Well, you know what they say, Mister Worf. Hell hath no fury like

a woman scorned.

Stardate:

47653.2

Original Airdate: 21 Mar, 1994

  [Sickbay]

(It's busy in Sickbay, minor injuries everywhere.)

OGAWA: So why were you rolling around in Cypirion cactus?

RIKER: You know Rebecca Smith?

OGAWA: The new Tactical officer?

RIKER: We took a walk in the Arboretum. We sat down, we got

comfortable, things got a little romantic, and then I rolled over.

(Riker has wicked long spines sticking out of his back. Ogawa starts

pulling them out.)

BARCLAY: Blurred vision, dizziness, palpitations, a stinging sensation

in the lower spine. It's Terrelian Death Syndrome, isn't it.

CRUSHER: I thought we agreed you'd come to me before checking Starfleet

Medical Database.

BARCLAY: Yes, well, this time I'm glad I did. Maybe we can stop the

cellular decay before it's too late.

CRUSHER: Reg, you don't have Terrelian Death Syndrome.

BARCLAY: You, you're sure?

CRUSHER: I'm sure.

BARCLAY: (scans himself) Then maybe it is Symbalene blood burn.

CRUSHER: No, no. I don't see anything wrong with you at all. Wait a

minute, there is a slight imbalance in your K three cell count.

BARCLAY: My K threes? Oh, no.

CRUSHER: Barclay, I'm sure it's nothing. Look, I'll run a microcellular

scan. We'll see. This'll take a couple of minutes.

(enter Data carrying something in his arms)

CRUSHER: How's my smallest patient doing?

DATA: I believe she is doing well. Her appetite has increased by seven

percent, and she is starting to engage in prenatal behaviour.

(Spot is put down on a biobed)

CRUSHER: Oh, she's getting close. You'll have a fresh litter of hungry

kittens before the week is over. Let me just run an amniotic scan to

make sure everything's fine and then I'll

BARCLAY: Doctor! My capillaries are shrinking!

CRUSHER: Excuse me. Alyssa, can you take care of Spot for a minute?

Start a preliminary amniotic scan.

OGAWA: Yes, Doctor.

BARCLAY: My intravascular pressure, it's going right through the roof.

CRUSHER: You're right, it is elevated. You've also got heightened

electrophoretic activity.

BARCLAY: Electrophoretic activity? Is it serious?

CRUSHER: Well, based on this, I'd say you've got seventy, maybe eighty

years.

BARCLAY: Eighty? Eighty years?

CRUSHER: Yes, Reg. What you've got a mild case of Urodelan Flu. It's

nothing serious. Most humans have a natural immunity to it, but the

T-cell in your DNA that would normally fight off the infection is

dormant.

BARCLAY: So you mean I have bad genes?

CRUSHER: You have one dormant gene out of a hundred thousand, and I can

activate that gene with a synthetic T-cell let the body attack the

infection naturally. You should feel better in a couple of days.

BARCLAY: Thank you, Doctor. I feel much better.

CRUSHER: Good. Now, stay away from Medical Database. (to Riker) And you

stay out of the Arboretum.

OGAWA: Everything looks fine, Data. Do you want to know the sex of the

kittens?

DATA: I have noticed that many humans prefer not to know in order to

experience the surprise during birth. I believe I will preserve the

mystery until then.

OGAWA: I know what you mean. I don't want to know either.

CRUSHER: Alyssa?

OGAWA: Spot's not the only one who's going to be a mother.

CRUSHER: Oh, Alyssa, that's wonderful! How did Andrew take the news?

OGAWA: He was a little shocked, but he's getting over it.

DATA: I have spent the past nine weeks as an expectant parent. I would

be happy to share my insights with your husband. If my experience is

any indication, he will need all the help he can get.

Captain's log, stardate 47653.2. We're performing

field tests of our new tactical systems and weapon upgrades. Mister

Worf is supervising the exercises.

[Bridge]

WORF: The next test will involve the new photon

torpedoes. The explosive yield has been increased by eleven percent and

I have enhanced the targeting system for increased accuracy.

PICARD: Sounds fascinating, Mister Worf. Please proceed.

WORF: Setting targeting coordinates zero zero five mark three one

seven, spread pattern delta nine four. Torpedoes armed and loaded, sir.

PICARD: Fire when ready.

(only two of the three find their targets in the asteroid belt)

RIKER: Worf?

WORF: One of the torpedoes has veered off course. It appears to be a

malfunction in the guidance system.

PICARD: Abort and destroy.

WORF: The torpedo is not responding. Subspace detonator will not

engage.

RIKER: Lock on phasers.

WORF: The torpedo is out of range.

RIKER: Even for your newly improved phasers?

PICARD: Maintain a sensor lock on the torpedo, Mister Worf. We'll have

to go after it.

DATA: That would be inadvisable, sir. The asteroid field is unusually

dense. The Enterprise is too large to safely navigate through it.

PICARD: Then I'll take a shuttlecraft and retrieve it. Mister Data,

you're with me.

RIKER: Captain, the shuttle pilot who's on duty is Lieutenant Hayes.

PICARD: I happen to be a reasonably qualified pilot, Number One.

Besides, these tests hardly require the Captain's personal attention.

RIKER: Understood. Enjoy yourself.

PICARD: Mister Worf, I think that you should consider analysing your

new guidance system.

DATA: Captain, I will need a few minutes to attend to a personal

matter.

[Data's quarters]

BARCLAY: Me?

DATA: It is possible that it will take several days for Captain Picard

and me to complete our mission. I would prefer to have a human present

to supervise the birthing process.

BARCLAY: Well, I'd be honoured.

DATA: I have noticed that you are the only other member of the crew

whom Spot seems to like.

BARCLAY: Really? That's hard to believe. You're such a sweet little

kitty.

DATA: She is to you. However, there have been several injuries to other

members of the crew who have attempted to care for her.

BARCLAY: So, has she picked a place?

DATA: A place?

BARCLAY: Cats usually like to pick a specific location to give birth.

It's usually dark and secluded, and I believe this is it.

(Barclay drops Spot down behind a chair)

BARCLAY: I'm curious, sir. Who's the father?

DATA: I am not certain. Spot has escaped from my quarters on several

occasions and there are twelve male felines on board. I intend to run a

full DNA analysis on the kittens once they

PICARD [OC]: Picard to Data. Report to Shuttlebay two.

DATA: On my way, sir. Goodbye, Spot. I believe you are in good hands.

BARCLAY: You have nothing to worry about, sir.

[Bridge]

(Worf is getting frustrated at a science station)

RIKER: Problem?

WORF: I have performed thirteen diagnostics of the weapons array, and I

can find nothing wrong with the guidance system.

RIKER: I'll have Geordi run a diagnostic of the torpedo bay itself.

Maybe he can find something.

WORF: Must you to stand so close to me?

RIKER: Lieutenant, are you all right?

WORF: Yes, I am fine.

RIKER: No, you're not. You've been working for six hours straight.

You're tired. Take a break.

WORF: But

RIKER: That's an order, Lieutenant.

[Ten Forward]

(Worf is wolfing down food)

TROI: Thanks for waiting.

WORF: Do not approach me unannounced, especially when I'm eating.

TROI: Worf we were supposed to have lunch together, remember?

WORF: I was hungry.

TROI: Well, I'm hungry too. Excuse me.

WAITRESS: Yes?

TROI: Can I have an order of Ongilin caviar. Make that a double order.

WAITRESS: Certainly.

WORF: Caviar? For lunch?

TROI: I'm in the mood for something salty. Besides, it's no stranger

than what you're eating. (downs a glass of water) Have you noticed how

dry the air is on the ship? I wonder if the environmental controls are

set properly.

(Worf belches)

TROI: You're excused.

(Troi's caviar arrives)

TROI: Is something wrong?

WORF: It has been a difficult day. The torpedo guidance system failed.

It was my fault.

TROI: You always say that.

WORF: It was my fault! I designed that guidance system.

TROI: Worf, calm down. I think you're under more stress than you'd like

to admit. Maybe you should get some rest.

WORF: Perhaps you are right. If you will excuse me.

TROI: I didn't mean right now. (and has another glass of water)

[Worf's quarters]

(Worf can't sleep. He rips his sheet, prowls the

room semi-crouched then guts the bed for material to make a nest on the

floor. Now he can sleep)

[Engineering]

BARCLAY: We removed the torpedo bay's primary

guidance module and found a power fluctuation in the forward sensor

cluster. Now we think it may be a radial imbalance in the phase

discriminator. Now what we want to do next is run a level four

diagnostic, but we're going to have to shut down auxiliary power to

nineteen decks and

RIKER: Wait a minute. Slow down. I lost you back there. Which sensor

clusters?

BARCLAY: The forward. It's, it's a power fluctuation in the converter

nodes. It's a minor adjustment. It's minor.

LAFORGE: It's all right in here in on diagram, Commander.

RIKER: I'll look this over later. Go ahead. You run your diagnostic.

I'll inform the other departments about the power systems.

(an alarm beeps) BARCLAY: I'll check that.

RIKER: He's full of energy today.

LAFORGE: I can't get him to slow down. He's been working like that

since last night,

BARCLAY: Looks like a plasma conduit cut out in junction seventeen.

I'll go look at it.

LAFORGE: Wait a minute, Reg, I'll go with you. Keep you posted.

[Bridge]

(Troi is the Bridge Officer, and is shivering)

TROI: Computer, increase ambient temperature by two degrees Centigrade

and increase relative humidity by ten percent.

WORF: Computer, reset environmental controls to standard.

TROI: Worf, it's freezing in here.

WORF: You have already raised the temperature three times. It is too

hot.

TROI: Live with it. Computer, execute my original command.

(she finally can't stand it)

TROI: I need a bath. You have the Bridge.

[Jefferies tube]

(a panel has been eaten by acid or something)

BARCLAY: Here we are. Looks like a conduit ruptured. No problem, I'll

just bypass it.

LAFORGE: Reg, wait a second here. Take a look at these corroded edges

here. It looks like something has dissolved the bulkhead and eaten

right through the conduit. There are high levels of cholic acid here.

Enzymatic agents. You know, I wouldn't be surprised if that solvent was

organic.

BARCLAY: Maybe we should run a biospectral analysis on the solvent.

Take a closer look.

LAFORGE: That's a very good idea, but first we should take a break.

BARCLAY: You go ahead, sir. I'll take care of it.

[Bridge]

DERN: (at the helm) Commander, we received a

communication from Starfleet. They wanted to know when they could

expect your performance analysis of the new weapon systems.

RIKER: The weapon systems?

DERN: Yes, sir. The ones we've been testing for the past few days?

RIKER: That's right.

DERN: What should I tell them, sir?

RIKER: Tell them, tell them we haven't finished yet.

[Troi's quarters]

(Troi is in a bath, fully clothed, when Worf

enters)

TROI: What are you doing here?

WORF: I had to be near you.

TROI: Computer, increase temperature by five degrees.

WORF: Get out of that water now.

TROI: Leave me alone!

(Worf grabs her arm and bites her on the cheek)

[Sickbay]

TROI: Can I have a glass of water? It's so cold in

here.

CRUSHER: Your temperature has dropped almost eight degrees. I want to

run a hypothalamic series right away.

OGAWA: Doctor, we've had three other crewmembers complaining about the

temperature levels. Some feel like they have fevers, others are

freezing like Counsellor Troi.

CRUSHER: Call Doctor Selar and Doctor Hacopian. It looks like we've got

some sort of viral infection going on around here. I want to check on

Lieutenant Worf.

(at another bed, Worf is under guard)

CRUSHER: Worf, have you had any unusual symptoms lately? Headaches,

nausea, dizziness? Worf? Worf, do you hear me? I going to run a full

bioscan. I want you to lie down. (he doesn't move.) Okay, we can do

this sitting up. What is this? (a growth on his

jaw line) Worf, how long have you had this on your neck? It looks like

it's full of some bioacidic compound, almost like a venom sac. Worf,

open your mouth.

(Worf opens his mouth and sprays venom into Beverly's face. She

collapses, screaming in pain and Worf escapes)

OGAWA: Get a hypospray.

NURSE: Right away.

[Observation lounge]

OGAWA: I managed to get her into stasis before the

venom paralysed her. She's going to need reconstructive surgery, but I

think she'll be all right.

BARCLAY: (who can't stay still) Sir, we've analysed the venom and

compared it to the acidic compound found in junction seventeen and on

decks ten and twelve. They all have the same enzymatic composition.

RIKER: Are you saying that Worf is spraying this

BARCLAY: Venom.

RIKER: Venom all over the ship?

BARCLAY: I'd say so.

OGAWA: Sixty crewmen have begun exhibiting strange behavioural changes.

Memory loss, fatigue, headaches. I think one thing is clear. There's

some sort of disease aboard the Enterprise and it's spreading.

RIKER: I'm having trouble concentrating myself. It's like my mind keeps

wandering. I can't

(La Forge runs in)

LAFORGE: Commander, I've got seven security teams out hunting for Worf,

but for some reason sensors are having a difficult time locking onto

him. I've called for a level two security alert. Do you think we should

go to a Level One?

RIKER: I don't know. What do you think?

LAFORGE: I think we should.

RIKER: Okay. Sounds good. Then you'll take care of that security thing?

LAFORGE: Yes, sir. I will.

RIKER: Okay, I'll notify Starfleet. I'll let them know what's

happening. You have your orders. (Barclays already out the door)

Dismissed.

(Ogawa stands, resting with her knuckles on the desk, looks around then

walks out with a very rolling gait.)

RIKER: Computer, send a subspace message to Starfleet command. Security

channel authorisation.

COMPUTER: Alpha four seven authorisation required to activate security

channel.

RIKER: Computer.

COMPUTER: Awaiting authorisation.

(too late, he's off with the fairies)

Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Data and I

have recovered the stray torpedo after a three day search. We are

enroute back to the Enterprise.

[Shuttlecraft]

DATA: Captain, the ship is not at the pre-arranged

coordinates.

PICARD: Have they been delayed?

DATA: I do not know. I am unable to raise them on any communication

channel.

PICARD: Scan the vicinity. See if you can find them.

DATA: I found it, sir, two light years away.

PICARD: Set a course.

(whoosh)

DATA: The Enterprise appears to be adrift. I am reading power

fluctuations on all decks.

PICARD: Life signs?

DATA: There are life signs. However, sensor readings are highly

distorted. I am unable to identify specific lifeforms.

PICARD: Adjust the axial stabilisers to match the attitude and rotation

rate of the Enterprise, I'm going to dock the shuttle manually.

[Shuttlebay]

DATA: Main power is offline. All systems are in

standby or emergency mode. There is no response from any manned

station.

PICARD: Any sign of the crew?

DATA: I cannot access internal sensors from here. We will have to go to

the Bridge.

[Corridor]

(strange calls in the air)

PICARD: That sounds like animals.

DATA: Yes, sir. I am able to discern over three hundred different

vocalisations.

(something large rattles along a Jefferies tube)

PICARD: Look at this.

(a shed skin)

DATA: It is composed of reptilian DNA. I believe it is an epidermal

layer that has been cast off during moulting.

PICARD: But it seems to be humanoid.

DATA: Yes, sir. I cannot explain it. There are no species aboard the

Enterprise that shed their skin in this fashion.

(a little further along there is a door covered in condensation)

DATA: Sir.

PICARD: These are Commander Troi's quarters. Can you tell if she's

inside?

DATA: No, sir.

PICARD: Data, I want to have a look in here. Stand ready.

[Troi's quarters]

(it's tropical inside, water is dripping from the

ceiling)

PICARD: The environmental settings in these quarters have been altered.

Data, over here.

(They go into the bathroom. Troi is underwater so Picard pulls her out)

PICARD: Deanna.

(she starts gasping.)

PICARD: What's happened to her?

DATA: Her DNA is in a state of ribocyatic flux. Her genetic codes are

being re-sequenced and her cells are mutating as a result. At a

fundamental level, sir, she is no longer human.

PICARD: What is she?

DATA: Her respiratory tissue has become capable of metabolising both

water and air, and her eyes have developed nictitating membranes. I

believe she is amphibian, sir.

PICARD: She has been injured.

DATA: Yes, sir. There's Klingon DNA in the wound. It is saliva.

PICARD: Are you saying she's been bitten?

DATA: It would appear so.

(Deanna go back underwater)

DATA: I will need to run a full biospectral analysis.

PICARD: First we've got to get the ship under control. Let's go to the

Bridge.

[Bridge]

(Dern is dead, with scratches across his chest)

DATA: His upper spinal column has been broken in three places.

PICARD: It looks like he's been attacked by some sort of animal.

DATA: Yes, sir.

PICARD: Has his DNA been changed as well?

DATA: Yes, sir. However, it was in its initial stages when he died.

Captain, I am picking up one thousand and eleven individual life forms

within the ship. All exhibit a similar genetic flux to the one we

observed in Counsellor Troi.

PICARD: So the entire ship has been affected.

DATA: Most of the lifeforms are scattered throughout the ship. However,

there are several large concentrations in the arboretum and the aquatic

lab.

PICARD: I've regained attitude control for the ship, but main power is

still offline. It looks as though the entire power transfer grid has

been destroyed.

(there's thumping from the ready room)

[Ready room]

(Riker is trying to get at Livingston the fish.

He's hairy and brutish and his uniform has split at the shoulders)

PICARD: Will?

DATA: Captain. His cranial plates have thickened by twenty percent. His

brain is much smaller, sir. I do not believe he can comprehend our

language.

PICARD: Perhaps we can find a way to communicate. Will, can you

understand what it is that

(Riker attacks Picard and Data stuns him using two shots)

PICARD: He looks almost proto-human.

DATA: Yes, sir. His DNA would seem to confirm that observation.

Captain, I believe the crew is de-evolving.

[Sickbay]

PICARD: This tranquilliser should keep him

unconscious for another seven hours. What have you found out?

DATA: I have analysed Commander Riker's DNA structure. A synthetic

T-cell has invaded his genetic codes. This T-cell has begun to activate

his latent introns.

PICARD: Introns?

DATA: They are genetic codes which are normally dormant. They are

evolutionary holdovers, sequences of DNA that provided key behavioural

and physical characteristics millions of years ago, but are no longer

necessary. For instance, Counsellor Troi's gill slits and other

amphibious characteristics were derived from introns which still

contain amphibious codes.

PICARD: So these introns are causing her DNA to re-combine in an

earlier configuration?

DATA: That is correct. In her case, the DNA has created an amphibious

lifeform which became extinct over fifty million years ago.

PICARD: And Commander Riker's introns are changing him into what

appears to be one of the earlier hominids.

DATA: Yes, sir. I would say Australopithecine. Each of these stages is

another link in the evolutionary chain which stretches back to the

origins of all lifeforms on Earth. Because introns can include genetic

material from many different species over millions of years of

evolution, it is possible that a wide variety of transformations is

occurring among the crew.

PICARD: What about those crewmembers who are not from Earth?

DATA: All humanoid life has a similar genetic pattern. The virus should

work on non-human crewmembers in the same way. They are each

de-evolving to earlier forms of life on their homeworlds. I feel I must

inform you, sir, you have also been infected by the intron virus.

PICARD: How long before I begin to change?

DATA: According to my calculations, within the next twelve hours, you

will begin to exhibit the first signs of your eventual transformation.

PICARD: And what will that be 

DATA: I believe you will also de-evolve into some form of early

primate. Possibly similar to a lemur, or a pygmy marmoset.

PICARD: Well, before I begin swinging through the ship looking for

breakfast, we'd better find some answers. How do we reverse the

process?

DATA: I am uncertain. We will need to run several microcellular scans.

However, the ship's main computer has been damaged. Captain, the

computer in my quarters has an independent processing and memory

storage unit. It should not be affected. I suggest we start from there.

PICARD: Agreed.

[Data's quarters]

(mewing sound)

DATA: It would appear that Spot has had her kittens.

PICARD: They sound hungry.

DATA: Yes. I am curious as to why Spot is not caring for them.

(it's because on the carpet is an iguana with a pink collar)

PICARD: It would seem the intron virus is not limited to humanoid

lifeforms.

DATA: No, sir.

PICARD: What is it?

DATA: These kittens were born less than twenty four hours. It would

appear that Spot's transformation took place at approximately the same

time.

PICARD: So Spot was giving birth to the kittens at the same time that

she was changing into a reptilian lifeform.

DATA: I believe so. For some reason, the intron virus was not passed on

to the kittens. I do not know why.

PICARD: If I remember my biology, there are several natural immune

systems that come into play in the mother's womb to protect the foetus

from viral infections.

DATA: That is true. Placental barrier, maternal antibodies and amniotic

fluids all serve as a filtration system.

PICARD: Maybe we could have inhibited the intron virus by using the

natural antibodies in Spot's amniotic fluid.

DATA: It would take further research, but I believe to be effective on

humanoid crewmembers, humanoid antibodies would be necessary.

PICARD: Then we should locate a pregnant humanoid.

DATA: Nurse Ogawa has recently became pregnant.

PICARD: Where is she?

DATA: I have traced her comm. badge signal to deck seventeen, section

twenty one alpha.

PICARD: The Arboretum.

(ship shake)

DATA: One of the warp plasma vents has failed. Main Engineering has

been abandoned. There is no one there to fix the problem.

[Engineering]

DATA: I can repair the damaged plasma vent from

here.

PICARD: I'm going to check the status of the warp core.

(it's dark, and cobwebs are everywhere. Picard looks through a window

at the warp core and something with half a face and a few compound eyes

throws itself at the glass)

PICARD: Data!

(it skitters away)

PICARD: What was that?

DATA: I believe it was Lieutenant Barclay. He appeared to be partially

transformed into an arachnid.

PICARD: A spider?

DATA: Yes, sir. Are you all right, Captain?

PICARD: I have these intense feelings of fear and panic. I feel as if I

were being watched. I can't explain it.

DATA: You may be experiencing the initial stages of your

transformation. Early primates were often prey to larger carnivores. As

a result, their instincts probably included a heightened sense of

awareness.

PICARD: In that case, my instincts tell me that we'd better hurry.

[Sickbay]

(Alyssa the ape is on a biobed and Picard is biting

his nails)

DATA: Captain, I have analysed Nurse Ogawa's embryo. It has been

unaffected by the virus. I believe I can use her amniotic fluid as a

template for a retrovirus. It would neutralise the synthetic T-cell,

and re-establish the original genetic patterns of each host.

PICARD: How soon can you do that?

DATA: It will not take long to isolate the appropriate genetic

material. I will need to get the Sickbay computer back on

(something tries to batter down the door)

PICARD: What was that?

DATA: It is large. Approximately two hundred kilograms. It is heavily

armored with an exoskeleton. Life signs appear to be Klingon.

PICARD: Worf.

(the door starts to buckle)

PICARD: Set your phaser to heavy stun.

DATA: We cannot be certain a stun setting will have any effect on him.

A higher setting may kill him.

(the wide shot shows Riker and Troi are also on biobeds)

PICARD: Listen to that. He sounds very angry, really, really

aggressive. What do you think he wants? Do you think he's responding to

some predatory instinct? Do you think he see us as prey?

DATA: There are crewmembers in the corridors and other sections of the

ship. It would be much easier for him to capture and consume one of

them, than to attempt to break through a door.

PICARD: Then what does he want? Predators use vocalisations to frighten

other predators and to mark territory, and to commence mating process.

A mating process. Counsellor Troi was bitten by a Klingon but not in a

place that might be life-threatening. Nowhere near a major artery or

organ. Data, look at this. Look at this injury. This wound was never

intended to give her any kind of serious harm.

DATA: Captain, what are you suggesting?

PICARD: Is it possible that Worf could see Counsellor Troi as his mate?

DATA: If that is true, he must be trying to reach her now.

PICARD: Well, we can't just leave. We have to stay here and protect

her. And we have to keep on working on the retrovirus. If we could

distract him, if we could lure him away from her.

DATA: The mating instinct is quite strong in Klingon biology. I am not

certain what would be an effective lure.

PICARD: Klingons have got a very powerful sense of smell. If we could

duplicate Deanna's pheromones and then convince him she's no longer in

Sickbay, that she'd gone into some other part of the ship.

DATA: I am extracting a blood sample from one of her sebaceous glands,

where the pheromones are produced. I believe I can activate the

pheromones with a bioactivant solution.

PICARD: Can you amplify the pheromones? They need to be much more

powerful than Deanna's actual scent.

DATA: I believe this will produce the desired effect. I will use it to

draw Worf to a another part of the ship.

PICARD: No, no, no. You must go on working on the retrovirus. I'll go.

DATA: Captain, that is extremely unwise. Worf may be much faster than

PICARD: No time. No time to argue.

[Corridor]

(the terrified not-yet-a-proto-lemur sneaks out

through Crusher's office door and squirts the scent into the air,

backing down the dark corridor. The armoured monster leaves the door

and follows the trail)

[Turbolift]

PICARD: Deck seventeen. Deck seventeen!

(the doors shut in the nick of time but it doesn't move. Worf starts

hammering at the door and Picard escapes through the roof)

[Sickbay]

(Data gives Alyssa a hypospray)

DATA: Computer, display progress of genetic re-sequencing.

[Jefferies tube]

(Worf sprays venom on Picard's arm from above

through a grating and Picard drops the phaser)

[Sickbay]

COMPUTER: Genetic re-sequencing in progress. DNA to

seventy percent normal.

DATA: Computer, increase nucleotide substitution by thirty two percent.

[Jefferies tube]

(at the point of the original hole, Picard

insulates himself on a panel cover and jabs a live cable onto the metal

framework. Finally Worf collapses.)

[Sickbay]

(Alyssa is back to normal)

DATA: Data to Captain Picard.

[Jefferies tube]

PICARD: Go ahead, Data.

DATA: The retro virus is working, sir.

[Sickbay]

DATA: I can release it into the ship's atmosphere

in a gaseous state.

[Jefferies tube]

DATA [OC]: However it will take some time to take

effect.

PICARD: Acknowledged.

[Sickbay]

DATA: Are you all right, sir?

PICARD [OC]: Yes, I'm

[Jefferies tube]

PICARD: Fine, Mister Data. Proceed. (Worf snores)

Well, Mister Worf, let's hope that when you wake up, you're a new man.

Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Data has

succeeded in returning the crew to normal. Doctor Crusher has

determined that the synthetic T-cell she used to cure Mister Barclay's

Urodelan flu initiated the intron virus which swept through the ship.

[Sickbay]

BARCLAY: So, this is my fault?

CRUSHER: No. In a way it's mine. I didn't realise it at the time, but

there's an anomaly in your genetic chemistry that caused the synthetic

T-cell to mutate. Instead of activating one dormant gene, it started

activating all of them, including your introns.

BARCLAY: And that's what er, and that's what caused me to devolve?

CRUSHER: You and every other member of the crew. The T-cell became

airborne and started to spread like a virus. You know, Reg, this is a

completely new disease, and it's traditional to classify a new disease

with the name of the first diagnosed patient.

BARCLAY: Oh! You mean you want to name the disease after me?

CRUSHER: That's right. How about Barclay's Protomorphosis Syndrome?

BARCLAY: Barclay's Protomorphosis. It has a nice ring to it. Thank you,

Doctor.

(Barclay leaves)

CRUSHER: He transformed into a spider and now he has a disease named

after him.

TROI: I think I'd better clear my calendar for the next few weeks.

Journey's

End

Stardate:

47751.2

Original Airdate: 28 Mar, 1994



Captain's log, stardate 47751.2. The Enterprise has arrived at Starbase

three one zero for a meeting with Fleet Admiral Necheyev. This visit

will also give us the opportunity to pick up a member of the family.

[Wesley's quarters]

CRUSHER: Here you are, your very own quarters.

They're as far away from mine as possible, so you don't even have to

see me if you don't want to.

WESLEY: Mom, you know that's not why I asked for my own quarters this

time.

CRUSHER: You don't have to explain. There comes a time in a young man's

life when he doesn't want to stay with his poor senile mother. I

understand.

WESLEY: I'll come visit you in the old Doctor's Home every Sunday.

(doorbell)

WESLEY: Come in.

LAFORGE: So, is there a runaway cadet in here?

DATA: If so, we may have to call Security.

LAFORGE: Welcome back, Wes.

WESLEY: Thanks.

LAFORGE: So, how's life at the Academy?

WESLEY: (sigh) It's great. It's great but it's good to have a break.

DATA: I was of course not serious about calling Security. It was a

joke.

WESLEY: I got it, Data.

LAFORGE: So, are you just going to lounge while we all have work to do

around here?

WESLEY: I'm sure I can find some time to help you, sir.

LAFORGE: Wes, enjoy your vacation. I'm sure you've earned it.

WESLEY: Thanks.

CRUSHER: Well, I think we'd better let you settle in.

LAFORGE: Yeah, that's a good idea. Say, Wes, don't sleep your whole

vacation away, all right?

DATA: Goodbye, Wes.

(Data and Geordi leave)

CRUSHER: It's good to have you home, son.

WESLEY: Thanks, Mom.

CRUSHER: Really.

(Beverly leaves, Wesley sighs and sits on his bed, obviously unhappy

about something)

[Observation lounge]

(tea and nibbles is being laid on)

RIKER: Admiral Necheyev has just beamed aboard. She's being escorted

right here.

PICARD: Good.

RIKER: Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches and Bularian canapés. Are

you up for a promotion?

PICARD: I am trying to establish a new relationship with the Admiral.

There has been a certain amount of tension between us in the past.

RIKER: Tension is hardly the word I'd use.

PICARD: Well, I am trying to get things off on a better note this time.

I want to make her feel at ease. I want her to feel that she's welcome

aboard the Enterprise.

RIKER: Is there any reason she shouldn't feel welcome here?

PICARD: We don't have to like her, Will, but we have to follow her

orders, and maintaining this atmosphere of confrontation serves no

purpose.

(a security officer and the tiny woman enter)

PICARD: Admiral Necheyev, welcome aboard the Enterprise.

NECHEYEV: Thank you. You may leave, Commander Riker.

RIKER: Thank you, Admiral. Captain.

(Riker and Security leave)

PICARD: May I offer you some refreshment?

NECHEYEV: I'll come right to the point, Captain. There is a situation

that's developed on the Cardassian border that. (double-take) Are those

Bularian

canapés?

PICARD: As a matter of fact, they are. I spoke with your aide,

Commander Wrightwell, and he said that you were particularly fond of

them.

NECHEYEV: That was very thoughtful, Captain. Thank you.

PICARD: Please. You were saying about the Cardassians?

(Picard pours the tea)

NECHEYEV: Yes. The Federation has just completed a very long and

drawn-out series of negotiations regarding the final status of our

border with the Cardassians. These will be the official boundaries.

(she hands over a PADD)

PICARD: I see.

NECHEYEV: You'll notice a demilitarised zone has also been created

along the border. Neither side will be permitted to place military

outposts, conduct fleet exercises, or station warships anywhere in the

demilitarised area.

PICARD: This border places several Federation colonies in Cardassian

territory and some Cardassian colonies in ours.

NECHEYEV: This agreement is far from perfect. Neither side got

everything they wanted, but every side got something. And as someone

once said, diplomacy is the art of the possible. Those colonies finding

themselves on the wrong side of the border will have to be moved.

PICARD: Well, the colonists are not going to be happy about that. Some

of them have been there for decades.

NECHEYEV: It won't be easy, but it's a reasonable price to pay for

peace. Your mission will be to evacuate the colony on Dorvan Five.

PICARD: Dorvan Five? Isn't that where the group of North American

Indians settled?

NECHEYEV: Yes. They've been there for about twenty years. They've

established a village in a small valley on the southern continent. Is

something wrong?

PICARD: Admiral, centuries ago these North American Indians were

forcibly displaced from their ancestral lands. These settlers on Dorvan

Five originally left Earth more than two hundred years ago in order to

preserve their cultural identities.

NECHEYEV: I am aware of that, Captain.

PICARD: You see, Admiral, there are some very disturbing historical

parallels here. Once more, they're being asked to leave their homes

because of a political decision that has been taken by a distant

government.

NECHEYEV: An Indian representative was included in the deliberations of

the Federation Council. His objections were noted, discussed, but

ultimately rejected. Captain, the Indians on Dorvan are a nomadic group

that have settled there only twenty years ago, and at that time they

were warned that the planet was hotly disputed by the Cardassians. The

bottom line is they never should have gone there in the first place.

PICARD: Granted, but to go to them now after twenty years later and ask

them to leave what is now their home.

NECHEYEV: I made that same argument with the Federation Council. But it

took three years to negotiate this treaty.

Some concessions had to be made, and this is one of them.

PICARD: What if these Indians refuse to be evacuated?

NECHEYEV: Then your orders will be to remove them by whatever means are

necessary. I understand your moral objections, Captain. If you wish, I

can find someone else to command the Enterprise for this mission.

PICARD: That will not be necessary, Admiral.

NECHEYEV: I don't envy you this task, but I do believe it is for the

greater good.

PICARD: I understand.

NECHEYEV: And Captain, thank you for making me feel welcome.

PICARD: You will always be welcome aboard this ship, Admiral.

[Engineering]

(Wesley is not in uniform)

LAFORGE: Thanks, Ensign. Hey, Wes! There you are. Come here for a

second. I've got something I want to show you. Come on, come on. You've

got to take a look at this. Now, remember how we always used to talk

about improving quantum efficiency by creating a new plasmadyne relay?

Well, take a look at this.

WESLEY: You've only got one microfusion interrelay in there? Your

converter interface'll never hold up.

LAFORGE: Hey, I ran these diagnostics myself. This little baby will

withstand over five hundred Cochranes of warp field stress.

WESLEY: I don't think so. You better put a secondary phase inverter in

there. Look at your subprocessor matrix. It needs an overhaul.

LAFORGE: Well, that may be your opinion, Cadet, but I stand by my work.

WESLEY: Read the latest paper from Doctor Vassbinder. He has brilliant

new theories on warp propulsion inter-relays. He's say all this stuff

is obsolete.

LAFORGE: I don't know what's gotten into you, Wes.

WESLEY: Look, do you want my help or not?

LAFORGE: With this kind of an attitude, absolutely not. You're

dismissed.

Captain's log, supplemental. The Enterprise has

arrived at Dorvan Five and I have spoken to the Leader of the Tribal

Council. He has agreed to meet with us this afternoon to discuss the

situation.

[Meeting room]

(the five members of the tribal council are sitting

around the table)

PICARD: Anthwara, there's very little I can do. The decision about this

planet was made at the very highest level of Starfleet.

WAKASA: (a young man) Do you know how long we have searched for a home?

Almost two hundred years. Then we found this world. Can you blame us

for not wanting to give it up?

PICARD: I understand and I respect your people's long journey, but I

believe that I can help you to find a new home.

TROI: As you can see, there are three other planets in this sector that

have environmental conditions similar to those here on Dorvan Five.

They're all uninhabited and could be colonised immediately.

PICARD: And if none of these worlds meet with your approval, then we'll

find you other choices.

ANTHWARA: (a lovely mane of white hair) You do not understand, Captain.

The choice of this world was not only because of environmental

conditions. There were other more intangible concerns as well. When I

came here twenty years ago, I was welcomed by the mountains, the

rivers, the sky.

WAKASA: Anthwara, he's laughing at you. He thinks you're talking about

old superstition and nonsense.

PICARD: This is not true. I have the deepest deal of respect for your

beliefs and the meaning that they hold for your people.

ANTHWARA: Then you can respect the fact that this planet holds a deep

spiritual significance for us. It has taken us two centuries to find

this place. We do not want to spend another two hundred years searching

for what we already have.

TROI: Captain, I suggest we adjourn. Allow us all time to think about

what's been said.

ANTHWARA: Agreed. We will reconvene tomorrow.

PICARD: And in the meantime, I would like to invite you all to join us

this evening on the Enterprise.

ANTHWARA: Thank you. We look forward to it.

[Wesley's quarters]

CRUSHER: Ever since you've come on board you've

been moody, sullen and rude. What's going on?

WESLEY: Nothing. I just want to be left alone.

CRUSHER: That incident in Engineering was inexcusable.

WESLEY: That is my business. I don't need you telling me how to behave.

CRUSHER: I shouldn't have to. You're a fourth year Starfleet cadet. You

should have a certain level of maturity.

WESLEY: Maybe I am sick of following rules and regulations. Maybe I am

sick of living up to everyone else's expectations. Did you ever think

of that?

[Ten Forward]

PICARD: I have been fascinated looking into the

history and traditions of your people, and I was very interested to

learn that your grandfather, Katowa, was the man who first led the

group of Indians from Earth initially more than two hundred years ago.

ANTHWARA: There was great deal of opposition. Even my own father was

against it. But when Katowa made his decision, it was final. My father

never said another word.

PICARD: It's never easy to leave one's home, the safe and the familiar.

But there are times when the greater good demands that certain

sacrifices are made. I'm sure that was something that your grandfather

understood.

ANTHWARA: So does his grandson. There are also times when a people

sacrificed too much. When a people must hold on to what we have, even

against overwhelming opposition. What do you know about your family,

Captain?

PICARD: Well, a great deal actually. My father was a strong believer in

passing on the traditions and history of the family.

ANTHWARA: I would like to know more about your family. We have very

strong ties to our ancestors. We believe their actions guide us even

now. Knowing more about your family might help me to better understand

you. Besides, it is always good to understand one's adversary in any

negotiation.

PICARD: I hope that by the end of this matter, you will no longer look

at me as an adversary. My family. Well, our roots in Western Europe go

back to the time of Charlemagne.

WESLEY: I'm sorry I'm late.

CRUSHER: We'll talk about it later.

(Wesley goes and sits at an empty table)

LAKANTA: Wesley Crusher?

WESLEY: Yes?

LAKANTA: I am Lakanta.

WESLEY: It's nice to meet you. Can I get you a drink or something.

LAKANTA: I have known that you were coming to us for the past two

years. Two years ago, I went into the Habak and began a vision quest.

While I was there I saw many things, talked to many animals, many

spirits. And I saw you.

WESLEY: I don't think I understand.

LAKANTA: I know why you came to us, Wesley. To find the answers that

you seek.

[Picard's quarters]

CRUSHER: I just don't know what to do, Jean-Luc.

It's as if somebody took my son away and left this stranger in his

place.

PICARD: But in a sense, that's exactly what happened. Wesley left the

Enterprise three years ago he was a boy, and now he's returned a young

man. And that can't be easy for a mother or a son.

CRUSHER: It's gone beyond just the two of us.

PICARD: Yes, I heard about the incident with Geordi.

CRUSHER: Have you heard what happened at the Academy? I called Admiral

Brand today. She said his grades are dropping, that he's becoming

remote and defensive. If he's not careful, he's going to wash out next

term. Maybe you should talk to him, Jean-Luc. Maybe it's the kind of

thing a boy, a man needs to discuss with another man.

PICARD: I don't think he wants either of us to talk to him right now.

CRUSHER: But he needs out help.

PICARD: Beverly, he's got to want that help. If he doesn't, then any

efforts on our part can only push him further away. He's got to work

this out for himself.

[Village]

WESLEY: How long have you been watching me?

LAKANTA: Since you beamed down.

WESLEY: Well, I'm here. What should I do?

LAKANTA: I don't know.

WESLEY: I thought you were going to help me find some answers.

LAKANTA: Answers to your questions.

WESLEY: Tell me about this Habak. You said you had some kind of a

vision there?

LAKANTA: The Habak is holy to us. We hold our rituals and our

ceremonies there. It's sacred to us. What's sacred to you, Wesley?

WESLEY: I don't know. I mean, I think a lot of things are important, I

have a lot of respect for things. But I don't really consider anything

sacred.

LAKANTA: Look around us. What do you think is sacred to us here?

WESLEY: Maybe the necklace you're wearing? The designs on the walls?

LAKANTA: Everything is sacred to us. The buildings, the food, the sky,

the dirt beneath your feet. And you. Whether you believe in your spirit

or not, we believe in it. You are a sacred person here, Wesley.

WESLEY: I think that's the first time anyone's used that particular

word to describe me.

LAKANTA: So, if you are sacred, then you must treat yourself with

respect. To do otherwise is to desecrate something that is holy.

WESLEY: Is that what you think I've been doing?

LAKANTA: Only you can decide that.

WESLEY: I guess I haven't had a lot of respect for myself lately.

LAKANTA: Then perhaps it's time for your own vision quest to begin.

[Meeting room]

PICARD: Anthwara, I deeply regret that we have not

been able to reach an agreement. But, and I must be blunt, I cannot

take no for an answer. This planet will be handed over to the

Cardassian government in accordance with the terms of the border

agreement. I am very sorry, but you will have to leave.

WAKASA: And if we do not?

PICARD: Then I will be forced to remove you by whatever means are

necessary.

ANTHWARA: We know you will not take us from this land, Captain.

PICARD: I may regret doing it, but I am not able

ANTHWARA: When you first came to us, we did not know why you were sent

by the Federation but we knew there must be a good reason. To us,

nothing that happens is truly random. So we searched for the true

reason you were sent. We did not find it until last night. Are you

familiar with the Pueblo Revolt of sixteen eighty?

TROI: I am. Several Indian tribes rose up to overthrow their Spanish

overlords and drove them out of what is now called New Mexico.

ANTHWARA: Ten years later, the Spanish returned to reconquer the area.

They were brutal. I would use the word savage. They killed hundreds of

our people. Thousands more were maimed. The name of one of the soldiers

was Javier Maribona-Picard. Your ancestor.

PICARD: I'm not aware of this incident or of the man you named, and

this happened seven hundred years ago. I do not see what bearing it can

have

ANTHWARA: That is why you have come to us, to erase a stain of blood

worn by your family for twenty three generations.

[Village]

PICARD: Mister Worf, what is going on?

WORF: We have unwelcome visitors, sir.

(the Cardassians have arrived)

PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.

GUL EVEK: I am Gul Evek. What are all these people still doing here?

The evacuation should be well underway by now.

PICARD: May I have a word with you, alone?

GUL EVEK: As you wish. Wait here.

PICARD: It was my understanding that there would be no Cardassian

presence here for another six weeks. Your arrival here may have upset

some very delicate negotiations.

GUL EVEK: Negotiations? The status of this planet has been settled.

What are you negotiating?

PICARD: I would be very happy to explain that to you, but for now I

must ask you and your men to leave immediately.

GUL EVEK: Captain, we have been sent here to perform a preliminary

survey of all the buildings and equipment being left behind. I have no

intention of leaving until our mission is complete.

PICARD: Very well. Complete your mission. But remember, this is

Federation territory, Gul Evek, and until that changes, these people

are under my jurisdiction and I will protect them.

GUL EVEK: Is that a threat?

PICARD: It's a fact. Bear that in mind while you conduct your survey.

[Habak]

(entered by a ladder through a hole in the floor)

LAKANTA: This is the Habak, the focal point of our lives. Strangers are

not welcome here.

WESLEY: When I asked to come here, you said it would be

LAKANTA: You're not a stranger. I told you, I've seen you here before.

WESLEY: What are those figures?

LAKANTA: They are Mansara. Dolls that represent the different spirits

that come to this place.

WESLEY: This one looks like a Klingon.

LAKANTA: Yes. Our culture is rooted in the past, but it's not limited

to the past.

(He scatters sand around the fire)

LAKANTA: The spirits of the Klingon, the Vulcan, the Ferengi come to us

just as the bear and the coyote and the parrot. There's no difference.

WESLEY: What should I do?

LAKANTA: Start the fire. Then sit and wait.

WESLEY: What am I waiting for?

LAKANTA: This is your journey, Wesley. I can open the door, but only

you can go through it.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Admiral, the Indian Councils is adamant.

They refuse to leave Dorvan Five. NECHEYEV [on monitor]: Is there any

indication that the Tribal Council will change their position in the

near future?

PICARD: No, sir.

NECHEYEV [on monitor]: Then I see no other choice.

PICARD: Admiral, I have every reason to believe that they will resist

any attempt to remove them. I strongly urge you to request an emergency

session of the Federation Council. The issue of Dorvan Five must be

reopened.

NECHEYEV [on monitor]: Captain, I made that request two days ago. The

answer was no. I'm sorry but you have your orders. Starfleet out.

RIKER: So much for your reprieve from Starfleet.

PICARD: Anthwara believes that I am responsible for the crimes of one

of my ancestors against his people.

RIKER: Do you believe that?

PICARD: No, of course not. I respect his belief, but I do not see how

it can have any bearing on this mission. But even so, I can't help

wondering if a dark chapter in my family's history is about to be

repeated. If those people take up arms against us, then I cannot

foresee the consequences. Mister Worf, will you come in here for a

moment?

WORF [OC]: Aye, sir.

(Worf enters)

PICARD: Mister Worf, will you begin preparations to remove the

inhabitants from Dorvan Five.

WORF: Aye, sir.

[Habak]

(the room is smoky and Wesley is getting dizzy.

Lakanta vanishes)

[Village]

(the fire is still between Wesley and the figure)

JACK: Wesley.

WESLEY: Dad?

JACK: You've reached the end, Wesley.

WESLEY: The end of what?

JACK: This journey. The one you started a long time ago, when I left

you and your mother.

WESLEY: You mean when you died.

JACK: You set out on a journey that wasn't your own. Now it's time to

find a path that is truly yours. Don't follow me any further.

WESLEY: I don't understand.

JACK: Yes, you do. It's just hard for you to accept. Goodbye, Wesley,

and good luck.

WESLEY: Dad, wait!

[Habak]

(the fire has gone out)

[Village]

WORF: Mister Crusher. Are you all right?

WESLEY: Yeah, Worf, I'm fine.

WORF: (to security woman) Lay out a confinement beam trace along the

southeastern side of the village. Be discreet. We do not wish to alarm

these people.

SECURITY: Yes, sir.

WESLEY: Worf, what are you doing?

WORF: We are laying out transporter coordinates for a security

perimeter. It may be necessary to remove these people by force.

WESLEY: Worf, we can't do this. These people deserve better than to be

removed from their homes.

WORF: I understand, but now is not the time or the place to

WESLEY: (shouts) Do you know what they're trying to do? They're

preparing to beam you away and take you to their ship. You're not going

to let them do that, are you?

WAKASA: No, we won't. Leave now.

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: Inexcusable. You defied the orders of the

ranking officer on the scene. You put the lives of the entire away team

in jeopardy, and you made an already tense situation worse. Your

actions reflect very badly on this ship and on that uniform. Now, I

want an explanation, Mister Crusher, and I want it now.

WESLEY: What you're doing down there is wrong. These people are not

some random group of colonists. They're a unique culture with a history

that predates the Federation and Starfleet.

PICARD: That does not alter the fact that my orders are to

WESLEY: I know Admiral Necheyev gave you an order, and she was given an

order from the Federation Council. But it's still wrong.

PICARD: That decision is not yours to make, Cadet. I don't know what

has got into you lately, and frankly right now I don't care. But I will

tell you this. While you wear that uniform, you will obey every order

you're given and you will conform to Starfleet regulations and rules of

conduct. Is that clear?

WESLEY: Yes, sir, it is. But I won't be wearing this uniform any

longer. I'm resigning from the Academy.

(Wesley puts his comm. badge on the table and leaves)

RIKER [OC]: Riker to Captain.

PICARD: Go ahead, Number One.

RIKER [OC]: Gul Evek wants to meet with you to discuss the situation on

the surface.

PICARD: Let him come aboard. I'll see him in here.

RIKER [OC]: Aye, sir.

[Wesley's quarters]

(Wesley is packing his bag)

CRUSHER: Why are you doing this?

WESLEY: I told you, Starfleet isn't for me.

CRUSHER: Look, I may not be able to stop you from throwing away your

entire life, but you are going to stand here and explain it to me

first. You owe me that much.

WESLEY: I saw Dad today. He told me not to follow him.

CRUSHER: You what?

WESLEY: I was participating in an Indian ritual and I had a vision. Dad

came to me and told me not to follow him. He said I had to find my own

path.

CRUSHER: Is that what this is all about? A vision told you to leave the

Academy and now you're packing your bags?

WESLEY: No. No, it's more than that. I've known I've needed to do this

for a long time. I just haven't been able to admit it to myself.

CRUSHER: But you always said that being at the Academy was the best

thing that ever happened to you.

WESLEY: I know. For a while it was. But as time went on and graduation

got closer, I started feeling really depressed. I thought maybe it was

the workload or the stress of being away from home, but it didn't go

away. It just got worse.

CRUSHER: Why didn't you ever say anything?

WESLEY: I didn't want to disappoint you or Captain Picard or my

friends. You guys were all so proud of me.

CRUSHER: I'd be proud of you no matter what you were doing, Wesley. I

love you.

WESLEY: I know, Mom. I guess the truth is that I was afraid of

disappointing myself. I never questioned the fact that I'd be in

Starfleet. But when Dad said not to follow him, it just made so much

sense. Everything is so clear now.

CRUSHER: Maybe it is partly my fault. We didn't realised the kind of

pressure we were putting on you to be exactly what we expected you to

be

WESLEY: I don't blame you at all. It is my decision. It always has

been.

CRUSHER: You know that alien from Tau Ceti, the one who could control

warp fields with his mind?

WESLEY: The Traveller.

CRUSHER: He told Captain Picard a long time ago that you were very

special, like Mozart, and that you were destined for something quite

different from the rest of us. Maybe this is the first step. I love

you.

WESLEY: I love you too, Mom.

[Village]

WAKASA: You shouldn't be here, Wesley.

WESLEY: Why?

(the locals are taking the Cardassians prisoner)

INDIAN: Get down.

WAKASA: Bring them over here.

WORF: Why have you taken these men prisoner?

WAKASA: This is not their world. They have no right to be here.

WORF: The terms of the treaty gives them the right to survey this

planet.

WAKASA: We don't recognise that treaty.

WORF: Worf to Picard. An armed group of Indians has taken two

Cardassian prisoners. The situation is extremely volatile.

[Observation lounge]

WORF [OC]: Request instructions.

PICARD: Stand by, Mister Worf. Have your ship lock on to your people

and beam them out of there before something happens.

GUL EVEK: My people? What about these Indians of yours? They've taken

hostages. This is our planet, Captain. We will not be chased away by

some unruly crowd. Gul Evek to the Vetar.

TELAK [OC]: This is Glin Telak aboard the Vetar. Go ahead.

GUL EVEK: Two of our men on the surface have been taken prisoner.

Prepare to send an armed squad of troopers to rescue them and to occupy

the village.

PICARD: Gul Evek, those people are Federation citizens and I am sworn

to protect them. If your troops attack that village, my security forces

will respond.

GUL EVEK: I hope you realise the consequences of Federation officers

firing on Cardassian troops.

PICARD: Oh, yes, I do. That is why we must to stop this now, before

it's too late.

[Village]

WORF: I cannot allow you to hold these men as

prisoners.

WAKASA: You have no authority here.

(the fight starts with a Cardassian and Indian struggling for a weapon,

which keeps firing into the air. Then others join in. Wesley runs

forward)

WESLEY: No!

(and everything stops, including the Cardassian falling after being

shot in the chest. Lakanta walks over to Wesley, the only two still

moving)

WESLEY: What happened? Did you do this?

LAKANTA: I didn't do anything. You did.

WESLEY: I did?

LAKANTA: You pulled yourself out of their time. You took the first

step, Wesley.

WESLEY: My first step to where?

LAKANTA: To another plane of existence, another way of thinking.

WESLEY: I don't understand.

LAKANTA: You've found a new beginning for yourself. The first step on a

journey that few humans will ever take.

WESLEY: Who are you? (Lakanta transforms) The Traveller.

TRAVELLER: I've been waiting a long time for this moment, Wesley.

WESLEY: So all those things I saw in the Habak, my father, and the

things he said to me, that was your doing?

TRAVELLER: I merely opened the door for you. What you experienced came

from your own mind, your own spirit if you wish.

I hoped that you would open your mind to new possibilities, and you

did. You pulled yourself out of time, don't you see? You've evolved to

a new level you're ready to explore places where thought and energy

combine in ways you can't even imagine. And I will be your guide, if

you would like.

WESLEY: What about them? I can't just leave them like this.

TRAVELLER: They must find their own destinies, Wesley. It's not our

place to interfere.

WESLEY: But

TRAVELLER: Have faith in their abilities to solve their problems on

their own.

[Bridge]

(Red alert)

RIKER: The Cardassian ship is powering its weapons and it's

transporters.

TELAK [OC]: This is the Vetar to Gul Evek. Our troops are under attack.

They're requesting immediate assistance. What are your orders?

PICARD: Evek, the last war caused massive destruction and cost millions

of lives. Don't send our two peoples back down that same path again.

Not like this. Now the future lies in your hands right now. Give us one

last chance for peace.

TELAK [OC]: Gul Evek! What are your orders? Can we open fire?

GUL EVEK: Evek to the Vetar. Lock on to our troops on the surface and

beam them aboard.

TELAK [OC]: But, sir, they've been fired upon.

GUL EVEK: Those are my orders! Carry them out.

TELAK [OC]: Yes, sir.

PICARD: Beam up the away team immediately.

CREWMAN: Aye, sir.

GUL EVEK: I lost two of three sons in the war, Captain. I don't want to

lose the last one.

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: Anthwara, I want to make absolutely sure

that you understand the implications of this agreement. By giving up

your status as Federation citizens, any future request you or your

people make to Starfleet will go unanswered. You will be on your own

and under Cardassian jurisdiction.

ANTHWARA: I understand, Captain. And we are prepared to take that risk.

Will the Cardassian government honour your agreement here?

GUL EVEK: I believe I can convince them that this is an equitable

solution. I cannot speak for every Cardassian you may encounter, but if

you leave us alone I suspect that we will do the same. Will this be

acceptable to the Starfleet Command?

PICARD: It will not be easy, but with Admiral Necheyev's support, I

think they will go along with it in the end.

GUL EVEK: Then if there's nothing else, I will return to my ship. I

have a rather long report to write. Captain. Anthwara.

(Evek leaves)

ANTHWARA: I was right, Captain. You did not take us from our land and

you have wiped clean a very old stain of blood.

Captain's log, stardate 47755.3. The Enterprise is

preparing to leave Dorvan Five, but former cadet Wesley Crusher will be

staying behind.

[Transporter room]

PICARD: Where will you go?

WESLEY: The Traveller said that my studies would begin with these

people. He said that they're aware of many things. I can learn a lot

from them. That's just what I need. More studying.

CRUSHER: Somehow I think you'll manage.

WESLEY: Me, too.

PICARD: Well good luck, Mister. Good luck, Wesley.

WESLEY: Thank you. For a lot of things.

(Beverly and Wesley have a big hug)

CRUSHER: Now you be sure and dress warmly on those other planes of

existence.

WESLEY: I will. Bye, Mom.

CRUSHER: Goodbye.

PICARD: Energise.

  [Worf's

quarters]

(Worf is wearing his ceremonial waistcoat)

WORF: As time passes, a boy inevitably becomes a man. What is not

inevitable, is that a man become a warrior. A warrior must be forged

like a sword, tempered by, by, (thinks) tempered by experience. The

path of the warrior begins

(Alexander runs in.)

WORF: Alexander.

ALEXANDER: No! Wait!

(Worf gets soaked by a water balloon)

ERIC: Sorry. I didn't mean to hit you.

(Eric flees the scene.)

WORF: What is the meaning of this?

ALEXANDER: I'm sorry. We made fullerenes in chemistry class today and

filled them with water.

WORF: I asked you to meet me here after school. I have been waiting for

you.

ALEXANDER: I forgot.

WORF: You forgot because you allowed yourself to be distracted by

foolishness.

ALEXANDER: I'm sorry.

WORF: There is something very important I want to discuss with you. It

concerns your future. Sit. As time passes, a boy inevitably becomes a

man, but what is not inevitable is that a man become a sword

ALEXANDER: What?

WORF: No. I meant warrior. The path of A warrior begins with the First

Rite of Ascension.

ALEXANDER: Is that when they hit you with pain sticks?

WORF: No. No, that is the Second Rite.

ALEXANDER: Oh.

WORF: You are approaching the Age of Ascension. It is time for you to

prepare for the ceremony.

ALEXANDER: What do I have to do?

WORF: Well, your fighting skills will be tested and your knowledge of

the teachings of Kahless. It will be challenging, but I will help you

prepare. These are the kor'tova candles. They represent the fire that

burns within the heart of a warrior. When you light yours, you will be

declaring your intention to become a warrior. Go ahead.

ALEXANDER: What if I don't want to?

WORF: If you do not participate in the rite before the age of thirteen

years, you will never be able to become a true Klingon warrior.

ALEXANDER: Well I don't care about that.

WORF: You may not care about it now, but someday you might.

ALEXANDER: Mother always said that I didn't have to do any of this

Klingon stuff if I didn't want.

WORF: It is your decision but

ALEXANDER: Okay then. I'm not going to do it.

WORF: Alexander.

ALEXANDER: You just said it was up to me. I don't want to be a warrior.

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: As a result, we won't be able to rendezvous

with the Kearsarge for another four days.

RIKER: Will we be holding position here until it arrives?

PICARD: Yes. And, as it would seem we're in for a relatively quiet

time, I shall use this opportunity to visit the Hatarian System. There

are some ancient ruins that are just being excavated.

DATA: The delay will also make it possible for Stellar Dynamics to

complete their study of the Vodrey Nebula.

RIKER: I'll let them know they can have more access to the lateral

sensor grid.

PICARD: We could use this time to recalibrate the weapon targeting

array. Mister Worf?

WORF: (comes back from wherever) Yes, sir. I will begin the procedure

immediately.

PICARD: Very good. Dismissed. Lieutenant, could I have a word with you

for a moment?

(Riker and Data leave)

PICARD: I noticed several times during the briefing that you appeared

to be a bit distracted.

WORF: I apologise. In the future, I will make sure my personal affairs

do not interfere with my duties.

PICARD: Is everything all right?

WORF: I am having problems with Alexander. He has made it clear he does

not wish to participate in the First Rite of Ascension.

PICARD: Oh, I see.

WORF: I have tried to tell him that it is an important part of a young

Klingon's

life, but he does not understand.

PICARD: But he's had so little opportunity to spend time with Klingons.

You know, the festival of Kot'baval is tomorrow. If he could take part

in that, I'm sure he would more fully appreciate what a rich cultural

heritage he comes from. There is the Klingon outpost on Maranga Four.

I'm sure they'll be celebrating the festival.

WORF: Yes. But the outpost is on the other side of the Vodrey Nebula.

It would take three days by shuttle to get there.

PICARD: The Enterprise could be there in a fraction of the time, and

still be back in time for the rendezvous.

WORF: Captain, I cannot ask you

PICARD: Mister Worf, Stellar Dynamics would like nothing better than a

trip around the nebula.

WORF: Thank you, sir.

[Maranga Outpost]

(solid stone masonry and a joyous festival with

open air interactive opera including flailing bat'leths. Worf buys some

sweets from a woman)

LAFORGE: Who's that?

WORF: It is the tyrant Molor. He was so strong no one could stand

against him.

SINGER: Nok'tar be'got, hosh'ar te'not?

CRUSHER: What's he saying?

WORF: He is asking if anyone else will have the courage to stand up to

Molor.

SINGER: Nok'tar be'got, hosh'ar te'not?

(Worf looks round, then goes forward to take the bat'leth) WORF:

(sings) Ki'rok, Molor, ki'rok!

MOLOR: Ni'tokor bak'to! Ba'jak tu'mo!

(the mock fight begins, the blades always a good foot apart)

WORF: O'tak tu'ro!

(Worf pretends to be beaten)

WORF: Nok'tar be'got? Hosh'ar te'not?

(he stares at Alexander, who finally gets the message)

ALEXANDER: Ki'rok Molor, ki'rok!

MOLOR: What is this?

(of course, Alexander can't just pretend fight, and the blades clash)

MOLOR: Jik'ta. You have wounded me.

WORF: You fought well.

ALEXANDER: What happens now?

WORF: There is only one man can stand against Molor.

SINGER: Nok'tar Kahless.

ALEXANDER: It's Kahless!

WORF: Kahless would rather die than live under Molor's tyranny.

ALEXANDER: Ni'lot Kahless!

[Maranga Outpost]

(night, and Worf is waiting for Alexander, who

comes running)

ALEXANDER: Father.

WORF: Where have you been?

ALEXANDER: We were watching the fire dancers.

WORF: We?

ALEXANDER: K'Nor and Bar'el. They live here on the outpost. I need some

money.

WORF: What for?

ALEXANDER: The man over there says he's got Molor's head in a box. The

real Molor.

WORF: That is impossible. The real Molor died centuries ago.

ALEXANDER: I know. It's mummified. He offered to show us for fifty

darseks.

WORF: He is trying to take your money.

ALEXANDER: Please, Father. He's waiting.

WORF: No. It is late. We should go home.

ALEXANDER: But

(they are watched by a mysterious stranger)

WORF: Alexander, that is enough. Come, it is time to go.

ALEXANDER: I have to say goodbye to my friends.

WORF: You can see your friends again tomorrow.

ALEXANDER: We're coming back?

WORF: If you want to.

(three Klingons surround them and draw their daggers)

ROBBER: Hi'jak beh.

(the mysterious stranger fires a disrupter and startles the attackers)

WORF: Run, Alexander.

(Worf takes on the three robbers, and the stranger only intervenes to

stop one getting knife to stab him in the back)

K'MTAR: Ni'tokor bak'to!

(the robbers run off)

K'MTAR: Q'apla, Worf. You are too much for them.

WORF: I have seen you before. Who are you?

K'MTAR: A friend.

(he holds out his fist, displaying a ring)

WORF: Are you K'mtar.

K'MTAR: Your brother sent me here to protect you.

[Observation lounge]

WORF: He is gin'tak to the house of Mogh.

RIKER: Gin'tak?

WORF: An advisor so trusted that he is become part of a family.

RIKER: Do you have any idea who was behind the attack?

K'MTAR: It is a Klingon matter. It is not your concern.

RIKER: One of my officers was almost killed. That makes it my concern.

K'MTAR: Recently, rumours began to circulate on the homeworld that an

assassination attempt was going to be made on the family of Mogh. Kurn

sent me here to make sure nothing happened to Worf.

RIKER: Why didn't you warn him before the attack was made?

K'MTAR: I tried to contact him over subspace. I was told he was not

aboard. I decided to beam directly to the surface.

RIKER: Why didn't you let us know about it?

K'MTAR: Forgive me for being blunt, Commander, but when it comes to

protecting the house to which I have pledged my life, I trust no one.

WORF: I have full confidence in the officers with whom I serve. One of

the attackers dropped this dagger. The design represents the house of

Duras.

K'MTAR: We have other evidence that indicates the Duras sisters, Lursa

and B'Etor, were behind the attack.

RIKER: What do you think they were after?

K'MTAR: Kurn's seat on the Council, of course.

WORF: We can not allow their attack on our house to go unanswered.

K'MTAR: First, we must to find them.

RIKER: At one point they were at Deep Space Nine, trying to sell

bilitrium explosives.

K'MTAR: That was months ago. No one knows where they went from there.

RIKER: Maybe we can find them. We've arranged for quarters on the ship,

if you'd like to stay.

K'MTAR: I would. Worf and I have much to discuss.

[Worf's quarters]

K'MTAR: I will send Kurn a message telling him what

happened, but he will not receive

it for days. He's gone to the Hitora colony

WORF: Why did you treat Commander Riker so disrespectfully? You were

rude.

K'MTAR: I may have been rude by human standards. I meant no disrespect.

What is the matter, Worf? Have you been living so long among humans

that you have forgotten how Klingons behave?

WORF: I have not forgotten. I am merely stating that their ways our

different than ours.

K'MTAR: I trust you have made your son aware of that fact as well.

WORF: Yes, of course I have.

K'MTAR: Good. Because someday Alexander may be called upon to lead the

house of Mogh. Kurn has no male heir. He wants to make sure that

Alexander is preparing himself.

WORF: Does my brother doubt my ability to raise my son as a Klingon?

K'MTAR: No. But you are alone among humans. It cannot be easy to keep

our ways.

WORF: No. It has not been easy.

K'MTAR: How are his fighting skills? Can he handle a bat'leth?

WORF: He is learning. He could be better.

K'MTAR: He must. He's nearing the age of ascension.

WORF: Actually, Alexander has not yet committed himself to undergoing

the Rite.

K'MTAR: What?

WORF: I have tried to explain to him how important it is, but he will

not listen to me.

K'MTAR: Perhaps together, you and I can find a way to spark the boy's

interest in his heritage.

WORF: I would be grateful for any help you could offer.

K'MTAR: Tomorrow, then.

WORF: Tomorrow.

K'MTAR: May I say goodnight to the boy?

WORF: Yes, of course.

[Alexander's room]

(there's a picture by the bed)

K'MTAR: Is this your mother?

ALEXANDER: Yes. She died when I was little.

K'MTAR: You miss her a great deal, don't you? It must be hard for you,

being the only Klingon your age aboard this ship.

ALEXANDER: Sometimes.

K'MTAR: Have you ever been to the Homeworld?

ALEXANDER: No.

K'MTAR: I think you would like it there. At your uncle's house there is

a lake you can swim in that is so clear you can see all the way to the

bottom.

ALEXANDER: Really?

K'MTAR: You have cousins there. They want to meet you.

ALEXANDER: I don't know.

K'MTAR: I understand. You're afraid. You don't whether the Homeworld is

safe.

ALEXANDER: Yes.

K'MTAR: What happened today on the planet is frightening. You're still

troubled.

ALEXANDER: I thought they were going to kill my father.

K'MTAR: You must have wanted to help us fight them off.

ALEXANDER: I didn't know what to do.

K'MTAR: Someday, if you work hard, you will become a warrior. A Klingon

warrior. And you will always feel safe because you will know how to

defend yourself. And I'll tell you something else. If anyone ever tries

to hurt your father again, you will be able to fight at his side and

make sure nothing happens to him. What do you think of that? Goodnight,

Alexander. Dream well.

ALEXANDER: Good night, K'mtar.

[Bridge]

(at the Science station)

RIKER: Any luck?

DATA: Starfleet records contain no mention of the Duras sisters after

their departure from Deep Space Nine.

K'MTAR: Did I not tell you as much?

RIKER: Have you been able to contact Deep Space Nine?

WORF: I am being patched through right now, sir.

RIKER: On screen. Quark. I see you remember me.

QUARK [on viewscreen]: How could I forget the only man ever to win

triple down dabo at one of my tables?

RIKER: And how could I forget that you didn't have enough latinum to

cover my winnings?

QUARK [on viewscreen]: I thought I explained that my brother had

misplaced the key to the safe. Besides, those vouchers I gave you are

every bit as good as latinum.

RIKER: Not exactly. You can spend latinum just about anywhere. Those

vouchers are only good at your bar.

QUARK [on viewscreen]: Is that what this is about? You're on your way

and you're calling to reserve a holosuite programme?

RIKER: Actually, I was hoping you could help me with something else.

QUARK [on viewscreen]: What would that be?

RIKER: I'm looking for some Klingon friends of mine. The Duras sisters,

Lursa and B'Etor?

QUARK [on viewscreen]: Yes, Lursa and B'Etor. Big talk, small tips.

RIKER: Do you know where I can find them?

QUARK [on viewscreen]: Well, I did hear a rumour, actually.

RIKER: What kind of rumour?

QUARK [on viewscreen]: Oh, I don't know. I'm sure it was told to me in

confidence.

RIKER: And how much would your confidence cost?

QUARK [on viewscreen]: How many vouchers do you have, again?

RIKER: I have enough for twelve bars of latinum. I'd be glad to return

them.

QUARK [on viewscreen]: I believe the rumour was that the sisters were

trying to buy some second hand mining equipment.

RIKER: What for?

QUARK [on viewscreen]: They learned of a magnesite deposit on the Kalla

system. It belongs to the Pakleds, but those fools don't even know it's

there. Your, er, friends tried to get at it.

RIKER: All right. I'll send those vouchers to you.

QUARK [on viewscreen]: Don't bother. I voided them while we've been

talking.

RIKER: So long, Quark.

(transmission ends)

RIKER: How long would it take us to get to the Kalla system?

WORF: Approximately sixteen hours, sir.

K'MTAR: Could not he have been lying?

RIKER: Why would he? I'd just be knocking on his door again in a few

days, and I wouldn't be in as good a mood.

K'MTAR: Congratulations, Commander. I did not think it would be

possible to find the sisters.

RIKER: Take us out of orbit.

HELM: Aye, sir.

[Outside the holodeck]

(Alexander and Worf are in exercise clothes, and

Alexander has a bat'leth)

K'MTAR: I took the liberty of creating a holodeck programme.

WORF: What kind of programme?

K'MTAR: I'll show you. Computer, run programme K'mtar alpha one.

COMPUTER: Programme initiated. Enter when ready.

[Holodeck - Maranga Outpost]

ALEXANDER: Why did you want to recreate this?

K'MTAR: You said you wished you had been able to help your father

fight, but you did not know how. You have probably fought that battle

over and over again in your mind.

ALEXANDER: Yes.

K'MTAR: Let's see what happens now.

(He gives Worf a dagger)

K'MTAR: Computer, give me two Klingon warriors.

ALEXANDER: How can I fight someone that big?

K'MTAR: Size is not the most important thing. Skill, cunning, powers of

observation are the most important weapons. Ni'tokor bak'to!

(Worf defeats his man easily while Alexander holds a dagger at bay with

his bat'leth)

K'MTAR: Freeze programme. Look what this ko'tal is doing. You see his

leg? That will give a clue as to what his next move will be.

ALEXANDER: All his weight is on his right foot.

WORF: Yes, he is going to have to shift it to regain his balance.

K'MTAR: Stand ready. Computer, resume programme.

(Alexander knocks the klingon down)

K'MTAR: Po'tajg! Po'tajg! Finish him.

(Alexander drops his bat'leth and walks away. The klingon gets up to

kill him instead)

K'MTAR: Freeze programme. You should have killed him when you had the

chance.

WORF: Why did you not?

ALEXANDER: I don't know.

K'MTAR: Look at him! He did not care that you showed him mercy. He was

going to kill you.

WORF: K'mtar, that is enough.

K'MTAR: If this was real, he'd be dead by now.

(Alexander runs out of the holodeck)

WORF: Alexander.

[Bridge]

DATA: We are approaching Kalla Three.

RIKER: Set a standard orbit. Any evidence of a mining expedition?

WORF: A shaft has been cut through the outer crust. There is evidence

of machinery, but it does not appear to be in use.

RIKER: Life signs?

DATA: It is difficult to say. The magnesite is interfering with

bioreadings.

RIKER: Assemble an away team.

[Mine]

LAFORGE: Who are you?

GORTA: Gorta. I am Gorta.

WORF: What are you doing on this planet?

GORTA: I crashed here.

DATA: Then you are denying involvement in illegal mining activities?

GORTA: Mining? So that's what all this equipment is here for.

WORF: We are looking for two Klingon women. Sisters.

GORTA: Lursa? B'Etor? Do you know where they are?

LAFORGE: Actually we were hoping that you did.

GORTA: Maybe I do.

DATA: Would you be willing to share your information with us?

GORTA: My personal code of conduct prohibits sharing. But I'd consider

a trade.

LAFORGE: Does your personal code of conduct tell you that when you're

stranded on a planet with no way off, you shouldn't try to cut deals?

GORTA: You have a point.

DATA: We could certainly provide passage off this planet in exchange

for information.

GORTA: Could you perhaps fail to tell the Pakleds that we were mining

their ore?

LAFORGE: Don't push your luck. But if you get us to the Duras sisters,

I'll see what I can do.

GORTA: The Duras sisters. They are magnificent, aren't they?

WORF: Where are they now?

GORTA: Selling the ore, I imagine. They took everything. The ore, the

ship.

WORF: And where have they gone?

GORTA: We were going to sell the ore to a Yridian trader. We were

supposed to meet him in the Ufandi system.

DATA: Gather your belongings. It is time to leave.

GORTA: Like I said, they took everything.

[Ten Forward]

K'MTAR: Worf. I am sorry about what happened. I

should not have gotten so angry. It's just that I am worried about

Alexander.

WORF: As am I.

K'MTAR: Kurn told me that his mother actively discouraged him exploring

his Klingon heritage.

WORF: When he first came to live with me, he knew nothing of our ways.

He often reminds me of things his mother said to him. I try not to

disregard her wishes, I want the boy to honour his mother.

K'MTAR: Someday I'm sure he will appreciate you and be grateful for all

that you have given him. But still, compared to other boys his age, his

fighting skills are years behind.

WORF: Yes, I know. He does not put in the time it takes to learn the

skills.

K'MTAR: I thought that you might consider sending him to the training

Academy on Ogat. Your brother is an influential man. I'm sure he could

see to it that Alexander was admitted.

WORF: Ogat?

K'MTAR: I am only thinking of what is best for the boy. There, he would

learn our ways. He would live like a Klingon.

WORF: I would like him to learn our ways. No. This is his home.

K'MTAR: How can you expect him to lead our family when all he knows is

life aboard a Federation starship?

WORF: He is my son. He belongs with me.

K'MTAR: The boy is more human than Klingon. If he stays here, he will

never be a warrior. He will never be able to defend our family against

its enemies.

WORF: Enough! Enough! Enough! The decision is mine.

K'MTAR: Not necessarily. I would be well within my rights to invoke

ya'nora kor.

WORF: You would question my fitness to raise my own son?

K'MTAR: For the good of our house, yes. Worf, I beg of you. Please stop

thinking of yourself. It is Alexander we should be considering. Look

into your heart and do what is best for him.

[Worf's quarters]

K'MTAR: Kahless was determined to teach his brother

a lesson because he had told a lie.

But Morath refused to fight him and instead ran away. Kahless pursued

him across the valleys, over the mountains, and down to the edge of the

sea. And there on the shore, they fought for

ALEXANDER: Twelve days, twelve nights. I know, I've heard this story

before.

K'MTAR: Alexander, it is important to tell these stories, even if we

already know them.

ALEXANDER: Why was Kahless so mad about the lie his brother told?

K'MTAR: It made him look like a coward.

ALEXANDER: If Kahless would have just explained what happened, maybe

they wouldn't have had to fight about it.

K'MTAR: You're missing the point.

ALEXANDER: Why was it so wrong for Morath to run away? Maybe he didn't

want to fight his brother because he didn't want to have to kill him.

K'MTAR: He ran because he was a coward.

ALEXANDER: But how do you know that's why?

K'MTAR: No more questions! These are our stories. It is important for a

warrior to learn how to interpret them properly.

ALEXANDER: I'm trying to

K'MTAR: No, your head is filled with foolish human notions about the

way things are. You are Klingon. It is time you began to act like one.

ALEXANDER: I am part human, too.

K'MTAR: Listen to me, Alexander. When a human looks at you, he does not

see himself. He sees a Klingon.

ALEXANDER: It doesn't matter what I look like.

K'MTAR: It does. You are different than everyone else aboard this ship.

ALEXANDER: That's not true.

K'MTAR: It is. The only way that you will ever feel as if you truly

belong, is to leave here and go live with your own kind. I know a

Klingon school you could go to. You would be welcome there. They would

teach you how to be a warrior, prepare you for the Rite of Ascension.

ALEXANDER: I don't know if I want to do that.

K'MTAR: After you were there a while you would find that you wouldn't

want to do anything else.

ALEXANDER: I don't want to leave the Enterprise.

K'MTAR: Alexander, you must. Everything depends on it.

ALEXANDER: I thought you were different. I thought you understood me.

But you don't. You're just like my Father. All you care about is me

becoming a warrior. Just leave me alone!

First Officer's log, stardate 47779.4. We've

entered the Ufandi system, where we believe the Duras sisters might

have come to sell the ore they mined on Kalla Three.

[Bridge]

DATA: I am detecting a vessel holding position near

the third planet. It is a Yridian freighter.

RIKER: Put it on screen. Scan for magnesite in its hold.

DATA: The resonance signature indicates that there is magnesite ore

present.

RIKER: Then we're too late. The sisters have already been here.

TROI: Somehow I doubt the Yridians are going to be forthcoming about

where they might have gone.

DATA: Sir, readings indicate that there are only five hundred kilograms

of ore in the Yridian hold.

WORF: There should be over ten thousand kilograms.

RIKER: That's odd. Hail them. I'm Commander William Riker from the

Federation Starship Enterprise.

YOG [on viewscreen]: I am Yog. Why are we speaking?

RIKER: Our sensors indicate that you're carrying magnesite ore.

YOG [on viewscreen]: Magnesite, yes.

RIKER: Where did you get it?

YOG [on viewscreen]: From a Corvallen. For a good price.

RIKER: Where is this Corvallen now? I'm under orders to acquire some

magnesite.

YOG [on viewscreen]: He is gone. Where? Who is to know?

RIKER: Would you be interested in selling me the ore you're carrying?

YOG [on viewscreen]: No, I have a buyer.

RIKER: You haven't heard my offer. Half a gram of Anjoran biomimetic

gel.

YOG [on viewscreen]: Done.

RIKER: Once we verify the purity of your ore, we'll beam over the gel.

(transmission ends)

TROI: You're up to something.

RIKER: Have the transporter room beam the ore to these coordinates.

DATA: Sir, that would place the ore directly off the ship's starboard

bow.

RIKER: I know.

WORF: Transport complete.

RIKER: Lock phasers on the ore and fire.

WORF: Firing.

(the explosion reveals the outline of)

WORF: A Klingon bird of prey.

RIKER: Put a tractor beam on it.

TROI: How did you know?

RIKER: The Yridians had only part of the shipment in their hold. I

realised we had arrived before they had completed the transfer.

WORF: The Klingon ship is hailing us.

RIKER: On screen.

LURSA [on viewscreen]: Release our vessel at once!

RIKER: I don't think so.

B'ETOR [on viewscreen]: We've done nothing wrong. We were engaging in a

simple business transaction.

RIKER: We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I want to talk about

the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf.

B'ETOR [on viewscreen]: What assassination attempt? This is the first

I've heard of it.

LURSA [on viewscreen]: Too bad it didn't succeed.

RIKER: We have evidence that you're behind it.

LURSA [on viewscreen]: That is outrageous.

B'ETOR [on viewscreen]: What is this evidence?

RIKER: Beam over. We'll show you.

B'ETOR [on viewscreen]: We'll be there. Shortly.

[Observation lounge]

WORF: This was dropped by one of the assassins. It

bears the crest of your house.

B'ETOR: Ge'ko kaf'la.

LURSA: Someone must have given it to the assassins to implicate us.

TROI: Why would someone do that?

B'ETOR: In order to tarnish our good name.

WORF: You cannot tarnish a rusted blade.

LURSA: Ji'ko to'val!

WORF: Gir'nak tovo'sor!

RIKER: Mister Worf. You said there was other evidence they were

involved.

K'MTAR: Yes. On the Homeworld.

RIKER: We'll set a course. I want this thing cleared up.

K'MTAR: I will send a message to Kurn. He may wish to return to the

Homeworld as well.

(K'mtar leaves)

B'ETOR: Bet'ala nog'tor.

LURSA: Impossible.

TROI: What is it?

B'ETOR: These markings represent the members of our house. This symbol

represents our father, myself, my sister. And this represents her son.

WORF: I was not aware you had a son.

LURSA: I do not. But I am with child.

B'ETOR: She found out only a few days ago and told no one but me. How

can this marking be here? Where did this come from?

WORF: I will speak with K'mtar.

[Worf's quarters]

(Worf enters to find K'mtar with a weapon aimed at

Alexander. He pulls him to the floor and is about to hit him when)

K'MTAR: Father. Stop, I am your son. I am Alexander.

WORF: What are you saying?

K'MTAR: I am your son Alexander. I have come to this time from forty

years in the future.

WORF: P'tak! Tell me the truth or I will kill you.

K'MTAR: Look at me. When we first met you said I looked familiar.

WORF: I could have seen you on the Homeworld.

K'MTAR: No. Look closely. I am your son.

WORF: If you are Alexander, you will remember your mother's last words

before she died.

K'MTAR: I was three years old. She was dying when we found her. She

barely managed to whisper my name and then she took my hand and placed

it in yours. Then she died. And then you howled in rage and said, look

upon her. Look upon death and always to remember. And I always have.

(Worf stops strangling him)

WORF: How have you done this, come to this time?

K'MTAR: I met a man in the Cambra system. He gave me a chance to change

the past. He had the ability to send me here, to this time.

WORF: And you came here in order to end your own life?

K'MTAR: I was hoping that I would not have to, that I could change

things, that I could change myself. But I could not. And now everything

is going to turn out like it did before. I cannot let that happen.

WORF: But why? What is going to happen that is so terrible?

K'MTAR: You will be killed because I was naive, too weak to be able to

protect you.

WORF: I do not believe that.

K'MTAR: I was there! I saw you murdered. I was to blame.

WORF: You must not blame yourself.

K'MTAR: You don't understand. I did not become a warrior. I was a

diplomat, a peacemaker. When it came my time to lead our family, I

thought that I could single handedly end the fighting between the great

houses. I publicly announced that the house of Mogh would be the first

to end the feuding. That there would be no more retribution, no more

revenge. You tried to warn me. You tried to tell me that I should not

show weakness, but I thought you were a foolish old man. I told you

that you were a relic from an earlier time and that a new era of peace

was at hand. But you were right. My enemies saw my weakness and moved

against me. And unless I stop it right now, that boy will see his

father

killed on the floor of the Council Chamber.

WORF: That is why you wanted to take Alexander away. To turn him into a

warrior.

K'MTAR: I staged the assassination attempt to try and frighten him, to

make him realise that he must follow the ways of the warrior. If I had

listened to you, if I had become the warrior that you had wanted me to

be, you would not have died in my arms.

WORF: No. Who knows what the future will be now that you have disrupted

time? I may die tomorrow or I may outlive you. But when I die, I would

like an honourable death. And the only way that is possible is for you

accept yourself as you are, and stay true to what you believe. The

cause of peace is a just cause. The struggle must continue.

K'MTAR: It is a futile struggle. I cannot change things.

WORF: You have already changed things more than you realise.

K'MTAR: The boy I was has not changed.

WORF: But I have. You have given me a glimpse into my son's future and

I know now that he has his own destiny. And I believe it will be a

great one.

K'MTAR: I love you, Father.

WORF: And I you, Alexander.

[Holodeck - Maranga Outpost]

(Alexander is practising with his bat'leth)

ALEXANDER: I've been waiting. Where's K'mtar?

WORF: He had to leave. He was called away.

ALEXANDER: He never said goodbye.

WORF: He asked me to say goodbye for him. He also wanted me to tell

you, no matter what happens, no matter what you decide to do with your

life, he will always care for you a great deal.

ALEXANDER: When will I see him again?

WORF: It may be a long time.

ALEXANDER: Well, we should start practice.

WORF: Alexander. There will be plenty of time for training.

Stardate:

47829.1

Original Airdate: 2 May, 1994

  [Bridge]

PICARD: Report.

RIKER: There's an object of some kind closing in on our position.

PICARD: On screen.

DATA: It appears to be an unmanned probe approximately one half metre

in diameter. There are no identifiable armaments.

WORF: Captain, we are being, You are being hailed, by name.

PICARD: Open a channel. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard

WORF: Captain, I am reading a power surge.

RIKER: Shields up.

DATA: The beam appears to contain holographic imaging information.

RIKER: It's trying to project something.

PICARD: Isolate the bandwidth. Let the signal through the shields.

(the image of a Ferengi appears)

PICARD: Bok!

BOK: I trust you remember me, Picard, because I haven't forgotten you

or how you murdered my son. For fifteen years now I've thought about

how to avenge his death but nothing I could do to you could equal what

you did to me, until now. You thought you could hide him from me,

didn't you? But I found out about him. Jason Vigo is as good as dead.

I'm going to kill your son, Picard, just like you killed mine.

(hologram ends)

PICARD: Mister Worf, put a tractor beam on that probe. Determine if

it's safe to beam it aboard. I want to know where it came from. Mister

Data, see if there is any mention of a Jason Vigo in Federation

records. You might start with Miranda Vigo. She was born on New Gaul

about fifty years ago.

DATA: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Number One, contact the Ferengi Government. Find out all you

can about Bok. He was wearing a DaiMon's uniform. If he's regained his

rank, I want to know why.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come.

RIKER: The Ferengi Government is debating an amendment to the Rules of

Acquisition. It could be a while before we hear from them. Data found

out that the woman you mentioned has a son named Jason. This is the

most recent picture we could find.

PICARD: How old is the boy now?

RIKER: Twenty three. He and his mother left Earth twelve years ago.

They settled on Camor Five. That's all we know. The planet's records

are virtually non-existent.

PICARD: Picard to Bridge. Set a course for the Camor system, warp five.

HELM [OC]: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Will, I do appreciate your not asking, but I do think that you

have a right to know. There is a possibility that the boy is my son. I

was involved with his mother for a short time about twenty four years

ago. We met through a friend when I was on shore leave on Earth. It was

all very romantic, very intense, probably because we both knew I would

be leaving in two weeks. And we kept in touch for a while, but we never

managed to get together again.

RIKER: She never said anything to you about being pregnant?

PICARD: No, so either Bok is wrong and I'm not the father, or Miranda

decided to raise the child alone, which quite frankly wouldn't surprise

me. She was very independent, very strong willed.

RIKER: She would have to be to get by on Camor Five.

PICARD: But whether he's my son or not, he's in danger. Bok tried to

kill me six years ago, and I don't doubt he will try to make good his

threat against the boy.

[Bridge]

(at the science station)

RIKER: Anything?

WORF: There are no Ferengi vessels within range of our scanners.

DATA: Captain, I am unable to find any information on Jason Vigo's

current whereabouts.

PICARD: What about his mother?

DATA: No, sir.

PICARD: Miranda was trained as a botanist. She always used to talk

about running a farm one day. Maybe we should concentrate on the

agricultural areas.

DATA: That would significantly narrow our search. The only cultivated

land is on the southern continent, and there are relatively few people

engaged in agricultural activities.

PICARD: There cannot be many non-Camorites among them. Scan for human

life signs.

DATA: I am detecting eight humans. Three are female. However, they are

all too young to be Miranda Vigo.

PICARD: What about males?

DATA: One is an infant. Another is elderly. Two are middle aged.

PICARD: That's seven. You said there were eight.

DATA: I am having difficulty getting a clear reading on the eighth. The

individual appears to be approximately two kilometres beneath the

planet's surface.

PICARD: Male or female?

DATA: Male, between twenty and thirty years old.

RIKER: No one in their right mind would go that far underground alone.

PICARD: Unless he were forced to.

WORF: Captain, I am reading seismic instability in the area. He is in

danger.

PICARD: Relay his coordinates to the transporter room. Have them beam

him aboard.

DATA: Aye, sir.

[Transporter room]

(A young man in the act of rock climbing nearly

falls over)

JASON: What the? This is a Federation ship.

PICARD: That's right. I'm Captain Picard. Jean-Luc Picard.

JASON: I realise I wasn't supposed to be spelunking that cave, but

don't you have something better to do?

PICARD: We thought you were at risk.

JASON: Oh. Well, I wasn't, so maybe you should just beam me back where

I was?

PICARD: Are you Jason Vigo?

JASON: I, er, I know him. Is he in trouble?

PICARD: In a manner of speaking. Someone has made a threat against his

life. Jason, I'm an old friend of your mother's. I'm here because

you're in danger.

JASON: Why would anybody want to kill me?

PICARD: The person who has made the threat is under the impression that

you are my son.

JASON: Am I?

PICARD: I don't know.

JASON: My mother never told me who my father was. Just that he was in

Starfleet.

PICARD: Maybe we should contact her.

JASON: She died a few years ago.

PICARD: Oh, I'm sorry. Jason, I think it's important that we find out

one way or another. Would you be willing to permit a genetic test?

JASON: If I'm not your son, is this person still going to want to kill

me?

PICARD: I doubt it.

JASON: In that case, you won't mind my saying that I hope you're not my

father.

[Sickbay]

(Crusher draws a blood sample)

PICARD: What were you doing in the caves, Jason? Are you a

seismologist?

JASON: No, I just enjoy climbing.

PICARD: Without an antigrav harness?

JASON: No, they get in the way.

PICARD: So, what do you do?

JASON: I'm between jobs right now.

PICARD: I see.

CRUSHER: Excuse me, gentlemen, the test results are ready if you'd like

to hear them. Your genetic code is a cross between the DNA of your

mother, Miranda Vigo, and your father Jean-Luc Picard.

[Picard's quarters]

JASON: What's all this?

PICARD: Oh, theses are archaeological fragments that I've collected

over the years. This is a Silvan glyph stone. And

this, this is a Gorlan prayer stick. It's really quite rare.

JASON: Is it valuable?

PICARD: Not really. Only to students of archaeology such as myself.

Though I did have to hand over a bottle of very old Saurian brandy for

it.

JASON: I'd say you got taken.

PICARD: Perhaps, but it's of value to me nonetheless.

JASON: On Camor, something has value if you can eat it or sell it.

Everything else is luxury.

PICARD: Would you like some tea?

JASON: No. Thanks.

PICARD: Something else?

JASON: No.

PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot. I'm sure this whole thing is as much a

surprise to you as it is to me. I really want to be honest with you,

Jason. I only knew your mother for a very short time. I would have

liked to have known her better. It just didn't work out that way. You

look a lot like her, you know. It's the eyes, I think. I would like to

make one thing clear, Jason. Your mother never told me about you. If

she had, I would have been part of your life.

JASON: Maybe that's not what she wanted. I think I'd like to go back to

the surface now.

PICARD: I think it would be better if you stayed on board the

Enterprise until we have resolved this situation with Bok.

JASON: What is the situation with Bok, anyway? Why does he want me

dead?

PICARD: Years ago, I was forced to destroy a starship commanded by his

son. Bok apparently feels that it would be fitting vengeance to kill my

son.

JASON: I can't hide forever.

PICARD: Of course not. We are trying to locate Bok now. I want to

confront him, settle this matter.

JASON: How long is this going to take?

PICARD: I assure you there is no one more eager to put this behind us

than I am.

JASON: Where do I stay?

PICARD: We'll get you some quarters.

JASON: Okay. Let's go.

PICARD: Jason. Your being here? I hope it will give us the chance to

get to know each other.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: We managed to shut down the probe's power

systems so we could beam it aboard. It's not going to be easy to figure

out where this thing came from.

DATA: Bok took the precaution of encrypting the probe's navigational

systems so that we would be unable to decipher its flight path.

LAFORGE: We ran an analysis of the probe's hull. From the energy

signatures and particle deposits we found, it looks like it travelled

through a dichromic nebula, was exposed to an intensive gravimetric

distortion, and passed within one light year of a class four pulsar.

DATA: Those phenomena are relatively common. We would need to identify

at least one of them specifically in order to postulate a flight path.

PICARD: Understood.

DATA: Captain, incoming message from DaiMon Birta.

PICARD: Put it on screen. Thank you for taking the time to talk to us,

DaiMon.

BIRTA [on viewscreen]: I understand you have a problem.

PICARD: Yes, it concerns DaiMon Bok.

BIRTA [on viewscreen]: Bok is no DaiMon. He was relieved of command six

years ago. He was unstable, dangerous. We had to confine him to Rog

Prison.

PICARD: But he's no longer there?

BIRTA [on viewscreen]: He was able to buy himself out about two years

ago.

PICARD: I see. Do you know his whereabouts now?

BIRTA [on viewscreen]: I understand he was seen in the Dorias cluster

not too long ago.

PICARD: But that cluster consists of more than twenty star systems.

BIRTA [on viewscreen]: You don't have to thank me, Captain.

(transmission ends)

LAFORGE: Believe it or not, Captain, that might've given us the fix we

needed. There's a nebula in the Dorias cluster that matches the same

particle signature we found on the probe.

DATA: There is a class four pulsar three light years from the nebula.

My calculations indicate the probe was launched in the Xendi Kabu

system.

PICARD: Plot a course. Take us out of orbit.

[Crusher's office]

CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, come in.

PICARD: I think I need to talk to a parent.

CRUSHER: So, what's he like?

PICARD: I'm not sure that I can tell you. He puts up so many barriers I

have no idea what's underneath.

CRUSHER: Keep in mind he's had twenty years to be angry that his father

wasn't there. It's going to take some time to get over those feelings.

But I do think it's possible.

PICARD: Perhaps. But surely it would be wrong to force the issue. My

sense is that he's a very independent young man. Perhaps it would be

best if I left him alone. Let him come to me if he wants to.

CRUSHER: Maybe you're right. But I think you should consider this. Are

you doing the best thing for Jason or what's easiest for you?

[Jason's quarters]

(doorbell)

JASON: Yeah?

TROI: Hello, Jason. I'm Deanna Troi, Ship's Counsellor.

JASON: Come in. Did Captain Picard ask you to come talk to me?

TROI: No, I just thought I'd come and see how you were doing. A lot's

happened in the last few hours. I thought you might like to talk about

it.

JASON: I'll be all right. People have wanted to kill me before.

TROI: But you've never met your father before.

JASON: And I have to admit I never thought I would.

TROI: It must be somewhat overwhelming.

JASON: I'm a little shaky.

TROI: Well, that's only natural.

JASON: But you know what? I feel better already just talking to you.

TROI: So, how did you feel about the Captain, about your father?

JASON: He's okay. A little stiff. But where are you from?

TROI: I was born on Betazed.

JASON: Do all the women there have eyes like yours?

TROI: Look Jason, I came here to talk to you because I'm the Ship's

Counsellor. If you don't want to talk to me in that way, then I think I

should go.

JASON: Fine.

TROI: You're welcome to make an appointment to come by my office.

JASON: Maybe I'll do just that.

[Picard's quarters]

(Picard is sleeping)

BOK: Picard, can you hear me?

(Picard wakes to see Bok at the foot of his bed)

BOK: I will kill him, Picard. And there's nothing you can do about it.

PICARD: Security to Captain's quarters immediately.

(but Bok has vanished)

[Engineering]

WORF: Our shields were up. How could he have beamed

through them?

LAFORGE: I'm not sure he did. Sensors don't show any sign of an

intruder.

PICARD: Could it have been another hologram?

LAFORGE: I don't think so, Captain. Something has to generate a

hologram. We would have detected it.

PICARD: Bok once used a mind control device to make me hallucinate.

LAFORGE: That device emitted a very specific energy signature. I'm not

reading anything like that.

WORF: Could he have modified the device so he could use it without

being detected?

LAFORGE: It's possible. I'll recalibrate the sensors to scan for low

intensity transmissions. Just to be sure, I'll sweep your quarters with

a resonance scanner.

PICARD: Good. Keep me posted.

(La Forge leaves)

PICARD: Mister Worf, I want you to assign a security detail to Jason.

WORF: And what about yourself?

PICARD: I am not the target of Bok's threats. Jason is.

DATA: Captain, I have compiled all available records pertaining to

Jason Vigo's criminal record, and

PICARD: Criminal record?

DATA: Yes, sir. He has been charged three times with petty theft, twice

for disorderly conduct, and several dozen times for trespassing.

PICARD: Trespassing?

DATA: I believe the charges relate to his climbing activities in the

caves underneath the planet's surface. This is the information you

requested, is it not?

PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data.

[Ten Forward]

(Jason is being shadowed by male and female

security)

JASON: What was your name again?

RHODES: Lieutenant Rhodes.

JASON: Actually, I meant your first name.

RHODES: Sandra.

JASON: Well, Sandra, do you think you could give me some room?

RHODES: We're supposed to be keeping an eye on you.

JASON: Can't you can keep an eye on me from over there?

(Security moves away. Jason's hand starts to shake so he puts his drink

down)

PICARD: Good morning.

JASON: I thought you said your ship was the safest place I could be.

Why the guards?

PICARD: Because Bok appeared in my quarters last night. Now, it might

not have been him. It may have been an image. We're investigating.

JASON: Look, why don't you just drop me off somewhere. I can watch out

for myself.

PICARD: That wouldn't be wise.

JASON: I've been doing it since I was fifteen.

PICARD: I'm sure you have, but Bok is a dangerous creature. He has a

starship, he has technology.

JASON: All right, all right. I'll stay here.

PICARD: You seem to like rock climbing. The holodeck can create some

very challenging climbs. We could go down together and I could show you

how to use the

programme.

JASON: Thanks, but I think I can figure it out myself.

PICARD: Perhaps we could climb together. I'm probably not as skilled as

you, but I'm not inexperienced.

JASON: Look, I'm sorry. I appreciate what you're trying to do. But

Captain. Captain, father, Jean-Luc, I don't know what I'm supposed to

call you. As soon as this thing with Bok is over, I'm leaving. So don't

you see? There really isn't any point in our getting acquainted. Let me

know as soon as you catch him, all right?

Captain's log, stardate 47829.1. We've been in the

Xendi Kabu system for over three hours, and still no sign of Bok.

[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, I am detecting an object five

thousand kilometres off our starboard bow. It is another probe.

PICARD: Why didn't we detect it before?

WORF: It must have been cloaked, sir. It came out of nowhere.

PICARD: On screen. Is it another holographic device?

DATA: I do not believe so, sir.

WORF: Captain, the probe's systems are overloading.

RIKER: Red alert. Shields up!

(KaBOOM then a series of flashes)

RIKER: Damage report.

WORF: No damage, sir.

DATA: Captain, I do not believe it was meant as an attack, but rather

as a message.

PICARD: A message?

DATA: Yes, sir, in B'zal, a Ferengi code which uses an alternating

pattern of light and darkness.

PICARD: Can you translate it?

DATA: I am attempting to do so. The message reads, my revenge is at

hand.

PICARD: He's proved that he can get to us whenever he wants. Why

doesn't he do something?

[Ready room]

(Picard leaves his desk and goes to the replicator)

PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot.

(Bok is in his chair)

BOK: If you want me to stay and talk, you'd better not call for

security this time. How do you like your boy, Captain? Is he everything

you'd always hoped for?

PICARD: It's a risky game you're playing, coming here. Next time we'll

be ready for you. Why don't we settle this now?

BOK: Oh, and how do you propose to do that, Picard? You murdered my

son.

PICARD: It was self-defence. He fired on my ship.

BOK: You were in Ferengi space!

PICARD: I didn't know that. If he'd told me I would have withdrawn. I'm

sorry, but there's nothing I can do to bring him back.

BOK: How touching. Your apology is worthless to me. I demand that you

repay me for my loss.

PICARD: You cannot put a price on a life.

BOK: Oh, but you can, Picard. You can pay me with your son's life.

PICARD: No.

BOK: You don't have any choice. I insist on being paid.

(Bok beams out)

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: That should do it. Let's run a level three

bioscan just to be sure.

RHODES [OC]: Rhodes to Sickbay, Medical emergency, deck nine, section

four.

CRUSHER: Let's go.

[Jason's quarters]

(Jason appears to be having a fit. Crusher gives

him a hypo)

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Have you had any other seizures like this

before?

JASON: No, not really. Sometimes my hand shakes, but never this bad.

CRUSHER: When did it first start to happen?

JASON: About few months ago. Do you have any idea what's wrong with me?

CRUSHER: You have a condition called the Forrester Trent syndrome. It's

a degenerative neurological disorder. Very rare.

PICARD: What do you mean degenerative?

CRUSHER: If it goes untreated, it could result in paralysis, even

death. I'm going to start you on a neuro-stabilisation regimen. If

we're lucky, it will halt the degeneration, and maybe reverse its

effects. The disease is hereditary. I know your father doesn't have it.

Was your mother prone to these seizures?

JASON: Not that I know of.

CRUSHER: There have been some cases reported where the disease was

instigated by a random mutation. I'll run a microcellular scan and see

if that's what happened. In the meantime, I want you to try to take it

easy and get some rest.

(Jason leaves)

PICARD: Is he going to be all right?

CRUSHER: I wish I could say for certain, but I'm not sure how he'll

respond to treatments.

PICARD: I've been thinking about what you said the other day, and you

know, I think you were right. I had convinced myself that Jason didn't

want me to reach out to him.

CRUSHER: You know, I don't think anyone is born knowing how to be a

parent. You just sort of figure it out as you go. But the one quality

that tends to be a requirement for parenthood is patience.

PICARD: Well, I'm not sure that that is going to be enough. I've found

out that Jason has a criminal record. It's nothing very serious, it's

only petty theft and so forth, but I can't help feeling that if I had

been part of his life then he wouldn't be so troubled now.

CRUSHER: Maybe, but why waste time blaming yourself for not having been

there? Just be here for him now.

PICARD: And be patient.

CRUSHER: And be patient.

[Ready room]

LAFORGE: We think we've found something, Captain.

DATA: Bok was in direct contact with this chair for an extended period.

It is showing a distinctive subspace signature as a result.

LAFORGE: We think he's using some sort of subspace transporter to beam

aboard the Enterprise.

PICARD: My understanding is that such devices were impractical.

DATA: The Federation abandoned its research in the field because the

technology was found to be unreliable, as well as energy intensive.

LAFORGE: In order to transport matter through subspace, you have to put

it into a state of quantum flux. It's very unstable.

PICARD: What range would that kind of transporter have?

DATA: In theory it could operate over several light years.

LAFORGE: That means that the probe that exploded could have been beamed

into position from some point outside sensor range.

DATA: If Bok uses his transporter again, we might be able to trace the

subspace signature and locate his ship.

PICARD: Is there any way we can keep Bok from beaming aboard the

Enterprise again?

LAFORGE: I don't think there is.

PICARD: If he has the ability to beam aboard, he may be able to beam

someone away.

DATA: It is a possibility.

PICARD: I'm concerned that he may try to take Jason. Is there any way

we can protect him?

LAFORGE: You know, we might be able to keep a signal lock on him at all

times. If Bok tries to beam him away, we might be able to hold him

here.

DATA: In order to do so, we would need to tie the ship's subspace field

coils into the transporter system.

PICARD: Make it so. Computer, where is Jason Vigo?

COMPUTER: Jason Vigo is in holodeck four.

[Holodeck - rock face]

(Jason is climbing without equipment)

PICARD: (to security) Would you wait outside?

(Rhodes and her companion leave, then Picard climbs to join Jason on a

ledge)

JASON: Not bad.

PICARD: I like climbing. There's something about actually having your

fate in your own hands.

JASON: Yeah, I know.

PICARD: It looks as though we may have found out how to locate Bok's

ship. This could all soon be over.

JASON: You came all the way up here just to tell me that?

PICARD: I thought it would make you feel better.

JASON: Thanks. That was nice of you.

PICARD: Jason, when your mother and I parted, I lost track of her

completely. But I would like to know more about what happened to her,

if you wouldn't mind telling me.

JASON: Like what?

PICARD: Well, how did you end up on Camor? It's an unlikely place for a

woman and child.

JASON: Well, you know how she was. See a stray cat, take it in. See

somebody cold, give them your coat.

PICARD: Yes, that was Miranda, all right.

JASON: She heard about the all children on Camor who'd been orphaned

from the Cardassian war.

PICARD: Oh. I see.

JASON: I was only ten when we went there. I remember her telling me all

about the boys and girls who didn't have anybody to take care of them.

So she got this big house, practically falling apart, then she started

rounding up children. Eventually, there were over forty of us there.

She called it a school. You know, she got up before dawn every day and

went to bed well after midnight. In between she never stopped working.

She taught us all how to read. And she grew vegetables in hardpan to

feed us. And she made sure we knew how to sing. It's important in a

place like Camor. And then one day she was attacked by two men in the

street in broad daylight for the food she was carrying. If she'd just

given it to them, they probably wouldn't have hurt her. But she knew

how important the food was to us. So they killed her.

PICARD: I'm so sorry.

JASON: Don't be sorry for me. My mother made sure that we were all

tough enough to make it.

PICARD: Jason, isn't there some way that I can be a father to you? My

own father and I were estranged. He wanted me to stay home and tend the

vineyards and I wanted to join Starfleet. And he died before we could

come to terms with that. And I've regretted that all of my life. I

don't want the same thing to happen to you and me.

JASON: You don't understand. I'm not anybody you'd want for a son.

Trust me, if you knew anything about me, you wouldn't be trying so

hard.

PICARD: You're so wrong.

JASON: Oh, really? Let me spell it out for you. I've been in trouble

since I was a teenager. I lie, I steal, I use people. I'm a criminal.

That's what your son is.

PICARD: I know.

JASON: You do?

PICARD: Oh, yes, I know all about your troubles with the Camor

authorities.

JASON: You do.

PICARD: It doesn't make any difference, Jason. You're still my son.

And, like it or not, I'm your father. I don't know what that means, but

it means something. There's some connection.

JASON: Yeah.

PICARD: But one thing is clear. You'll never look at your hairline

again in the same way.

[Crusher's office]

PICARD: You wanted to see me.

CRUSHER: Yes. It's about Jason. I've finished the microcellular scan I

was running. There's something you need to know,

[Bridge]

DATA: Sir, sensors are detecting a subspace carrier

wave headed for the ship. Its signature is consistent with Bok's

transporter.

RIKER: See if you can trace and locate Bok's ship. Geordi, are you

ready down there?

LAFORGE [OC]: I've got a signal lock on Jason.

RIKER: Riker to Picard.

[Crusher's office]

PICARD: Picard here.

RIKER [OC]: Bok is trying to use his transporter.

[Bridge]

DATA: The transporter beam is focusing on deck

nine, section four.

RIKER: Jason's quarters.

LAFORGE [OC]: I'm on it, Commander.

RHODES [OC]: Security to Bridge. Bok is

[Jason's quarters]

RHODES: Beaming Jason off the ship.

[Transporter room]

LAFORGE: Initiating transport now. I'm losing his

signal.

(Picard enters)

LAFORGE: Bok is re-establishing his lock on him.

(Jason is beamed away)

[Bridge]

PICARD: Have you been able to locate Bok's ship?

DATA: No, sir. The subspace signature left by his transporter is

decaying more rapidly than predicted. It may not be possible to trace

it.

WORF: Captain, another probe has materialised five hundred kilometres

to starboard. It is sending a transmission.

PICARD: Put it on screen.

BOK [on viewscreen]: This is a very special day, Picard. Fifteen years

ago you took my son away from me. Today, I will take your son away from

you. It will be our anniversary. I wanted you to see him one last time.

(transmission ends)

DATA: I am tracing the transporter beam Bok used to send the probe. The

ship is holding position approximately three hundred billion kilometres

from here.

PICARD: Plot a course. Maximum warp.

RIKER: Even at warp nine we wouldn't get there for another twenty

minutes.

PICARD: The modifications you made to the transporter. Is there any way

we could use a subspace transport from here to get me onto Bok's ship?

DATA: It may be possible, sir, but it would not be advisable.

PICARD: I'll take that as a yes. You're with me.

[Transporter room]

LAFORGE: There. I've aligned the field coils.

DATA: Phase dampers are in synch. Standing by to modulate the transport

pattern.

LAFORGE: Captain, we might be able to get you over there, but I don't

see how we're going to get you back.

PICARD: (standing with phaser drawn) We'll deal with that when the time

comes.

LAFORGE: Transport's going to take longer than normal. We have to shunt

your pattern through the subspace field coils.

PICARD: Understood.

DATA: Initiating transport sequence now.

[Ferengi Bridge]

JASON: Maybe we can make a deal.

BOK: What kind of deal?

JASON: Tell my father you killed me. Put a phaser burn on my shirt and

send it to him. He'll think I'm dead. That's what this is about, isn't

it? I got friends on Camor Five that will make it worth your while.

BOK: I understand your desire to live, but I want Picard to see your

body so there will be no doubt.

(Picard beams in)

PICARD: Lower your weapons or Bok is dead.

BOK: Lower yours or your son dies.

PICARD: You know as well as I do, Bok, he's not my son. I know what

you've done. Miranda Vigo is his mother but I am not his father. You

made it appear so because you resequenced his DNA. But your technique

was flawed. He developed a neurological disorder. When my ship's Doctor

investigated it, she discovered what you had done.

TOL: Now he'll never pay the ransom.

BOK: Shut up.

PICARD: There never was a ransom. All he was ever interested in was

vengeance.

TOL: DaiMon, is this true?

PICARD: He's not a DaiMon. He was stripped of command.

BOK: They had no right to do that to me.

PICARD: He lied to you so that you would help him in his plan. The

Enterprise is closing in on your position. If you let the two of us go,

they won't attack you.

BOK: They won't attack us with you on board.

PICARD: They will cripple your vessel and keep you here until the

Ferengi authorities arrive. You've got a lot deal of explaining to do.

Your only hope is to turn Bok over to them and tell them that he

deceived you.

(Tol disarms Bok)

TOL: There is no profit in this for us.

Captain's log, stardate 47831.8. At Jason's

request, the Enterprise has returned to Camor Five.

[Corridor]

JASON: Doctor Crusher feels I'm responding well to

the treatment. She thinks that the damage may be completely reversed.

PICARD: I'm glad to hear it.

JASON: Yeah.

PICARD: Are you sure that you wouldn't like to stay on board the

Enterprise for a few more days?

JASON: I can't. I have a life back on Camor. It's a mess, but I'd like

to go back and straighten things out.

PICARD: I understand.

[Transporter room]

JASON: Well, maybe next time you come back this

way, you can look me up.

PICARD: I will. I put a little something into your bag while you were

packing. (the Gorlan Prayer stick) I know you'd probably have preferred

a bottle of Saurian brandy, but that's all I could come up with.

JASON: I can't accept this.

PICARD: I want you to have it.

(they shake hands and Jason gets on the pad)

PICARD: Energise.

47869.2

Original Airdate: 9 May, 1994

  [Holodeck

- Prospero's island]

(Shakespeare time, and Data is playing Prospero,

from The Tempest, in near darkness)

DATA: Graves at my command have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em

forth by my so potent art. But this rough magic I here abjure, and when

I have required some heavenly music, which even now I do, to work mine

end upon their senses, that this airy charm is for, I'll break my

staff, bury it certain fathoms in the earth, and deeper than did ever

plummet sound, I'll (breaks character) Captain? Sir, your attention is

wandering.

PICARD: Data, I can barely see.

DATA: But sir, I am supposed to be attempting a Neo-Platonic magical

rite. The darkness is appropriate for such a ritual.

PICARD: Yes, but Data, this is a play. The audience has to see you.

DATA: Perhaps I have been too literal with respect to my set design.

Computer, modify holodeck

programme Data seven three.

Shakespeare's

The Tempest, Act Five, scene one. Increase

torchlight by twenty percent.

PICARD: There, that's much better. Now, do you want to try it again?

DATA: Yes, sir. Captain, I am not certain I fully understand this

Prospero character. I would appreciate any insight you might have that

would improve my performance.

PICARD: Well, Data, Shakespeare was witnessing the end of the

Renaissance and the birth of the modern era, and Prospero finds himself

in a world where his powers are no longer needed. So, we see him here

about to perform one final creative act before giving up his art

forever.

DATA: There is certainly a tragic aspect to the character.

PICARD: Yes, but there's a certain expectancy too. A hopefulness about

the future. You see, Shakespeare enjoyed mixing opposites. The past and

the future. Hope and despair. Data, what is this? Is this part of your

programme?

(bright lights are coming towards them, a steam whistle blows)

DATA: No, sir.

PICARD: What is going on?

DATA: It appears to be a steam locomotive.

PICARD: A train?

DATA: If I am not mistaken.

PICARD: Computer, end programme.

(the train's headlight reaches them)

PICARD: Computer, end programme.

(Data pushes Picard out of the way as the train thunders past)

[Corridor]

DATA: Captain, you are injured.

(Picard has a graze on his cheek)

PICARD: Oh yes, I know. I'll get it seen to, Data.

(Data checks the holodeck controls)

DATA: The train we encountered was from one of Doctor Crusher's

holodeck programs. It was a re-creation of the Orient Express, a train

which travelled from Paris to Istanbul from the late nineteenth century

until.

PICARD: Yes, yes, Data, I know about the Orient Express. But what is it

doing on Prospero's Island?

DATA: There appears to have been a malfunction in the holodeck's

database retrieval

programme. The two programs somehow temporarily linked together.

PICARD: Is it possible that this malfunction will affect the other

holodecks as well?

DATA: It is a possibility. I will need to run a diagnostic to be

certain.

PICARD: Very good, Data. But shut down the other holodecks until you're

finished, just to be on the safe side.

DATA: Aye, sir.

[Sickbay]

PICARD: I never realised that you were interested

in trains. Are you aware that at its peak, the Orient Express carried

more than ten thousand

people a year?

CRUSHER: It isn't really the train itself that I'm interested in.

PICARD: What then?

CRUSHER: It's the experience. The Orient Express is romantic,

mysterious, an elegant way to see exotic places and meet fascinating

people. Do you know that one time, on one trip, both Sigmund Freud and

Gertrude Stein just happened to be in the same car? They ended up

having dinner together every night.

PICARD: I wonder what they talked about?

CRUSHER: Why don't you take a trip yourself and find out?

RIKER [OC]: Riker to Picard.

PICARD: Picard here.

RIKER [OC]: All sections ready to begin the survey, sir.

PICARD: Very good. I'm on my way. Thank you.

CRUSHER: Don't forget the trip, Jean-Luc. Think about it. You never

know who you'll meet on the Orient Express.

Captain's log, stardate 47869.2. After weathering

an unexpected magnascopic storm in the Mekorda Sector, we are

continuing our search for new Federation colony sites.

[Bridge]

RIKER: I don't think there's any possibility of

developing sites in this region. Most of the stars are main sequence

binaries. There are no M-class planets.

PICARD: Well, let's move on to another survey region. Have stellar

cartography begin a

(Enterprise lurches forward)

PICARD: Mister Data, report.

DATA: The ship has moved into warp, sir.

RIKER: Who gave that command?

DATA: Apparently no one. Helm and navigation controls are not

functioning. Our speed is now warp seven point three and holding.

PICARD: Picard to Engineering.

[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Mister La Forge, what's going on?

We've lost primary helm control on the Bridge.

LAFORGE: I don't understand it. The impulse systems suddenly cut out

and the warp drive just kicked in.

RIKER [OC]: Geordi, can you take the engines offline?

LAFORGE: I'm working on it.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister Data, what's our heading?

DATA: Bearing one eight seven mark four. I am unable to determine our

destination, however we are heading away from the Mekorda sector.

LAFORGE [OC]: Captain, the computer's locked out all the propulsion

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Controls. I can't access any of the

overrides.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: If you want us to stop, I'll have to

do an emergency core shutdown.

RIKER: That would leave us without warp power for more than a week.

PICARD: Begin the procedure, Mister La Forge.

(another jolt)

DATA: We are no longer at warp, sir. Impulse power has resumed. All

systems show normal.

RIKER: Where are we?

DATA: We are approximately thirty billion kilometres from our original

position.

PICARD: Well done, Mister La Forge.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: It wasn't me. I didn't have time to

complete the shut-down procedure.

PICARD [OC]: Well, I want an explanation

[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister La Forge. Picard out.

(later at the science station)

PICARD: Have you found anything yet?

LAFORGE: Only that we seem to have more than one mystery here. We still

don't know why the ship jumped into warp, but it looks like we're lucky

it did. There was a theta flux distortion building up around the ship.

PICARD: Why didn't our sensors alert us?

LAFORGE: Our sensors were never designed to detect theta flux

distortions. And yet there is a record of the distortion in the sensor

log. That's the other mystery.

DATA: One fact is clear, however. The distortion was growing in

strength. If we had remained at our original position one point seven

seconds longer, the distortion would have ruptured our warp core.

LAFORGE: If the Enterprise hadn't jumped into warp when it did, we

would've been blown to pieces.

[Jefferies tube]

LAFORGE: I just don't get it, Data. What would

cause the engines to suddenly jump into warp?

DATA: Perhaps the engines were activated by a random power fluctuation.

LAFORGE: Which occurred just in time to save the ship?

DATA: It is improbable, but it is possible.

LAFORGE: I don't know. I don't think I'm ready to start believing in

luck.

(they stop by an access panel)

DATA: There is another possibility.

LAFORGE: Yeah, what's that.

DATA: The sensors apparently detected a dangerous anomaly that

threatened the Enterprise. It is possible that they triggered a safety

device which caused the ship to avoid destruction.

LAFORGE: Yeah, but there's no direct link between the warp engines and

the sensors.

(they open the panel)

LAFORGE: Whoa. What is that? It's some kind of new circuit node and

it's connected to at least half a dozen points in the sensor array.

DATA: It appears to be connected to several other systems as well,

including the warp control circuits.

LAFORGE: I guess there's a connection between the warp engines and the

sensors after all.

(a forcefield blocks access to the node)

LAFORGE: A force field. Where did that come from?

DATA: I am not certain. Perhaps it came from the node itself.

LAFORGE: Well, wherever it came from, it sure doesn't want us messing

with this node.

DATA: It appears to be protecting itself.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We found these nodes in several systems

around the ship. At some level or another, they're all connected.

DATA: These nodes were linking the sensors to our warp control and

defensive systems. We believe this is why the ship jumped to warp.

LAFORGE: When the sensors detected danger, the defensive systems

reacted to the threat and activated the warp engines to protect us.

RIKER: Where did these nodes come from?

DATA: It is possible that the magnascopic storm we recently experienced

had an unexpected effect on the ship's systems.

LAFORGE: Wherever they come from, they seem to be multiplying.

DATA: As they increase, it will become progressively more difficult to

control the ship.

RIKER: What do you propose we do?

LAFORGE: Well, getting rid of them isn't going to be so easy. When we

attempted to examine the circuitry of one of the nodes, it generated a

force field to keep us out.

RIKER: Whatever's going on. our first priority is getting back control

of the ship.

DATA: Agreed. All of the nodal connections intersect in holodeck three.

It appears to be a focal point of some kind.

LAFORGE: We might be able to find a way to use the holodeck circuitry

to disable the nodes permanently.

RIKER: All right. Let's do it.

[Corridor]

DATA: Commander, the holodeck appears to be in

operation.

RIKER: I thought you shut down the entire system.

DATA: I did, but it has reactivated itself and it will not disengage.

WORF: Which programme is running?

DATA: Several different programs are running simultaneously.

RIKER: This should be interesting.

[Holodeck- train]

(a knight in armour is cutting a newspaper, a

rustic is standing, two 1920's women and a man are working on a jigsaw,

a gunslinger takes a piece out of his pocket and adds it to the jigsaw)

RIKER: You weren't kidding, Mister Data.

DATA: No, sir. I estimate that this scene consists of portions of seven

distinct holodeck programs.

RIKER: See if you can access the circuits that have been affected by

the nodes.

(an American train conductor enters)

CONDUCTOR: Tickets! Tickets please. Please have your tickets ready.

Thank you, sir. Thank you, madam. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Tickets

please.

RUSTIC: You know, I've never even been away from home. Now I'm going

all the way to Vertiform City!

CONDUCTOR: Very nice, sir. Enjoy your trip. Tickets please. Tickets.

Thank you sir.

(The conductor clips one of the knight's string of paper dolls)

CONDUCTOR: Tickets please. Tickets please.

DATA: Commander. I have located a large concentration of nodes behind

this wall. They appear to be connected directly to the holodeck's main

power coupling.

RIKER: All right, go ahead and depolarise the entire power grid.

DATA: The power grid is located beneath this deck, sir.

CONDUCTOR: Get away from there. Would you gentlemen care to show me

your tickets?

RIKER: I believe we left our tickets in our compartments. Mister Worf,

I told you to bring the tickets.

WORF: I forgot.

CONDUCTOR: I don't think you folks belong on this train.

ENGINEER: Hold it! You leave these people alone. They're only trying to

help.

CONDUCTOR: You go back to the engine. This doesn't concern you.

ENGINEER: They're all trying to hijack the train.

RUSTIC: Hey, if you're the Engineer, who's doing the drivin'?

(a gangster shoots the Engineer in the back)

GANGSTER: I am.

[Engineering]

(a console explodes in front of Geordi, throwing

him backwards)

CREWMAN: Easy, sir, easy. I've got you.

LAFORGE: I'm all right, thanks. It looks like the navigational relay's

overloaded.

[Holodeck train]

(the conductor pulls the cord and the train

lurches. So does the ship)

[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Geordi, what's going on? We just went

into warp.

LAFORGE: We've lost engine and helm control again, Captain, but this

time, they're completely burned out. I don't know if we can stop the

ship.

[Holodeck- train]

DATA: I believe we have changed direction.

CONDUCTOR: Now we're on the right track. Ladies and gentlemen, we are

on our way!

(cheers all round and the gangster takes a house brick from the

engineer's overalls)

GANGSTER: I was right. He was trying to make off with my brick.

CONDUCTOR: You take good care of that. We can't afford to lose it. Now,

are you people going to leave or are we going to have to throw you off

the train?

DATA: Commander. According to my tricorder, the holodeck safeties have

been disengaged. His weapon could be lethal.

RIKER: All right, let's get out of here.

[Engineering]

DATA: The number of systems now being affected by

the nodes has increased considerably. Sensors, engines, replicators,

propulsion, they are all working together now, almost independently of

the main computer. And the nodes link them all through the holodeck.

RIKER: But why the holodeck? It doesn't make any sense.

DATA: Commander, I believe what happens on the holodeck has a direct

effect on the ship. When we attempted to destroy the nodes, the

characters on the train responded almost immediately to stop us.

RIKER: And when the engineer tried to protect us, one of the characters

shot him.

DATA: Then the conductor then signalled for the train to change

directions, and at approximately the same time

LAFORGE: The Enterprise also took off in a new direction.

RIKER: Are you saying the ship is under the control of the holodeck?

DATA: Not precisely. Geordi, does the configuration of connection nodes

look familiar to you?

LAFORGE: Yeah. Yeah, it looks a little like the structure of your

positronic brain.

DATA: That is correct. It would appear that the nodes are in the

process of creating a rudimentary neural net.

RIKER: Data, what are you suggesting?

DATA: Unlikely as it may sound, I believe that the Enterprise may be

forming an intelligence.

[Observation lounge]

DATA: This is a synaptic map of the human

neo-cortex. This is a cross section of my positronic net. And this is a

schematic of the connection nodes linking the ship's systems. I believe

some sort of neural matrix is forming on the ship. It is still

relatively primitive, but it is an intelligence nonetheless.

TROI: How could that happen?

DATA: I believe it is an emergent property.

PICARD: Explain.

DATA: Complex systems can sometimes behave in ways that are entirely

unpredictable. The human brain, for example, might be described in

terms of cellular functions and neurochemical interactions. But that

description does not explain human consciousness, a capacity that far

exceeds simple neural functions. Consciousness is an emergent property.

LAFORGE: In other words, something that's more than just the sum of its

parts.

DATA: Exactly.

CRUSHER: How does that explain what's happening to the Enterprise?

DATA: The Enterprise contains a vast database of information which is

managed by a sophisticated computer. This complex system gives the ship

many of the characteristics of a biological organism.

RIKER: That's true. It sees with its sensors, it talks with its

communications systems.

CRUSHER: In a sense, it almost reproduces with the replicators.

PICARD: And you think that the ship has somehow gone beyond those

functions and is developing a new capacity?

DATA: Yes, sir. I believe a self-determining intelligence is emerging.

WORF: If that is so, what does the ship want? Where is it taking us?

DATA: I believe the key to understanding the ship's behaviour lies in

the holodeck. All of the connection nodes intersect at that location.

It is clearly some kind of processing centre.

PICARD: Processing centre?

DATA: Yes, sir. A focal point where all the ideas and instincts of this

emerging intelligence are first expressed in some form.

TROI: Almost like an imagination. Captain, I'd like to go to the

holodeck. I could interact with the characters and maybe find some

clues to help us understand what's happening.

PICARD: Very well. Mister Data, Mister Worf, I want you to go along.

See if you can to re-establish control of the ship without damaging the

nodes. If the ship is truly an emerging intelligence, then we have a

responsibility to treat it with the same respect as any other being.

[Holodeck - train]

(things have changed. A flapper is repeatedly

tapping a goblet against the knight's helm. The gunslinger is tied up

while the gangster plays cards with him.)

WORF: Welcome aboard, Counsellor.

DATA: If you will distract these people, I will attempt to depolarise

the power grid.

(Troi and Worf go over the rustic and the other flapper who are working

on the jigsaw)

WORF: Excuse me. Have you finished the puzzle yet?

RUSTIC: Not yet, but we're gettin' close.

WORF: Do you recognise it?

TROI: No.

WORF: I would like to help. Tell me. What exactly are you making?

RUSTIC: What do you think we're making? A puzzle!

WORF: No, I meant the picture. What is it?

RUSTIC: Well, I don't know.

(Troi goes to the card game)

TROI: Can you deal me in?

GANGSTER: Sorry. It's a two man game.

(Troi reaches for the brick)

GANGSTER: Hey! Get your hand off of that.

TROI: Is that why you killed the Engineer? To get this brick?

GANGSTER: I had to get it back. You know how much it's worth, lady?

Plenty. And I

got to get it to Keystone City.

TROI: Why? What's at Keystone City?

GANGSTER: That's where everything begins. Gin.

(his five cards all show the jigsaw)

WORF: Are you succeeding, Commander?

DATA: I am ready to access the main power grid.

CONDUCTOR: Keystone City, next stop. Keystone City. Well, look who's

back.

WORF: We do not want any trouble. We are simply passengers.

CONDUCTOR: Well then I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me your

tickets? Right. Sorry, boys. You're getting off right here.

GANGSTER: This is my stop.

TROI: Wait. What happens at Keystone City? Why are you taking the brick

there?

GANGSTER: Excuse me.

TROI: I think we should follow that man. That brick may be an important

clue.

[Holodeck - subway]

(the Gangster goes up the subway steps from the New

York City Transit System at Broadway + 7th)

TROI: Where did he go?

(they walk down the empty street to a manhole cover)

DATA: I can access the power grid here. I will attempt to depolarise

the grid by using a low frequency inversion field. It may disengage the

nodes without destroying them.

TROI: There he is. I'm going after him.

(Worf goes with her, leaving Data alone. Sunshine taxi registration

H20638 hurtles round the corner and drives straight at him. Data rolls

out of the way and carries on his work)

[Holodeck - wall]

(the Gangster comes to a building with scaffolding,

and a wall where there is one brick missing from the middle)

TROI: What are you doing here?

GANGSTER: Laying the foundation.

(he puts his brick into the gap, it glows then blends in with the rest

of the wall)

GANGSTER: Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a train to catch.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: I don't understand it, Captain. All of a

sudden, cargo bay five started to depressurise.

PICARD: Did everyone get out in time?

LAFORGE: Yes, sir, and I've re-established the containment field, but

I'm reading massive power surges in the cargo bay and all sorts of

transporter activity. Something weird is happening there, Captain.

PICARD: I want you to send a team down there immediately. Find out

what's going on.

LAFORGE: Aye, sir.

[Cargo bay]

(in the middle of the floor, a 3d version of the

jigsaw is growing with a light inside it)

LAFORGE: La Forge to Bridge.

PICARD [OC]: Picard here. What's going on?

LAFORGE: I wish I could tell you.

[Holodeck - building site]

TROI: That man said he was laying a foundation.

WORF: Foundation for what?

TROI: Troi to Data

DATA [OC]: Data here.

TROI: How are you doing?

[Holodeck - street]

DATA: I encountered a minor difficulty, Counsellor,

but it has been dealt with.

(he is holding the revving taxi with one hand)

DATA: I am ready to depolarise the power grid.

[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: It looks like the ship's replicator and

transporter systems have been merged somehow. to create this. The

question is, what is it? Ensign, I want to run a full spectral analysis

on this.

(the ship shakes and a barrel falls)

LAFORGE: I'm picking up a massive power fluctuations. The ship is

losing its structural integrity.

[Holodeck - wall]

TROI: What's happening?

WORF: It's an earthquake.

(the wall collapses on top of Deanna, revealing a door with number 1156

etched in the glass.)

[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: La Forge to Data

[Holodeck - street]

LAFORGE: Stop what you're doing.

DATA: Acknowledged.

(the quake stops)

[Holodeck - wall]

WORF: Are you all right?

TROI: I'm fine.

[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: Data, I think we ought to get together and

compare notes.

DATA [OC]: Agreed.

[Sickbay]

(Troi is having her grazes healed)

TROI: The ship was protecting itself again. Stopping us from

interfering. Whatever it's doing it intends to continue.

LAFORGE: I'm betting it all has something to do with that object that's

forming in the cargo bay.

TROI: I think he's right, Captain. Look at the common themes playing

out on the holodeck. A puzzle being put together, a foundation being

laid, a paper doll being fashioned. They're all images of something

being constructed.

LAFORGE: And some kind of object in the cargo bay that's being

constructed atom by atom.

PICARD: What is that object?

LAFORGE: I have no idea. It's composed of silica polymers, duranium,

and a couple of other compounds we

haven't been able to identify yet.

But creating it has had quite an effect on our systems. Warp power has

dropped forty seven percent.

PICARD: Counsellor, did you draw any other conclusions from your

experiences on the holodeck? Anything that would help us to understand

this situation?

TROI: The holodeck was full of metaphoric imagery like it was having

some kind of daydream. It may not make literal sense, but symbolically

it probably does have some kind of logic to it.

CRUSHER: The characters you spoke to, do they have any significance?

TROI: I think they represent different aspects of the ship. The

Engineer, for instance, may represent the navigational system, the

gunslinger could be the weapon system.

PICARD: Is there any way that we can persuade them to give back control

of the ship?

TROI: I don't think it's possible to reason with them. Many of them are

genuinely unaware of what's going on. It's as though this emergent

intelligence is like an infant acting on impulse, trying to figure

itself out as it goes. The only source of experience it can draw on is

ours through our holodeck programs.

PICARD: Is there a way that we can relate to them on their own level,

find some way to influence their behaviour?

TROI: Maybe there is. I'd like to go back and try.

LAFORGE: Counsellor, we haven't been able to re-establish the safeties.

CRUSHER: The injuries you suffered on the holodeck weren't severe, but

next time they might kill you.

TROI: I'm aware of that.

PICARD: Very well, Counsellor, go ahead. But bear in mind that whenever

we have tried to hinder their efforts, we've failed. Perhaps it's time

to cooperate with them.

[Holodeck - train]



CONDUCTOR: You don't belong on this train.

WORF: Three tickets for Vertiform City.

CONDUCTOR: Guess I was wrong about you folks. Welcome aboard.

(the lights dim)

WORF: What was that?

CONDUCTOR: We've been having some problems. The engine is running out

of steam. I hope we make it to Vertiform City on time.

TROI: Is there anything we can do to help?

CONDUCTOR: Well, I could use a pair of strong arms in the engine room.

Might help us get back on schedule.

TROI: Why don't you go with him, Worf? We'll see what we can do here.

(Worf and the conductor leave)

RUSTIC: Excuse me. Are we going to get there okay?

TROI: Of course. You needn't worry about a thing. So, tell me

everything you know about Vertiform City.

RUSTIC: Well, they got this restaurant there where you can eat all you

want, any time. It's the best food around.

[Holodeck - Engine room]

(coal fired of course, like the TOS blooper)

CONDUCTOR: There's the coal and there's the boiler. I'm much obliged

for your help.

(Worf starts stoking)

CONDUCTOR: Well done, sir. I think this'll make a difference, all

right.

[Bridge]

RIKER: I don't know how or why, sir, but warp power

appears to be back to normal levels.

PICARD: What's our heading?

RIKER: We appear to be on a course for Tambor Beta six. It's a white

dwarf star.

[Holodeck - Engine room]

CONDUCTOR: Keep it steady. Put your back into it.

That's the ticket.

[Bridge]

RIKER: The ship is using a modified tractor beam to

collect vertion particles from the star.

PICARD: Vertion particles. Vertiform City. That's what the ship was

looking for.

(shudder)

RIKER: The particles are being routed through the transporter system

into cargo bay five.

PICARD: Geordi, what's going on?

LAFORGE [OC]: The object is absorbing

[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: Vertion particles. It's growing even

faster than before. Commander, I'm picking up internal energy this

thing.

[Bridge]

RIKER: What do you mean?

LAFORGE [OC]: I mean it's generating its own energy. I'm picking up

coherent emissions

[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: Matter conversion. It's incredible. Wait a

minute. Wait a minute, something's wrong. We've got power fluctuations.

Vertion absorption rate is dropping. What's happening to the particle

beam?

[Bridge]

RIKER: The beam's exhausted the supply of particles

in the star. There's nothing left to take out.

LAFORGE [OC]: Captain

[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: The energy output of the object is

decreasing.

[Holodeck - Engine room]

CONDUCTOR: Something's wrong.

WORF: What is it?

CONDUCTOR: This was supposed to be Vertiform City. (the beam disengages

and the object stops glowing)

CONDUCTOR: We've been on the wrong track all along.

(the Conductor pulls the brake lever and everyone gets thrown around)

[Holodeck- train]

WORF: Are you all right?

TROI: Yes. What happened?

WORF: The Conductor accidently derailed the train.

DATA: Data to Captain Picard.

[Cargo bay]

PICARD: Picard here.

DATA [OC]: There has been an accident on the holodeck, sir. Has

anything happened to the Enterprise?

PICARD: Yes, we've had a ship-wide shutdown. We've lost attitude

control and most systems are offline.

LAFORGE: Captain, you'd better take a look at this. When the particle

beam cut off, the object was beginning to form a coherent energy

matrix. Now, if these readings are accurate, I'd say that the emission

patterns were almost organic.

PICARD: Are you suggesting that the Enterprise is trying to create a

lifeform?

LAFORGE: I think so.

PICARD: Will it survive?

LAFORGE: Well, its energy levels are dropping rapidly. Unless it gets

an infusion of vertion particles, and I mean soon, I don't think so.

(rumble, and Geordi checks a console)

LAFORGE: Captain, all of our systems are back online and we're moving

again, at warp nine.

PICARD: Let's get back to the Bridge.

[Holodeck- train]

(everything's back to normal)

RUSTIC: Whoo wee, that was a close one, wasn't it?

TROI: Where are we going now?

RUSTIC: Well, New Vertiform City, of course.

DATA: Data to Captain.

PICARD [OC]: Picard here.

DATA: The train has returned to normal, sir. Our destination is New

Vertiform City.

[Bridge]

PICARD: What's our course?

RIKER: We're heading for the Cordannas system.

PICARD: Another white dwarf star.

RIKER: It's the nearest one to our last position.

LAFORGE: Captain, we have a problem. Even at warp nine, the Cordannas

system is over twelve hours from here.

PICARD: Will the object in the cargo bay survive that long?

LAFORGE: Yes, sir, but that's not the problem. The ship has diverted

all of our systems to maximum propulsion, including life support. We

have less than two hours of reserve oxygen.

PICARD: Mister Data, we have to stop the Enterprise. That means you

have to get control of the train.

DATA [OC]: Understood, sir.

PICARD: The ship is looking for vertion particles and it believes that

the Cordannas system is the closest source. Is there any possibility of

anything closer?

LAFORGE: White dwarf stars are the only natural sources of vertions,

sir.

PICARD: Then what about artificial ones? Can you create the particles?

[Holodeck - train]

DATA: How did the Conductor stop the train?

WORF: There is a braking lever in the engine room.

TROI: Let's go.

RUSTIC: Sorry, folks, but you ain't going nowhere.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: I've narrowed the search to the MacPherson

Nebula, which is a supernova remnant, and Dikon Alpha, which is a class

nine pulsar. They're both fairly close to our current flight path and

either one could produce vertion particles if we detonated a modified

photon torpedo inside it.

RIKER: Vertions usually occur in miniscule amounts. Do you think either

of these phenomena could produce enough of them?

LAFORGE: It's really hard to say. I can't even guarantee that we can

create them at all.

PICARD: Well, we've got to give it a try. The nebula or the pulsar?

It's your choice, Mister La Forge.

LAFORGE: I say go with the nebula.

PICARD: Very well. Begin the torpedo modifications.

RIKER: Now let's see if we can get this ship to go where we want.

[Holodeck- train]

TROI: Please listen to me. We understand what's

happening. We know you have get to New Vertiform City, and we want to

help you get there.

RUSTIC: Well, I don't know.

TROI: Please, we're your friends.

RUSTIC: You're really going to help get us to New Vertiform City?

TROI: I promise.

RUSTIC: Okay. But just one of you. The rest stay here.

[Holodeck - Engine room]

CONDUCTOR: That's far enough.

GANGSTER: Sorry to spoil your party, pal. It's nothing personal.

DATA: I can get us there more quickly. I know a shorter route.

GANGSTER: Don't listen to him. He's up to somethin'.

CONDUCTOR: A shorter route?

DATA: Yes, if you will let me handle the controls.

GANGSTER: Don't do it.

CONDUCTOR: Well we're already behind schedule. If you can get us there

on time. All right, go on, but no funny stuff.

DATA: Data to Captain Picard. I have taken control of the engine room.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Stand by. Are we within sensor range of the

nebula?

LAFORGE: Yes, Captain, we are.

PICARD: Mister Data, I need you to slow us to impulse speed.

[Holodeck - Engine room]

DATA: I will attempt to do so.

CONDUCTOR: I hope you know what you're doing.

(Data closes a valve and pulls on the brake)

[Bridge]

PICARD: Are the modifications to the torpedoes

complete?

LAFORGE: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Launch torpedo.

(whoosh, KaBOOM)

LAFORGE: It's working, Captain. The reaction is producing vertion

particles.

[Holodeck Engine room]

CONDUCTOR: Well, what do you know? We're here.

GANGSTER: New Vertiform City.

[Cargo bay]

RIKER: The nodes are deactivating all over the

ship. Our systems are beginning to function normally again.

PICARD: Then the purpose of the ship's intelligence was simply to bring

this life form into being.

CRUSHER: There are some species whose sole purpose is to reproduce.

Once they finally procreate, they die.

LAFORGE: Captain.

(the bizarre thing lifts off the floor, becomes bright light and flies

out through the hull)

[Holodeck - train]

(it's a champagne send-off for baby, and as they

sip their drinks, Troi, Worf

and Data are in an empty holodeck)

Captain's log, supplemental. The Enterprise is back

under our control. All traces of the emergent intelligence are gone and

the object it created has disappeared into space.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come.

(Data enters)

DATA: Captain, I am staging a scene from The Tempest this evening for a

small audience. I would like for you to attend.

PICARD: I would be honoured. What scene?

DATA: Miranda's first encounter with other human beings.

PICARD: O brave new world, that has such people in it.

DATA: It seemed appropriate. Captain, you took a substantial risk in

allowing the Enterprise to complete its task.

PICARD: Why do you say that?

DATA: Because the end result was unknown. The object could have been

dangerous. It may in fact, be dangerous.

PICARD: And I have allowed it to go off on its merry way.

DATA: Yes, sir.

PICARD: The intelligence that was formed on the Enterprise didn't just

come out of the ship's systems. It came from us. From our mission

records, personal logs, holodeck programs, our fantasies. Now, if our

experiences with the Enterprise have been honourable, can't we trust

that the sum of those experiences will be the same?

Strike

Stardate:

47941.7

Original Airdate: 16 May, 1994



Captain's log, stardate 47941.7. The Enterprise is en route to a

briefing on the situation in the Demilitarised Zone along the

Cardassian border. Meanwhile, we're celebrating the return of an old

friend.

[Ten Forward]

LAFORGE: Ro!

CRUSHER: Welcome home.

RO: Thanks. It's good to be back.

TROI: Congratulations on your promotion, Lieutenant.

RO: Same to you, Commander.

TROI: Thank you.

LAFORGE: Say, I understand that Advanced Tactical Training is a real

picnic.

RO: Right.

CRUSHER: Did you see the buffet?

TROI: This is real Bajoran foraiga.

LAFORGE: It wasn't easy to find.

RO: You shouldn't have gone to all this trouble. Really.

CRUSHER: We wanted you to know how glad we are to have you back.

(Picard leaves in the background)

TROI: So, where are your new quarters?

RO: Deck four, section eight.

CRUSHER: What are do you planning to do

PICARD [OC]: Lieutenant Ro.

RO: Go ahead, sir.

PICARD [OC]: Please report to the Bridge.

RO: Yes, sir. Excuse me.

[Corridor]

RO: Captain.

PICARD: You seemed a bit overwhelmed by all the attention.

RO: Well, to tell you the truth, I really want to see everyone. I'd

just rather do it one at a time.

PICARD: You look very fit, Lieutenant. Tactical Training seems to agree

with you.

RO: You know me, I enjoy a challenge.

PICARD: That school is more than a challenge. Half the class washes out

every year. But somehow I didn't think you'd be one of those.

RO: Captain, I want you to know that I really appreciate your

recommending me. If it weren't for you, my life would be a very

different one right now.

RIKER [OC]: Bridge to Picard.

PICARD: Go ahead.

[Bridge]

RIKER: We're receiving a distress signal from a

Cardassian ship near the Demilitarised Zone.

[Corridor]

PICARD: Change course to intercept. I'm on my way.

I'd like you at the conn, Lieutenant.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Ensign Gates.

(Gates gives up her seat for Ro)

PICARD: Report.

RIKER: The Cardassian ship relayed a distress signal but it was cut off

before we could find out what was wrong.

RO: I have the ship on long range sensors. It appears to be under

attack by several small ships.

PICARD: Can you identify them?

RO: No, sir. They're not transmitting identification codes.

DATA: I will scan their warp signatures. Sir, sensors indicate the

attacking vessels are Federation ships.

(after the opening credits)

RO: We're coming into visual range.

PICARD: On screen.

RIKER: Those are Federation ships.

PICARD: Isolate one and magnify. The Maquis. Open a channel.

WORF: Open.

PICARD: To all Maquis ships. Call off your attack or we will be forced

to engage you.

WORF: No response.

PICARD: You are Federation citizens. Your actions are in violation of

our treaty with the Cardassians. Call off your attack.

DATA: They are not responding, sir.

PICARD: Mister Worf, are we in firing range?

WORF: Not yet, sir.

PICARD: Arm phasers and photon torpedoes and stand by.

RIKER: I never thought we'd be firing on our own people to protect a

Cardassian ship.

DATA: The Maquis ships are regrouping, sir. They are closing in on the

Cardassian vessel.

WORF: The Cardassian's shields are down to thirty percent.

RIKER: They may not be able to withstand another hit.

WORF: Sir, we are within weapons range.

PICARD: Mister Worf, can you detonate a torpedo spread between the

Maquis ships and the Cardassians?

WORF: Yes, sir.

PICARD: Do it.

(four bolts of light whoosh off)

WORF: The Maquis are breaking formation. They are withdrawing.

PICARD: Signal the Cardassians that we're standing by to assist them if

they have any wounded.

WORF: Aye, sir.

[Sickbay]

GUL EVEK: Do you people have experience treating

Cardassians?

CRUSHER: Yes. Do you mind?

PICARD: Gul Evek. I'm sorry that we could not come to your aid sooner.

GUL EVEK: I suppose we're lucky you came at all. Lately Starfleet seems

to look the other way when the Maquis attack.

PICARD: I can assure you that is not the case. We're doing everything

in our power to control them.

GUL EVEK: The fact that my ship was attacked suggests that your efforts

have met with limited success. They came at us with photon torpedoes

and type eight phasers. Tell me, Captain, how do you suppose that a

group of civilians acquired such weaponry?

PICARD: I can assure you it was not through official channels.

GUL EVEK: So you don't think the fact that some of the Maquis are

former Starfleet officers has anything to do with it?

PICARD: Starfleet does not condone the Maquis' actions in the

Demilitarised Zone any more than your government would condone the

paramilitary actions of Cardassian civilians.

GUL EVEK: We have taken measures to deal with our colonists who have

armed themselves.

PICARD: Considering that they destroyed a Juhryan freighter less than a

week ago, I would say that your efforts are meeting with limited

success.

GUL EVEK: Captain, if the Maquis are not stopped, this situation will

continue to escalate to the point where the Cardassian military will

have no choice but to take matters into their own hands.

Captain's log, supplemental. Gul Evek and his crew

have left the Enterprise, and we have proceeded to our rendezvous with

Admiral Nechayev.

[Ready room]

NECHAYEV: No Bularian canapés this time, Captain?

PICARD: I thought twice was pushing it a little.

NECHAYEV: It's just as well. They're extremely fattening.

PICARD: You missed Gul Evek by a matter of hours. I asked him to stay.

I thought that an Admiral's assurances might convince him that we are

trying to deal with this Maquis situation.

NECHAYEV: Evek manages to make the Cardassians sound like helpless

sheep being preyed on by Federation wolves. The truth is, we caught the

Cardassian government supplying its colonies in the Demilitarised Zone

with weapons.

PICARD: Gul Evek assured me that they had stopped that practice.

NECHAYEV: Ha. How comforting.

PICARD: Admiral, this Maquis situation has you worried.

NECHAYEV: Believe me, Captain, if I were living that close to the

Cardassians, I'd keep a phaser under my pillow too. But in the last

weeks we've seen signs that the Maquis are moving beyond self-defence.

Their ranks are growing.

They're acquiring ships, weapons. They seem to be preparing for a more

aggressive military posture. We've got to put a stop to them before the

entire Demilitarised Zone ignites. But before we stop them, we have to

find them. They seem to be scattered in small cells around the Zone.

And we don't have reliable intelligence about any of them.

PICARD: Perhaps you need an undercover operative.

NECHAYEV: Our thinking exactly. We intend to infiltrate their

organisation, and the person we want to do it is aboard your ship right

now.

[Ro's quarters]

RO: Starfleet wants me to infiltrate the Maquis?

PICARD: Because of your recent training, because you're Bajoran, and

because of your past troubles with Starfleet gives you a certain

credibility.

RO: Well, that's certainly true. And just how soon would this mission

begin?

PICARD: Immediately.

RO: I see. I've spent the better part of my life fighting the

Cardassians. I never thought I'd be helping them out.

PICARD: This is a rare case when our interests and theirs coincide. We

both want peace in the Demilitarised Zone.

RO: I've heard a lot about the Maquis. One of my instructors at

Tactical Training, a Lieutenant Commander in Starfleet, a man I admired

and respected, he was sympathetic to them. He resigned and left to join

them.

PICARD: We're all sympathetic, Lieutenant. Our civilian population in

the Demilitarised Zone is in a very difficult situation, but even

sympathy has to end at some point. The peace treaty isn't just a piece

of paper. If the Maquis force us into a war with Cardassia, it could

mean hundreds of thousands of lives. Two years ago, Starfleet would

never have tapped you for this mission. They must have a lot of

confidence in you now.

RO: The way I see it, there's one good reason to take this mission, and

that's to validate your faith in me.

[Alien bar]

(mostly humanoid, a Vulcan, a Klingon. Ro, in

civilian clothes enters and sits at a table. Worf and Data enter in

uniform, so she grabs the man at the table and kisses him)

WORF: We are looking for a Bajoran woman, dark hair.

DATA: She is responsible for the death of a Cardassian soldier.

WORF: If we learn that she has been here, this establishment will be

closed down.

SANTOS: You say she had dark hair?

WORF: Yes.

SANTOS: She was here. You just missed her.

DATA: Do you know where she went?

SANTOS: No.

(Worf and Data leave, and Ro stops kissing the man. He's disappointed.)

RO: It was really nice meeting you.

(Ro goes to the bar)

RO: Thanks.

SANTOS: So, did you kill that Cardassian?

RO: Starfleet thinks I did. That's reason enough to hide. Why did you

tell them that I'd left?

SANTOS: There are worse things a person can do than kill a Cardassian

soldier.

RO: You don't often meet someone willing to say that out loud.

SANTOS: In the Zone, there are a lot of us who feel that way.

RO: I'd like to meet people like that.

(Santos shoots her)

[Room]

MACIAS: (middle aged man) Don't be afraid. You're

not in danger here.

SANTOS: What is your name?

KALITA: Did you kill that Cardassian soldier?

RO: Who are you?

SANTOS: We're the people who saved you from Starfleet.

RO: Thanks, but I'll be going now.

(Kalita points a weapon at Ro)

SANTOS: Did you kill that Cardassian?

RO: Yes.

KALITA: That's a risky thing to do in the Demilitarised Zone. You can

end up being hunted by Starfleet and the Cardassians.

RO: Then why did he risk bringing me here?

KALITA: We're asking the questions. Who are you?

RO: My name is Ro Laren. I grew up in the Bajoran camps.

MACIAS: That would explain why you have no love for Cardassians.

RO: I know what they're capable of. They tortured my father to death

and I was forced to watch.

SANTOS: Where are you living now?

RO: Nowhere. I was a Starfleet officer, but I was court-martialled and

sent to the stockade on Jaros Two. I'm not exactly what you'd call

Starfleet material.

SANTOS: When were you on Jaros?

RO: What difference does it make?

KALITA: We want to check your story. When were you there?

RO: Starfleet let me out about three years ago because I agreed to do

some work for them, mostly having to do with Bajor. But I got tired of

watching them placate the Cardassians, and so I left.

KALITA: You resigned?

RO: Not officially. That's part of the reason why they're looking for

me.

SANTOS: What were you doing on Omara?

RO: Look, I think I've answered enough of your questions. I would like

to know who you people are.

MACIAS: Let's say that we sympathise with those who oppose Cardassia.

RO: Are you Maquis?

MACIAS: What if we were?

RO: If you were, I would ask if I could join you and help you fight.

MACIAS: We'll check your story. Go ahead, I'll keep an eye on her.

(Kalita hands over the weapon then she and Santos leave. Macias puts

the gun on his chair)

MACIAS: Come, let's stretch our legs.

[Settlement]

(it's evening and the crickets are singing)

RO: Aren't you taking a chance by letting me see all of this? What if

my story doesn't check out? What if I'm not who I say I am?

MACIAS: Well, then we'll have a problem, won't we?

RO: You are Maquis, aren't you?

MACIAS: Many of the people here are.

RO: Starfleet considers you outlaws. They're afraid you'll destroy the

peace treaty.

MACIAS: They don't understand the situation here in the Zone. I lived

on Juhraya. When the treaty was signed the colony suddenly found itself

in Cardassian territory. Some of us chose to stay, take our chances.

Then one night I was dragged from my bed and beaten. The authorities

clucked their tongues and agreed it was an unfortunate incident, and

did nothing.

RO: I'm not surprised. The Cardassians intend to make life so

unpleasant for Federation citizens that they'll leave.

MACIAS: Exactly. And no one seems to see that, except the Maquis. How

old were you when your father was killed?

RO: I'd rather not talk about it.

MACIAS: Hungry? Would you like something?

RO: No, thank you.

MACIAS: (to replicator) Hasperat.

RO: You like hasperat?

MACIAS: An old Bajoran friend of mine used to make it. His was

stronger. He was killed many years ago fighting the Cardassian

occupation of Bajor. I miss his company, and his hasperat.

RO: My father used to make the strongest hasperat you've ever tasted.

Everything else seems mild by comparison.

MACIAS: Did he teach you how to make it?

RO: Yes. But I haven't tried it in years.

MACIAS: If you would make the brine for a really strong hasperat. I

mean eye watering, tongue searing strong, you'd make an old man very

happy.

RO: I would enjoy making it again.

SANTOS: Macias. I've checked with my sources at Starfleet. Her story's

true.

MACIAS: I was sure it was. Kalita, she'll stay with you until we can

find her a room.

[Meeting room]

MACIAS: Ah there you are.

KALITA: We've just heard a disturbing rumour.

RO: Another rumour?

KALITA: One that I think we should take seriously. A trader coming from

Pendi Two said he could verify that the Cardassians are going to start

supplying their colonists with biogenic weapons.

RO: I thought every shipment coming into the Zone was searched.

KALITA: The Cardassians always seem to find a way around problems like

that.

SANTOS: Then we have to make a preemptive strike. Send a message to the

Cardassians that we won't sit still while they kill us with toxins.

MACIAS: Agreed. But we can't mount a strike without medical supplies

and our stockpile is dangerously low.

KALITA: If we put in a request for more, it'll draw suspicion.

RO: I can get medical supplies. I served on the Enterprise. They always

have extra medkits on hand for relief missions.

SANTOS: You're wanted by Starfleet. They're not going to give you

medkits just because you ask for them.

RO: I have no intention of asking for them. I intend to take them.

KALITA: How? The Enterprise is a fortress.

RO: I know its security systems work. Give me a ship. I can do it.

SANTOS: It's madness.

KALITA: We can't let her do something like this. We don't know anything

about her.

MACIAS: I know that she can make very strong hasperat.

KALITA: What?

MACIAS: We need medical supplies. I think we should let her try.

KALITA: All right. But I'm going with her.

RO: I could use an extra hand at the controls. And a witness.

[Ro's ship]

RO: I set the transporter confinement parameters to

maximum. We should be able to fill our hold with medical supplies with

just one single beam out.

KALITA: I had no idea it was going to be so easy.

RO: We're approaching the Federation border.

KALITA: How do you plan to get out of the Demilitarised Zone without

being searched at one of the checkpoints?

RO: We're going to cross the border here.

KALITA: There are sensor buoys all along the border. If we cross

anywhere other than a checkpoint, Starfleet will send a ship to

investigate.

RO: With the right security codes, we can disable the proximity

detectors on the buoys.

KALITA: Starfleet changes those codes all the time.

RO: I know the encryption algorithms. If I can access the buoy's

protocol subsystem I should be able to figure out the codes.

KALITA: Should be able to?

RO: Do you want this mission to succeed?

KALITA: Of course I do. We need those medical supplies.

RO: In that case, let me do my job. I'm in.

KALITA: What's wrong?

RO: If I don't input the right code in the next twenty seconds, we'll

trigger the proximity alarm.

KALITA: I'm getting us out of sensor range.

RO: Don't. If we break the comm. link, we won't be able to try again.

RO: It worked. Until they change the access codes again, we can cross

the border here.

Captain's log, stardate 47943.2. It has been over a

week since Lieutenant Ro left the Enterprise. We have yet to receive

any communication from her.

[Bridge]

RIKER: We picked up a request for emergency

assistance from a Federation science ship in the Topin system.

PICARD: Are there any other ships in the vicinity?

RIKER: We're the closest.

PICARD: Helm, set course for the Topin system. Mister Data, will you

signal the science ship that we're on our way.

DATA: It is unlikely that they would receive our communication, sir.

The Topin system contains an unstable protostar. It generates

significant magnetoscopic interference.

PICARD: Can we use our sensors to find them?

DATA: Most of our sensors would be ineffective, although our

directional array should cut through the interference.

RIKER: That array has such a narrow scan field. We might as well break

out the palm beacons and try to find them that way.

[Ro's ship]

KALITA: This is insane. We're sitting here, no

sensors, blind to the outside, waiting for a galaxy class Starship to

come swooping down on us.

RO: Don't worry. It'll be hard for them to locate us with just the

directional sensors. Besides, they're looking for a damaged science

ship that wants to be found. They're here. Standby to engage thrusters.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Anything?

DATA: No, sir. It will take approximately six hours to scan this

system.

WORF: Captain, the distress call is being repeated.

PICARD: Data, can you locate the signal?

DATA: I am attempting to do so.

[Ro's ship]

KALITA: They're scanning our last position.

RO: All right, I've locked onto their sensor beam. I'm going to use it

to manoeuvre into transporter range.

KALITA: How are we going to beam through their shields?

RO: We can't. If we're going to get those medical supplies, we're going

to have to take this ship through their shields.

[Bridge]

DATA: Sir, I am scanning the area from which the

distress signal was sent, but I am unable to detect a vessel.

WORF: Captain, the computer has detected a piggyback communication on

the last distress signal.

PICARD: Can you decode it?

WORF: It will take a few moments.

PICARD: Do it.

[Ro's ship]

RO: The Enterprise shields have a weak point. When

the ship is at impulse, the thrust destabilises the shield

configuration right at this point. (between the nacelles) I'm going to

try to punch through there.

KALITA: Won't they detect us?

RO: They'll know something's penetrated the shields. With all the

interference it'll take them a few seconds to find us. We'll have to

beam the medical supplies aboard and get out fast.

[Bridge]

WORF: The message is difficult to decode.

Interference has garbled much of the transmission, but it seems to be

from Lieutenant Ro.

PICARD: Ro is on that ship?

DATA: Sir, a vessel of some kind is attempting to penetrate our aft

shields.

PICARD: Let it through.

[Ro's ship]

RO: We're going to make it. All right, we're in.

KALITA: Energising.

(their hold is filled up)

RO: Let's get out of here.

[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, a quantity of medical supplies was

beamed from cargo bay seven.

DATA: The vessel that penetrated our shields is of the same design as

the ships used by the Maquis. It is moving off.

PICARD: Let it go. There must be someone with her. We should make it

look as though we're trying to stop them. Mister Worf, lock phasers on

their previous position and fire.

WORF: Aye, sir.

RIKER: Now we know what they mean by Advanced Tactical Training.

[Settlement]

SANTOS: You took your ship through their shields?

KALITA: Ro parked us between their warp nacelles. I thought she was

crazy, but it worked. She knew exactly what she was doing.

MACIAS: Well done.

SANTOS: I have to inventory supplies and find out what we have.

KALITA: See you later.

(Santos and Kalita leave)

MACIAS: Well, it seems that Kalita has decided you're not a Federation

spy after all. She's suspicious of everyone at first. And rightly so.

We've learned to be cautious with strangers.

RO: I understand.

MACIAS: But I've known since I first met you that in your heart, you're

one of us.

Captain's log, supplemental. Having earned the

Maquis' trust with her raid on the Enterprise, Lieutenant Ro has been

given access to a ship and allowed to leave the settlement by herself.

[Observation lounge]

RO: There are rumours that the Cardassians are

supplying their colonists with biogenic weapons.

PICARD: Frankly, I find it hard to believe. Every ship that enters the

Demilitarised Zone is being searched.

RO: The Maquis are convinced that the Cardassians are finding a way

around these searches.

PICARD: You know, we could make use of that.

RO: Sir?

PICARD: We have come up with a plan that has the potential to seriously

curtail the Maquis. We want to give them a target so threatening to

them that they'll be willing to commit as many ships and people as

possible in order to destroy it.

RO: What do you mean, give them a target?

PICARD: Biogenic weapons, for example. You could provide them with

intelligence that would show that the Cardassians are, in fact,

supplying their colonists with them.

RO: That would get their attention, all right.

PICARD: You could tell them that in order to get past the check points,

they're shipping the components for these weapons through third

parties, and then we could put together a convoy and send it toward the

Demilitarised Zone.

RO: And when the Maquis attack it, Starfleet will be waiting for them.

PICARD: We could station our ships in the Hugora Nebula to avoid

detection.

RO: Basically, I would be leading them into a trap.

PICARD: That's right. If you have a problem with any of this, I need to

know it now.

RO: Well, if I do, sir, it will not stop me from carrying out my duty.

PICARD: I knew that I could count on you.

[Meeting Room]

RO: It took me a while, but I managed to patch

through into Starfleet's comm. system. I intercepted a communication

from one of the

checkpoints on the border. They're concerned because a Pakled transport

came through carrying retro-viral vaccines.

SANTOS: Why is that a concern?

RO: Well, last week a Ferengi transport came through carrying

biomimetic gels. By themselves, neither of these is dangerous, but

Starfleet is concerned because with along with other components the

Cardassians could put together a biogenic device.

KALITA: What is Starfleet going to do about it?

RO: They can't do anything about it. These items are all perfectly

legal.

MACIAS: How close are the Cardassians to having the components they

need?

RO: Very close. Two days ago, a Yridian convoy left Deep Space Nine for

the Demilitarised Zone. It's carrying isomiotic hypos, plasma flares

and quarantine pods.

KALITA: We can't let that convoy reach its destination.

SANTOS: But it's too big for us to go after alone.

MACIAS: I'll discuss the situation with the other cell leaders.

Considering what's at stake, they'll want to help.

[Settlement]

MACIAS: I've sent a communication to the others.

When this is over, we'll celebrate.

RO: When it's over?

MACIAS: When Cardassia realises they can't intimidate us into leaving

our colonies.

RO: Something tells me it'll be a long time before we'll be

celebrating.

MACIAS: Don't be discouraged, Ro. It'll take time, but the important

thing is that we not give up.

RO: I spent ten years in the camps. I don't give up.

MACIAS: I've been thinking a long time about what our celebration will

be like. We'll have a huge dinner. You'll make hasperat and I'll make

blueberry pie. We'll drink wine and we'll dance. I'll even play the

belaklavion. That'll give everyone a laugh.

RO: You play the klavion?

MACIAS: Yes, badly. It's a difficult instrument, but I enjoy the

challenge.

RO: My father played the klavion. When I was very young and afraid of

monsters under my bed, he'd play for me. He said that the klavion had

special powers. Monsters were afraid of it and when they heard it they

would disappear. When I listened to that music he played for me I was

never afraid to go to sleep. When he died I realised even he couldn't

make all the monsters go away.

MACIAS: Why wait? Let's go to the market. Let's get food for a feast,

for a celebration.

RO: A celebration of what?

MACIAS: Of absolutely nothing. Just to celebrate.

RO: I'd like that.

(they go walking off across the square and their dialogue is under the

music)

MACIAS: Come, let's go to the market. If I'm going to make a pie, we'll

have to find a substitute for blueberries. Haven't seen real ones in

years.

RO: On Bajor, there's a berry

MACIAS: Yes, I know it, very sweet.

(three cowled figures go up some steps then reveal themselves to be

Cardassians. They start shooting the people. Santos comes with weapons)

SANTOS: Ro!

(she takes one, and others get handed out. Santos kills one Cardassian,

Kalita another, then Macias goes to help a wounded man and gets shot

himself. Ro kills the last Cardassian)

RO: Macias?

MACIAS: They must have found out that there was a Maquis cell here.

RO: Kalita, get one of the medkits. Hurry. You have to hang on.

MACIAS: When an old fighter like me dies someone always steps forward

to take his place.

(and he dies)

[Alien bar]

(Picard is in civilian clothes and Ro enters. The

male she kissed approaches her.)

RO: Not tonight. (to Picard) Hello. Are you alone?

PICARD: I hope not.

RO: Why don't we get acquainted? There's a table in the back that's

more private.

PICARD: I'd like that.

(they sit and pretend to be getting close)

RO: We have to cancel the mission.

PICARD: Why?

RO: The Maquis didn't go for the bait. They think the convoy is too big

a target.

PICARD: But there are only six ships. We could even cut back that

number.

RO: It's the commitment of resources, of grouping so many of the Maquis

together at once. They feel that it makes them too vulnerable.

PICARD: Every intelligence report that I get from Starfleet suggests

that the Maquis are eager to expand their strikes, they want to

escalate their activities. Now you're telling me this isn't true?

RO: It's probably different in every cell. The people I've met tend to

be more conservative. I'm sure others have a more militant attitude.

PICARD: Laren, what's going on?

RO: Do you have the money I asked you to bring?

PICARD: Yes.

RO: Put some on the table.

PICARD: What?

RO: By this time, you should be negotiating my price. When you sent me

on this mission, I thought that I could do it. Even

though it meant helping Cardassians, even though it meant betraying

people who are fighting against them. Now I'm not sure where I stand.

PICARD: Are you saying you want to back out of this mission?

RO: Sir, I don't want to let you down, I swear that I don't.

PICARD: This has nothing to do with me. This is about you. If you back

out now, you'll throw away everything you've worked for. We're

committed to this mission. My only question for you is, can you carry

out your orders? I could put you before a board of inquiry for having

lied to me about this operation. I would certainly have you

court-martialled if you sabotage it. Now, it's your decision.

RO: I'll carry out my orders, sir.

PICARD: I feel it necessary to have Commander Riker go back with you.

He can pose as a relative. I just want to make sure that nothing

happens to obstruct this mission.

(Picard stands to leave)

PICARD: I'm sorry. I don't have that kind of money.

Captain's log, supplemental. We have received word

from Commander Riker and Lieutenant Ro that the Maquis will be

attacking the convoy as planned. Our ships have taken up position in

the Hugora Nebula to wait for them.

[Bridge]

(at the science station)

DATA: I have established a relay link with the sensor probe we left on

the perimeter of the Nebula. This is the convoy. We are expecting the

Maquis attack force to cross the border from the Demilitarised Zone.

PICARD: As soon as they cross the border, we'll intercept them.

WORF: Captain, in order to ensure that the ship Commander Riker and

Lieutenant Ro are piloting does not come under fire, I have relayed

their warp signature to the rest of the attack force.

DATA: Sir, the Maquis squadron is coming into sensor range.

PICARD: Go to Red alert.

WORF: Aye, sir.

[Ro's ship]

 SANTOS [OC]: Squad leader to all ships.

RO: Go ahead, squad leader.

[Santos' ship]

SANTOS: We'll be crossing the border in less than

one minute. Arm your weapons.

RO [OC]: Acknowledged.

[Ro's ship]

RIKER: Starfleet can't make its move until we're

out of the Demilitarised Zone. We're to break formation and take cover

in the Nebula as soon as they appear.

RO: The ships in the convoy are raising their shields. They've spotted

us.

RIKER: We cross the border in thirty seconds.

(Ro presses some buttons)

RIKER: What the?

(Ro aims her phaser at him)

RO: I'm sorry. I can't let this happen.

[Bridge]

DATA: Sir, the vessel being piloted by Lieutenant

Ro is firing a low intensity particle beam into the nebula.

PICARD: What the hell is she doing?

DATA: The polarising effect being created by the beam may make it

possible for us to be detected.

PICARD: Can you counter the effect?

DATA: I will attempt to do so.

[Santos's ship]

SANTOS: Ro, why are you firing?

RO [OC]: Scan the nebula.

[Ro's ship]

RO: There's a Starfleet attack force hiding inside

it.

[Santos' ship]

SANTOS: I see it! Squad leader to all ships. Abort

the mission. Repeat, abort the mission.

[Bridge]

DATA: Sir, the Maquis ships are breaking formation.

PICARD: Have they crossed the border?

DATA: No, sir. They are withdrawing.

WORF: Captain, Lieutenant Ro's ship is not retreating with the others.

It is heading toward us.

PICARD: When she comes aboard take her into custody.

[Ro's ship]

RO: Alpha Seven to Alpha Nine.

KALITA [OC]: Go ahead.

RO: Stand by to beam me aboard.

KALITA [OC]: Standing by.

RO: You can take this ship back to the Enterprise.

RIKER: You're going with them?

RO: It's been a long time since I really felt like I really belonged

somewhere. Could you tell Captain Picard something for me?

RIKER: Of course. What is it?

RO: Tell him I'm sorry.

RIKER: So long, Ro. Take care of yourself.

RO: Goodbye, Will. Energise.

[Ready room]

RIKER: She seemed very sure that she was making the

right choice. I think her only real regret was that she let you down.

Here's my report.

(Picard doesn't move to take the PADD, so Riker puts it on the desk and

leaves)

Good Things

Stardate:

47988

Original Airdate: 23 May, 1994

  [Corridor]

TROI: That was an incredible programme.

WORF: I am glad you approve. I have always found the Black Sea at night

to be a most stimulating experience.

TROI: Worf, we were walking barefoot on the beach with balalaika music

in the air, ocean breeze washing over us, stars in the sky, a full moon

rising, and the most you can say is stimulating?

WORF: It was very stimulating.

(the turbolift arrives as Troi rolls her eyes)

WORF: What?

(exiting the turbolift into another corridor)

TROI: You know, I don't spend nearly enough time on the holodeck. I

should take my own advice and go there to relax. Next time I'll choose

the programme. If you like the Black Sea, you're going to love Lake

Cataria on Betazed.

WORF: Deanna, perhaps before there is a next time, we should discuss

Commander Riker.

TROI: Why, is he coming along?

WORF: No, but I do not wish. I mean, it would be unfortunate if he. If

you and I are going to continue, I do not wish to hurt his feelings.

TROI: Worf, I think it's all right to concentrate on our feelings,

yours and mine.

(they're about to kiss when)

PICARD: (in dressing gown) Counsellor! What's today's date? The date!

WORF: Stardate 47988.

PICARD: 47988.

TROI: Captain, what's wrong?

PICARD: 47988. I'm not sure. I don't know how or why, but I'm moving

back and forth through time.

[Troi's quarters]

PICARD: I had this feeling I had physically left

the Enterprise. I was in another time, another place. I was somewhere

in the past.

TROI: Can you describe where you were, what it looked like?

PICARD: You see, it's all slipping away so fast. It's like waking up

from a nightmare. It was years ago. It was before I took command of the

Enterprise. I was talking to someone, I can't remember who. And then it

all changed. I was no longer in the past. I was now an old man in the

future, and I was outside and I was doing something. I can't remember

what it was. I'm sorry, it's all gone. I just can't remember.

TROI: It's all right. Have you considered the possibility that this was

just a dream?

PICARD: No, no, it was much more than a dream. The smells, the sounds,

the very touch of things, much more real than a dream.

TROI: How long did you spend in each time period? Did it seem like

minutes, hours?

PICARD: You see, I can't say. At first I had a sense of confusion,

disorientation. I wasn't sure where I was. And then all that passed and

it all seemed perfectly natural, as though I belonged in that time. But

I can't

[Future Vineyard]

(Picard is bearded and working outside on a grape

vine. He looks around for a moment then carries on tying them onto

their supports.)

LAFORGE: Captain Picard to the Bridge! Captain, we've got a problem

with the warp core, or the phase inducers, or some other damn thing.

PICARD: Geordi.

(They embrace. Geordi has blue eyes and grey in his hair)

LAFORGE: Hello, Captain or should I call you Ambassador?

PICARD: Oh, I haven't been called that for some time either.

LAFORGE: How about Mister Picard?

PICARD: How about Jean-Luc?

LAFORGE: I don't think I could get used to that.

PICARD: Good Lord, Geordi. Well, how long has it been?

LAFORGE: Nine years.

PICARD: No, no, no. Since you last called me Captain, since we were all

together on the Enterprise?

LAFORGE: Close to twenty five years.

PICARD: Twenty five years. Well, time has been good to you.

LAFORGE: IA little too good to me in some places. Can I give you a hand

here?

PICARD: Oh, well, I'm just tying up some vines.

LAFORGE: You've got leaf miners. You might want to use a bacillus

spray. My wife is quite a gardener. I've picked up a little bit of it.

PICARD: How is Leah?

LAFORGE: Just wonderful. Busy as ever. She's just been made director of

the Daystrom Institute.

PICARD: What about the little ones, Brett, Alandra and er?

LAFORGE: Sidney.

PICARD: Sidney.

LAFORGE: Well, they're not so little any more. Brett is applying to

Starfleet Academy next year.

PICARD: So what brings you here?

LAFORGE: Oh I just thought I'd stop by. Been thinking about the old

days on the Enterprise. I was in the neighbourhood.

PICARD: Geordi, you don't make the trip from Rigel Three to Earth just

to drop by.

LAFORGE: No.

PICARD: So, you've heard?

LAFORGE: Leah's got a few friends at Starfleet Medical. Word gets

around.

PICARD: I'm not an invalid. Irumodic Syndrome can take years to run its

course.

LAFORGE: I know. Once I heard, well, I just wanted to stop by just the

same.

PICARD: Well now that you're here, you can help me carry those tools.

Well, my cooking may not be up to Leah's

standards, but I can still make a decent cup of tea. Oh, I read your

last novel. I thought that the protagonist a little too flamboyant, but

for the rest I

(he sees three tatty people jeering at him)

LAFORGE: Captain, are you all right? Captain!

TASHA [OC]: Captain?

[Past - Shuttlecraft]

(We're back to season one now)

TASHA: Will this be your first time on a Galaxy class starship? Are you

all right, sir? Sir?

PICARD: I'm sorry, Lieutenant. My mind must have wandered. What were

you saying?

TASHA: I was asking if you'd ever been aboard a Galaxy class starship

before.

PICARD: No. Of course, I'm familiar with the blueprints and

specifications, but this will be my first time aboard.

TASHA: Well then, if I may be so bold, sir, you're in for a treat. The

Enterprise is quite a ship.

PICARD: I'm sure she is.

TASHA: Have I done something wrong, sir?

PICARD: No. It's just that you look very familiar.

CREWMAN [OC]: Enterprise to shuttlecraft Galileo. You are cleared for

arrival in shuttlebay two.

TASHA: Acknowledged, Enterprise. And there she is.

(and we get a nice look at Enterprise in her spacedock)

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Captain? Captain?

PICARD: Tasha. I was just with Tasha in the shuttle.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: I've finished the neurographic scan. I

don't see anything that might cause hallucinations or a psychogenic

reaction.

TROI: Is there any indication of temporal displacement?

CRUSHER: No. Usually a temporal shift would leave some kind of

triptamine residue in the cerebral cortex, but the scan didn't show

any. Personally, I think you just enjoy waking everybody up in the

middle of the night.

PICARD: Actually, I really like running around the ship in my bare

feet.

OGAWA: (visibly pregnant) The biospectral test results, Doctor.

CRUSHER: Your blood gas analysis is consistent with someone who's been

breathing the ship's air for weeks. If you'd been somewhere else, there

would be an indication of change in the oxygen isotope ratios. Thanks.

Deanna, would you excuse us please?

TROI: Of course.

(Troi leaves)

CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, I scanned for evidence of Irumodic Syndrome, as you

suggested. There wasn't any. But I did find a small structural defect

in the parietal lobe.

PICARD: A defect that you hadn't noticed before?

CRUSHER: It's the kind of defect that would only show up on a level

four neurographic scan. It could cause you to be susceptible to several

kinds of neurological disorders including Irumodic Syndrome. Now, it's

possible for you to live with this defect for the rest of your life

without developing a problem. Or even if you do, many people continue

to live normal lives for a long time after the onset of Irumodic

Syndrome.

PICARD: If that's so, why do you look like you've just signed my death

sentence?

CRUSHER: I'm sorry. I guess it caught me off guard.

PICARD: I wouldn't worry about it. Something tells me that you're going

to have to put up with me for a long time to come.

CRUSHER: Well, it won't be easy, but I'll manage.

(Riker enters)

RIKER: Captain.

PICARD: Has Worf found anything?

RIKER: No, sir. His security scans came up negative. They're still

checking the sensor logs but there is no indication that you ever left

the ship.

PICARD: I wasn't dreaming. Something happened.

WORF [OC]: Worf to Captain.

PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Worf.

WORF: Sir, there is an incoming transmission from Admiral Nakamura. It

is a priority one message.

PICARD: Beverly? Mister Worf, will you route the call through to Doctor

Crusher's office.

WORF: Aye, sir.

[Crusher's office]

NAKAMURA [on monitor]: Captain.

PICARD: Admiral.

NAKAMURA [on monitor]: I am initiating a fleet-wide Yellow Alert.

Starfleet intelligence has picked up some alarming reports from the

Romulan Empire. It appears that at least thirty Warbirds have been

pulled from other assignments and are headed for the Neutral Zone.

PICARD: Is there any explanation why they would make such a blatantly

aggressive move?

NAKAMURA [on monitor]: Our operatives on Romulus have indicated that

there appears to be something happening in the Neutral Zone,

specifically in the Devron System. Our own long range scans have picked

up some kind of spatial anomaly in the area. We can't tell what it is.

PICARD: What are our orders?

NAKAMURA [on monitor]: This is a very delicate situation. I am

deploying fifteen starships along our side of the Neutral Zone. I want

you to go there as well. See if you can find out what is going on in

the Devron System.

PICARD: Am I authorised to enter the Neutral Zone?

NAKAMURA [on monitor]: Not yet. Wait and see what the Romulans do. You

can conduct long range scans, send probes if necessary, but do not

cross the border unless they do.

PICARD: Understood.

NAKAMURA [on monitor]: Starfleet out.

[Future Vineyard]

LAFORGE: Captain. What's wrong?

PICARD: This is not my time. I don't belong here.

LAFORGE: What?

PICARD: I was somewhere else a few moments ago.

LAFORGE: What do you mean? You've been right here with me.

PICARD: No, no, no! I was somewhere else. I was, it was a long time

ago. There was someone talking. I was talking to someone. Beverly. I

was talking to Beverly.

LAFORGE: It's okay, Captain. Everything's going to be all right.

PICARD: I'm not senile, you know. This did happen. I was here, I was

talking to you, and then I was somewhere else. I was on the Enterprise.

I was back on the Enterprise. At least, I think that's where it was. I

was in Sickbay. Well, it might have been a hospital.

LAFORGE: Captain, I think we should go back to the house and call your

doctor

PICARD: Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking. It's the Irumodic

Syndrome. He's beginning to lose his mind, the old man. Well, it's not

that. And I'm not daydreaming either.

LAFORGE: Well, all right. All right. So, what do you want do about it?

PICARD: Data. I want to see Data.

LAFORGE: Data? Why?

PICARD: Because I think he can help.

LAFORGE: Help how?

PICARD: I don't know! I don't know! I want to see Data!

LAFORGE: Okay, then, all right, let's go see Data. He's still at

Cambridge, isn't he?

PICARD: Yes, I think he is.

(six tatty humans jeering)

PICARD: You see them, don't you?

LAFORGE: See who?

PICARD: They're everywhere. They're laughing at me. Why are they

laughing?

LAFORGE: Come on, Captain. Let's go see Data.

PICARD: Yes, Data. We'll go see Data.

[Future Cambridge University - Data's

library]

(a roaring fire, plenty of cats and an obviously

fake streak of white in his hair)

PICARD: I know how it sounds but it happened. It was real. I was there,

back on board the Enterprise.

JESSEL: (cod English housekeeper) How do you like your tea?

PICARD: Tea? Earl Grey. Hot.

JESSEL: Course it's hot. What do you want in it?

PICARD: Nothing. Well, Data, I must say, this is a fine place you have

here. They certainly treat professors pretty well at Cambridge

DATA: Holding the Lucasian Chair does have its perquisites. This house

originally belonged to Sir Isaac Newton when he held the position. It's

become the traditional residence.

JESSEL: Here you go.

LAFORGE: Thank you.

JESSEL: If you're really his friend, you'll get him to take that grey

out of his hair. Looks like a bloody skunk.

DATA: Jessel. She can be frightfully trying at times, but she does make

me laugh.

LAFORGE: Data, what is it with the hair anyway?

DATA: I found that a touch of grey adds an air of distinction.

PICARD: You say this is Earl Grey? I'd swear that it was Darjeeling.

(Jessel leaves)

DATA: Captain, how long has it been since you've seen a physician about

your Irumodic Syndrome?

PICARD: A week. They've prescribed peridaxon.

DATA: But sir, peridaxon

PICARD: Yes, I know, it's not a cure, There's nothing that can prevent

the deterioration of the synaptic pathways. You think that I'm senile,

that all this is just a delusion.

LAFORGE: Now come on, Captain, no one said anything of the kind.

DATA: In all honesty, Captain, the thought has occurred to me. However,

there's nothing to disprove what you're saying. So it's possible

something is happening to you. The first thing we should do is run a

complete series of neurographic scans. We can use the equipment at the

biometrics lab here on the campus. Jessel, ask Professor Ripper to take

over my lecture for tomorrow. Possibly for the rest of the week.

Captain, we'll get to the bottom of this.

PICARD: That's the Data that I remember. I knew I could count on you.

[Past Shuttlebay]

TASHA: Commanding officer Enterprise arriving.

(Picard is piped aboard. Troi is back in her mini-uniform but not the

bun.)

PICARD: To Captain Jean-Luc Picard, stardate 41148

(three people jeering from the upper level)

PICARD: You are hereby requested and required to take command

(four of them behind him)

PICARD: to take command of the USS Enterprise as of this date. Signed

Rear Admiral Norah Satie, Starfleet Command.

(just as he goes to shake Troi's hand, he sees more)

PICARD: Red Alert! All crew to battle stations.

(Guy Vardeman, Colm Meaney and the others hesitate)

TASHA: You heard him. Move!

Personal log, stardate 41153.7. Recorded under

security lockout Omega three two seven. I have decided not to inform

this crew of my experiences. If it's true that I've travelled to the

past, I cannot risk giving them foreknowledge of what's to come.

[Past - Observation lounge]

PICARD: Report.

TASHA: We've completed a full subspace scan of the ship and surrounding

space. We've detected no unusual readings or anomalies.

WORF: With all due respect, sir, it would be helpful if we knew exactly

what we were looking for.

PICARD: Noted. Counsellor, do you sense anything unusual on board the

Enterprise? Perhaps an alien presence that doesn't

belong here, maybe one operating on a level of intelligence far

superior to our own?

TROI: No, sir. I'm only aware of the crew and the families on board the

ship.

PICARD: Mister Worf, initiate a level two security alert on all decks

until further notice.

TASHA: With all due respect, sir, I'm the Security Chief on this ship.

Unless you're planning to make a change.

PICARD: No, of course not. Lieutenant, security alert two.

TASHA: Aye, sir.

O'BRIEN [OC]: Captain Picard to the Bridge, please.

PICARD: We're on our way, Chief.

[Past - Bridge]

O'BRIEN: Sir, Starfleet has just issued an alert.

It appears a number of vessels are moving toward the Neutral Zone

between Romulan and Federation space.

TASHA: What kind of vessels?

O'BRIEN: Freighters, transports, all civilians. None of them Starfleet

ships.

PICARD: This tells me that a large spatial anomaly has appeared in the

Neutral Zone, in the Devron System.

WORF: Captain, it could be a Romulan trick to lure our ships into the

Neutral Zone as an excuse for a military strike.

O'BRIEN: Starfleet's cancelling our mission to Farpoint Station and

ordering us to the Neutral Zone as soon as we leave the Spacedock.

PICARD: No, we'll proceed to Farpoint.

TASHA: Sir?

PICARD: You heard me.

WORF: Captain, the security of the Federation could be at stake.

PICARD: Mister Worf, will you man your station.

WORF: Aye, sir.

TROI: Captain, perhaps if we understood your thinking, if you could

explain

PICARD: I've no intention of explaining to anyone. We will proceed with

our mission to Farpoint as planned. Chief O'Brien, am I right in

thinking that you're having a problem with the warp plasma inducers.

O'BRIEN: That's right, sir.

PICARD: Well I know how to get them back online. You're with me. We'll

be in main Engineering.

[Past - Engineering]

PICARD: Mister O'Brien, will you use these

specifications to bypass the secondary plasma inducer.

O'BRIEN: You have to realise sir, this isn't exactly my area of

expertise. The Chief Engineer should be making these modifications.

PICARD: But the Chief Engineer isn't on board. Mister O'Brien, trust

me. I know you can do it. All those years you spent as a child building

those model starship engines. They were well worth it.

O'BRIEN: How did you know that, sir?

PICARD: From your Starfleet records.

O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. I'll get right to these modifications. Fletcher,

tell Munoz and Lee to get up here right away.

FLETCHER: Aye, sir.

(Picard goes to a wall console and Data enters)

O'BRIEN: We have to realign the entire power grid. We'll all be burning

the midnight oil on this one.

DATA: That would be inadvisable.

O'BRIEN: Excuse me?

DATA: If you attempt to ignite a petroleum product on this ship at zero

hundred hours, it will activate the fire suppression system, which

would seal off this entire compartment.

O'BRIEN: That was just an expression.

DATA: Expression of what?

O'BRIEN: A figure of speech. I was trying to tell him that we'd be

working late.

DATA: Ah. Then to burn the midnight oil implies late work?

O'BRIEN: That's right.

DATA: I am curious. What is the etymology of that idiom? How did it

come to be used in contemporary language?

O'BRIEN: I don't know, sir.

PICARD: Commander Data, welcome on board. It's so very good to see you.

DATA: It is good to see you, too, sir.

PICARD: I could use your help with the infuser array.

DATA: Certainly.

PICARD: As you can see, we're having difficulty with the plasma

conduits.

DATA: This will need a completely new field induction subprocessor. It

appears that we will be required to ignite the midnight petroleum, sir.

CRUSHER [OC]: Jean-Luc, what's going on?

[Doctor's office]

PICARD: It happened again.

CRUSHER: A time shift?

PICARD: Yes.

RIKER: What happened?

PICARD: It's still a little vague, but I can remember more this time.

It seems that every time I shift periods, I can retain more memory. At

first, it appeared that I was in the future, years from now, and then I

was in the past just before our first mission.

RIKER: What is it?

CRUSHER: I just scanned his temporal lobe and compared it to the scan I

performed just a few minutes before. There's a thirteen percent

increase in the acetylcholine of the hippocampus. Within a matter of

minutes, you have accumulated over two days worth of memories.

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: Counsellor, do you remember when I first

came on board the Enterprise?

TROI: Yes.

PICARD: What happened after the welcoming ceremony?

TROI: There was a reception in Ten Forward. I introduced you to Worf

and the other senior officers.

PICARD: Do you have any memory of my calling Red Alert in Spacedock? Do

you remember Starfleet diverting us from Farpoint to the Neutral Zone

to investigate a spatial anomaly?

TROI: No.

DATA: It would appear there is a discontinuity between the time periods

you described. Events in one time period would seem to have no effect

on the other two.

RIKER: And yet in both the past and the present there's a report of the

same anomaly in the Devron System. I find it hard to believe that

that's a coincidence.

PICARD: For all I know, I may find the same thing in the future.

LAFORGE: Perhaps the anomaly is a temporal disturbance of some kind.

CRUSHER: How is all this related to your time shifting?

PICARD: These are all very important questions, and perhaps I will find

answers to them in the past, but now we have a potentially dangerous

threat from the Romulans. I want all departments to present a battle

readiness report to me at oh eight hundred hours tomorrow morning.

Dismissed.

RIKER: Deanna, it's going to be a late night. Would you like to have

some dinner first?

TROI: Actually I, we have plans.

RIKER: Oh. I see. I'm sorry. I'll see you in the morning.

WORF: Goodnight, sir.

RIKER: Worf.

[Bridge]

PICARD: I want continuous subspace sweeps. We may

be able to detect a temporal disturbance.

DATA: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Will, this time shifting. When it happens I experience a

momentary disorientation. If that should happen during a crisis, I want

you to take command immediately. Number One?

RIKER: I'm sorry. Be prepared to take command. Aye, sir.

PICARD: Speaking of disorientation, are you all right?

RIKER: I'm just a little distracted. I'm fine.

PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. I'll be in my Ready room.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come.

CRUSHER: Milk, warm, a dash of nutmeg.

PICARD: What's this?

CRUSHER: A prescription. A glass of warm milk and eight hours

uninterrupted sleep.

PICARD: Beverly.

CRUSHER: Doctor's orders. You're exhausted. Look, I don't know whether

you've slept in the past or in the future, but I'm sure you haven't

slept in the present. Now get some rest, or I'll have you relieved and

sedated.

PICARD: Yes, sir. What? Hey, Beverly?

CRUSHER: As a physician, it's often my job to give people unpleasant

news. To tell them that they need surgery or that they can't have

children or that they might be facing a difficult illness.

PICARD: But you said yourself that this is only a possibility.

CRUSHER: But you've been to the future. You know it's going to happen.

PICARD: I prefer to look on the future as something which is not

written in stone. A lot of things can happen in twenty five years.

(they kiss)

CRUSHER: A lot of things can happen.

LAFORGE [OC]: Captain?

[Future - Data's library]

LAFORGE: Captain, wake up.

PICARD: Yes. What is it? Have we reached the Neutral Zone?

LAFORGE: The Neutral Zone?

PICARD: Sorry. I was in the past again. What's going on?

LAFORGE: Data's arranged for us to run those tests on you in the

biometrics lab. We're ready to go if you are.

PICARD: No, no, no. No, we have to get to the Neutral Zone.

LAFORGE: The Neutral Zone? Why?

PICARD: In the other two time periods, Starfleet reported a sort of a

spatial anomaly in, in, in the Devron system. In Devron system in the

Neutral Zone.

LAFORGE: Captain.

PICARD: If the anomaly appeared there in the past, then it might be

here too and we have to find out.

LAFORGE: Just because you've seen it in two other time frames, doesn't

mean that it's going to be here.

PICARD: But if it is here, then it means something. Damn it, Geordi, I

know what we have to do!

LAFORGE: All right. Okay. But first, there is no Neutral Zone,

remember?

PICARD: Right. Right. Klingons. In this time period, the Klingons have

taken over the Romulan Empire.

LAFORGE: Right now relations between us and the Klingons aren't too

cosy.

PICARD: I know that. I haven't completely lost my mind, you know.

LAFORGE: Well, if we're going to the Devron system, we're going to need

a ship.

PICARD: Right. Now, I think it's time to call in some old favours.

Contact Admiral Riker, Starbase two four seven.

(later)

RIKER [on viewscreen]: Jean-Luc, you know I'd like to help, but

frankly, what you're asking for is impossible. The Klingons have closed

their borders to all Federation starships.

PICARD: Will, if this spatial anomaly really is in the Devron System.

RIKER [on viewscreen]: I saw a report from Starfleet Intelligence this

morning on that sector. There is no activity. There is nothing unusual

going on in the Devron system.

PICARD: Well I don't believe it! What if their long range scanners are

faulty? We have to go there and see for ourselves.

RIKER [on viewscreen]: Look, I've got the Yorktown out near the border.

I'll have her run some long range scans in the Devron System. If she

finds out anything, I'll let you know.

PICARD: Will, that is just not good enough.

RIKER [on viewscreen]: It's going to have to be. I'm sorry. It's all I

can do. Riker out.

DATA: Computer, restore holographic image.

(back comes the fireplace)

PICARD: Damn him, anyway. After all we've been through together. He's

been sitting behind that desk too long.

LAFORGE: Captain, I'm sorry. I guess all we can do now is wait and see

if the Yorktown finds anything.

DATA: There is another option. We could arrange passage aboard a

medical ship.

PICARD: Medical ship?

DATA: Yes, sir. There was an outbreak of Terrellian plague on Romulus.

The Klingons have been allowing Federation medical ships to cross the

border.

PICARD: Yes. Yes!

LAFORGE: So, What we need is a medical ship.

PICARD: I think I can arrange that. Data, find the USS Pasteur. I have

some pull with the Captain. At least, I used to have.

[Future - USS Pasteur Bridge]

(Captained by Beverly Picard)

CRUSHER: (to Data and Geordi) Well, this is a page from the past. I

never thought I'd see either of you on a starship again.

LAFORGE: Hello, Doctor.

CRUSHER: Geordi.

DATA: Doctor.

CRUSHER: Data.

(then she goes to Picard and they can't decide whether to shake or hug)

PICARD: Let's just choose one.

CRUSHER: All right.

(they hug)

PICARD: So, did you get my message?

CRUSHER: Yes. Jean-Luc, crossing into Klingon territory. It's absurd.

But then I never could say no to you.

PICARD: Oh. So that's why you married me.

CRUSHER: Well now, the first order of business is to get clearance to

cross the Klingon border.

LAFORGE: Agreed. What about Worf?

PICARD: Yes, that's it. Worf. Yes, that's the answer. Worf will help us.

LAFORGE: Data, isn't Worf still a member of the Klingon High Council?

DATA: I'm not sure. Information on the Klingon political structure is

hard to come by these days. However, at last report Worf was governor

of H'atoria, a small Klingon colony near the border.

CHILTON: Captain Picard?

PICARD + CRUSHER: Yes?

CHILTON: Captain, McKinley Station is signalling. They want to know

when we'll be docking.

CRUSHER: Tell McKinley we've been called away on a priority mission.

CHILTON: Aye, sir.

PICARD: So, you kept the name.

CRUSHER: I've prepared quarters for you on deck five. You might want to

get some rest.

PICARD: No, I'm fine. I don't need rest.

CRUSHER: Nell, please escort the Ambassador to his quarters.

PICARD: Look, you are treating me as if I am an invalid. I do have a

few years left in me yet. I do not want to be led around, and I do not

want to be patronised.

CRUSHER: You're right. I'm sorry.

PICARD: Now, I'll go and get some rest.

(Picard leaves)

CRUSHER: How long since his last neurological scan?

LAFORGE: I'm not sure, but I wouldn't try suggesting it. He says he's

not taking any more damn tests.

CRUSHER: Do you really think he's moving through time? (silence) I'm

not sure I do either. But he's Jean-Luc Picard and if he wants to go on

one more mission, that's what we're going to do.

[Future - Pasteur turbolift]

PICARD: We'll find the anomaly. I know we will.

(and steps out into)

[Past - Bridge]

PICARD: Report.

O'BRIEN: We're nearing the coordinates you gave me, sir.

PICARD: Is there anything unusual in the vicinity, Mister Data?

DATA: How would you define unusual, sir? Every region of space has its

own unique properties that cannot be found anywhere else.

PICARD: There should be a barrier of some sort nearby. A large plasma

field, highly disruptive.

DATA: Nothing, sir.

PICARD: This is the right time, the right place. He should be here now.

O'BRIEN: Who, sir?

PICARD: Q! We're here! This has gone on long enough! Counsellor, do you

sense an alien presence?

TROI: No, sir.

WORF: What is a Q?

TASHA: It's a letter of the alphabet, as far as I know.

PICARD: I don't understand. This is not the way it's supposed to

happen. Maintain this position. I'll be in my Ready room.

[Courtroom]

(but instead of the Ready room he walks into the

courtroom from Encounter at Farpoint wearing his season 7 uniform)

Q: Mon capitane. I thought you'd never get here.

PICARD: Q. I knew it. What's going on?

Q: It's Judge Q to you. And isn't it obvious what's going on?

PICARD: The last time that I stood here was seven years ago.

Q: Seven years ago. How little do you mortals understand time. Must you

be so linear, Jean-Luc?

PICARD: You accused me of being the representative of a barbarous

species.

Q: I believe my exact words were a dangerous, savage, child race.

PICARD: We demonstrated to you that mankind had become peaceful and

benevolent. You agreed and you let us go on our way.

Now why am I standing here again?

Q: Oh, you'd like me to connect the dots for you, lead you from A to B

to C so your puny mind can comprehend.

How boring. They'd be so much more entertained if you tried to figure

it out. I'll answer any ten questions that call for a yes or a no.

Well?

PICARD: Are you putting mankind on trial again?

Q: No.

PICARD: Is there any connection between the trial seven years ago and

whatever's going on now?

Q: I'd have to say yes.

PICARD: The spatial anomaly in the Neutral Zone, is it related to

what's happening?

Q: Most definitely yes.

PICARD: Is it part of a Romulan plot, a ploy to start a war?

Q: No and no. Five down.

PICARD: That's only four.

Q: Is it a Romulan plot? Is it a ploy to start a war? Those are

separate questions.

PICARD: Did you create the anomaly?

Q: No, no, no. You're going to be so surprised when you realise where

it came from, if you ever figure it out.

PICARD: Are you responsible for my shifting through time?

Q: I'll answer that question if you promise you won't tell anyone. (in

Picard's ear) Yes.

PICARD: Why?

Q: Sorry. That's not a yes or no question. You forfeit the rest of your

questions. I expected as much. You're such a limited creature. A

perfect example of why we made our decision. The trial never ended,

Captain. We never reached a verdict. But now we have. You're guilty.

PICARD: Guilty of what?

Q: Of being inferior. Seven years ago I said we'd be watching you, and

we have been, hoping that your ape-like race would demonstrate some

growth, give some indication that your minds have room for expansion.

But what have we seen instead? You worrying about Commander Riker's

career, listening to Counsellor Troi's pedantic psychobabble, indulging

Data in his witless exploration of humanity.

PICARD: We've journeyed to countless new worlds, we've contacted new

species, we have expanded our understanding of the universe.

Q: In your own paltry, limited way. You have no idea how far you still

have to go. But instead of using the last seven years to change and to

grow, you have squandered them.

PICARD: We are what we are, and we're doing the best we can. It is not

for you to set the standards by which we should be judged.

Q: Oh, but it is, and we have. Time may be eternal, Captain, but our

patience is not. It's time to put an end to your trek through the

stars, make room for other more worthy species.

PICARD: You're going to deny us travel through space?

Q: You obtuse piece of flotsam. You are to be denied existence.

Humanity's fate has been sealed. You will be destroyed.

PICARD: Q, I do not believe that even you are capable of such an act.

Q: I? There you go again, always blaming me for everything. Well this

time I'm not your enemy. I'm not the one that causes the annihilation

of mankind. You are.

PICARD: Me?

Q: That's right. You're doing it right now. You did it before and

you'll do it again.

PICARD: What sort of meaningless doubletalk is this?

Q: He doesn't understand. I have only myself to blame, I suppose. I

believed in you. I thought you had potential. But apparently I was

wrong. May whatever god you believe in have mercy on your soul. This

court stands adjourned.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Commander, assemble the senior staff and go

to Red alert. We have a bigger problem than I thought.

RIKER: Red alert!

[Observation lounge]

LAFORGE: I don't believe him. This has to be

another one of Q's games. He's probably listening to us right now,

getting a big laugh out of watching us jump through his hoops.

PICARD: Normally I would agree with you, but this time I feel that

somehow it is different. There was a deadly earnestness about him. I

think he's serious. Which means that in some fashion, I am going to be

the cause of the destruction of humanity.

CRUSHER: But didn't Q say you already had caused it?

TROI: And that you were causing it now?

DATA: Given the fact that there is an apparent discontinuity between

the three time periods the Captain has

visited, Q's statement may be accurate, if confusing.

PICARD: So what am I going to do? Lock myself in a room in all three

different time periods?

RIKER: Captain, maybe not acting is what causes the destruction of

mankind. What if you were needed on the Bridge at a key moment, and you

weren't there?

TROI: I don't think we can start second guessing ourselves. I think we

have to proceed normally and deal with each situation as it occurs.

PICARD: Agreed. I've been thinking about my conversation with Q. He

admitted that he was responsible for my shifting through time. Now it

occurred to me that he might be giving me a chance somehow to save

humanity.

RIKER: What makes you say that?

PICARD: Well, he's always had a certain fascination with humanity, with

myself in particular. I think he has more than a passing interest in

what happens to me.

DATA: That is true. Q's interest in you has always been very similar to

that of a master and his beloved pet. That was only an analogy,

Captain.

PICARD: If I weren't travelling through time I would never have

realized that the anomaly in the Neutral Zone appeared there in the

past as well. Assuming that's an important piece of a larger puzzle, my

ability to shift through time may be the key to understanding what's

going on.

CREWMAN [OC]: Captain Picard.

PICARD: Go ahead.

CREWMAN [OC]: We're approaching the Neutral Zone, Captain.

PICARD: We're on our way.

[Bridge]

PICARD: All stop. Initiate long range scans.

DATA: Captain, there are four warbirds holding position on the Romulan

side of the Neutral Zone.

WORF: The Federation Starships Concord and Bozeman are holding position

on our side.

RIKER: A face off. The question is, who's going to move first?

PICARD: We are. Mister Worf, hail the Romulan flagship.

WORF: The warbird Terix is responding.

PICARD: On screen.

WORF [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard.

[Future - USS Pasteur Bridge]

CRUSHER: Hello, Worf. It's been a long time.

WORF [on viewscreen]: It is good to see you again.

CRUSHER: Have you had a chance to read our request?

WORF [on viewscreen]: Yes. But you must realise I am no longer a member

of the High Council.

PICARD: But surely, Worf, you must still have some influence. We have

to get into the Neutral Zone. Can't you just get us permission to cross

the border?

WORF [on viewscreen]: I must refuse. It is for your own safety. The

Neutral Zone is extremely volatile. If Admiral Riker had given you a

starship with a cloak, you would have been safe. It is hard to believe

that even he would refuse to help you.

PICARD: I don't care what kind of ship we go in. We have to get to the

Devron System.

WORF [on viewscreen]: I am sorry. My first duty is to the Empire. I

must adhere to regulations.

PICARD: I know that I'm an old man and I'm out of touch, but the Worf

that I remember was more concerned with things like honour and loyalty

than rules and regulations. But that was a long time ago. Maybe you're

not the Worf once I knew.

WORF [on viewscreen]: Dor sHo GHA! You have always used your knowledge

of Klingon honour and tradition to get what you want from me.

PICARD: Because it always works, Worf. Your problem is that you really

do have a sense of honour and you really do care about trust and

loyalty. Don't blame me for knowing you so well.

WORF [on viewscreen]: Very well. You may cross the border. But only if

I come with you. I am familiar with the Neutral Zone.

PICARD: Terms accepted.

(transmission ends)

CRUSHER: Inform transporter room two to beam the Governor aboard. I

must make one thing very clear, Jean-Luc. If we run into any serious

opposition, I'm taking us back into Federation territory. We aren't

well armed and wouldn't last long in a fight.

CHILTON: Governor Worf is aboard, Captain.

CRUSHER: All right. Set course for the Devron system, warp thirteen.

(pause) Once more, for old time's sake?

(Picard sits in the Captain's chair and raises his hand)

PICARD: Engage.

[Past - Bridge]

O'BRIEN: Engage to where, sir?

PICARD: Set a course for the Devron system, and engage at warp nine.

TASHA: The Devron System is inside the Neutral Zone, sir.

PICARD: I'm aware of that, Lieutenant. Carry out my orders, Chief.

O'BRIEN: Aye, sir.

TROI: Captain, may I have a word with you in private?

PICARD: Yes of course, Counsellor. Contact Farpoint Station. I wish to

speak with Commander Riker.

TASHA: Aye, sir.

[Past - Ready room]

TROI: Captain, I just wanted to voice my concerns

about the way the crew is responding to your unexpected orders.

PICARD: They don't trust me. They think that I'm behaving erratically.

TROI: Some do. Others are confused. It takes some time for a new crew

to get to know their Captain, and for him to know them.

PICARD: I understand, but I also know what this crew is capable of,

even if they don't.

TROI: It would also help if they knew what was going on.

PICARD: I know it's difficult operating in the dark, but right now I

don't think I have any other choice.

TASHA [OC]: Yar to Captain Picard. I have Commander Riker for you, sir.

PICARD: Excuse me. Put him through here. Commander Riker. I wanted to

inform you that we'll be delayed in picking you up at Farpoint Station.

(we see Farpoint Riker on the monitor, but cut away when he's supposed

to be speaking)

RIKER [OC]: I see. May I ask how long?

PICARD: I can't say. I'll keep you updated. Will you inform Doctor

Crusher and Lieutenant La Forge of our delay?

RIKER [on monitor]: Understood.

RIKER [OC]: Riker out.

PICARD: Is there anything else, Counsellor?

TROI: Actually, sir, there is. I was debating whether to mention it,

and perhaps. It's about Commander Riker.

PICARD: What about him?

TROI: I think you should know he and I have had a prior relationship.

PICARD: I see. Do you think this will interfere with your duties?

TROI: Not at all. It happened several years ago and it's well behind

both of us now. I just thought you should know.

PICARD: I appreciate your telling me, but I'm quite sure that the two

of you will find some way to deal with the situation.

TROI: Thank you, sir.

(Troi leaves)

PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot.

COMPUTER: That beverage has not been programmed into the replication

system.

[Bridge]

TOMOLAK [on viewscreen]: So, Captain how long shall

we stare at each other across the Neutral Zone?

PICARD: There is an alternative, Tomolak. We each know why we're here.

We could each send one ship into the Neutral Zone to investigate the

anomaly in the Devron System.

TOMOLAK [on viewscreen]: Has Starfleet Command approved this

arrangement?

PICARD: No.

TOMOLAK [on viewscreen]: I like it already. Agreed. One ship from each

side. But I warn you, if another Federation starship tries to enter the

Zone.

PICARD: There is no need to make threats. We each know the

consequences.

TOMOLAK [on viewscreen]: Very well. I'll see you in the Devron system.

(transmission ends)

PICARD: Helm, set course for the Devron system, warp five.

GATES: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Engage.

(whoosh, and later)

DATA: Sensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directly ahead.

PICARD: All stop. On screen. Full scan, Mister Data.

DATA: Aye, sir.

PICARD: We have to get as much information as possible about that

anomaly.

[Past - Bridge]

DATA: We are approaching the Devron system,

Captain. Sensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directly

ahead.

PICARD: All stop. On screen. Then it is larger in the past.

TROI: Sir?

PICARD: Nothing. Full scan, Mister Data.

DATA: Aye, sir.

[Future - USS Pasteur Bridge]

PICARD: On screen! On screen! Let's see it!

(just a starfield)

DATA: As you can see, sir, there's nothing there.

(a little later)

DATA: Still nothing, Captain. I've conducted a full sensor sweep out to

one light year from the Pasteur. No temporal anomalies, no particle

fluctuations, nothing.

PICARD: I don't understand. It was here in the other two time periods.

Why isn't it here now?

WORF: Captain. I have been monitoring Klingon communication channels.

Several warships have been dispatched to this sector to search for a

renegade Federation vessel.

PICARD: You're not thinking about leaving?

CRUSHER: There's nothing here, Jean-Luc.

PICARD: There should be! There has to be! Data, is there some other way

to scan for a temporal disturbance? Something that isn't covered in a

normal sensor sweep.

DATA: There are several methods of detecting temporal disturbances, but

we're limited by the equipment on the Pasteur.

CRUSHER: We should head back to Federation territory.

DATA: However, it may be possible to modify the main deflector to emit

an inverse tachyon pulse, which could scan beyond the subspace barrier.

PICARD: That's it. Make it so.

CRUSHER: Wait a minute. Data, how long would this take?

DATA: To make the modifications and search the entire Devron system

will take approximately fourteen hours.

CRUSHER: All right. Data, begin to modify the tachyon pulse. Ensign

Chilton, lay in a course back to the Federation. We'll stay here for

six more hours, and if we haven't found anything we're heading back,

maximum warp.

CHILTON: Aye, sir.

PICARD: But six more hours may not be enough. We have to stay here

until we find it, no matter how long it takes.

CRUSHER: Carry out my orders. May I see you a moment?

[Future - USS Pasteur Ready room]

PICARD: Beverly, I cannot believe that you are not

willing to stay here until we

CRUSHER: Don't you ever question my orders on the Bridge of my ship

again!

PICARD: Damn it, I was just trying to. Look, there are larger concerns

here. What you don't understand is that

CRUSHER: I understand that you would never have tolerated that kind of

behaviour back on the Enterprise and I won't here. I don't care if

you're my ex-Captain or my ex-husband.

PICARD: You're right. I was out of line. It won't happen again. But

what you have to understand is what is at stake here. Q has said that

all of humanity will be destroyed.

CRUSHER: I know. That's why I've allowed us to stay here longer and

keep looking. But I also want you to allow for the possibility that

none of what you're saying is real.

PICARD: What?

CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, I care for you too much not to tell you the truth.

You have advanced Irumodic Syndrome. It's

possible that all of this is in your mind. I'll stay here six hours

longer and then we're heading home. I want you to remember, if it were

anyone but you, we wouldn't even be here.

(Crusher leaves, Q appears as a ancient man with an ear trumpet)

Q: Eh? What was that she said, sonny? I couldn't quite hear her.

PICARD: Q? What is going on here? Where is the anomaly?

Q: Where's your mommy? Well, I don't know.

PICARD: Answer me.

Q: There is an answer, Jean-Luc, but I can't hand it to you. Although

you do have help.

PICARD: What help?

Q: You're not alone, you know. What you were and what you are to become

will always with you.

PICARD: My time shifting. The answer does lie there, doesn't it. Now,

tell me one thing. This anomaly we're looking for, will that destroy

humanity?

Q: You're forgetting, Jean-Luc. You destroy humanity.

PICARD: By doing what? When? How can

[Bridge]

PICARD: Report, Mister Data.

DATA: The anomaly is two hundred million kilometres in diameter. It is

a highly focused temporal energy source which is emitting approximately

the same energy output as ten G type stars.

PICARD: What is the source of this energy?

DATA: I am uncertain, sir. Sensors are unable to penetrate the anomaly.

PICARD: What if we modified the main deflector to emit an inverse

tachyon pulse. That might be able to scan beyond the subspace barrier.

That might give us some idea of what the interior of this thing looks

like.

DATA: That is a most intriguing idea, sir. I do not believe a tachyon

beam was ever used in such a way. I had no idea you were so versed in

the intricacies of temporal theory, sir.

PICARD: I have some friends who are quite well versed in it. Make it

so.

DATA: I believe we can make the necessary modifications in main

Engineering, sir.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We can get more power if we reroute the

primary EPS taps to the deflector array.

DATA: Agreed. Initiating tachyon pulse.

LAFORGE: Okay. the pulse is holding steady. We're starting to receive

data from the scan.

DATA: It will take the computer some time to give us a complete picture

of the anomaly's interior. I suggest we

(La Forge holds his head in pain)

DATA: Geordi? What is wrong?

LAFORGE: I don't know. It's like somebody's sticking an ice pick in my

temples. My visor's picking up all kinds of electromagnetic

fluctuations.

DATA: Data to Sickbay. Medical emergency in main Engineering.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: This is amazing. The DNA in his optic

nerves is regenerating. Geordi, it's as if you're growing new eyes.

PICARD: How is this possible?

CRUSHER: It shouldn't be possible at all. There's no medical

explanation for spontaneous regeneration of an organ.

OGAWA: Doctor we've just gotten reports from two crewmembers who say

they have old scars which are healing themselves.

DATA: Captain, I believe I have a partial explanation. I have completed

my analysis of the anomaly. It appears to be a multi-phasic temporal

convergence in the space-time continuum.

CRUSHER: In English, Data.

DATA: It is, in essence, an eruption of anti-time.

PICARD: Anti-time?

DATA: A relatively new concept in temporal mechanics. The relationship

between anti-time and normal time is analogous to the relationship

between antimatter and normal matter.

PICARD: So if time and anti-time were to collide

DATA: They would annihilate one other, causing a rupture in space. I

believe this is what happened in the Devron system. The rupture may be

sending out waves of temporal energy which are disrupting the normal

flow of time.

PICARD: Data, what could have caused this collision of time and

anti-time?

[Past - Bridge]

DATA: Anti-time, sir?

PICARD: I believe that if you modify the deflectors to send out an

inverse tachyon pulse, then you'll find that the anomaly is a rupture

between time and anti-time.

DATA: That is a fascinating hypothesis. How did you formulate

PICARD: I don't have time to discuss it now, Mister Data. Do the

modifications and send out the pulse. Then try working on a theory as

to what caused this rupture. Mister O'Brien, how large is this anomaly?

O'BRIEN: Approximately four hundred million kilometres in diameter,

sir.

PICARD: I don't understand why it's bigger in the past.

PICARD: Lieutenant, you have the Bridge. I'll be in my Ready room.

TASHA: Aye, sir.

[Future - USS Pasteur Bridge]

PICARD: What's going on?

CRUSHER: We're under attack.

CHILTON: Shield strength down to fifty two percent. Minor damage to the

port nacelle.

WORF: Two Klingon attack cruisers decloaking to port and starboard.

CRUSHER: Warp speed. Get us out of here.

CHILTON: Warp power's offline, sir.

CRUSHER: Heading one four eight, mark two one five. Full impulse.

CHILTON: Impulse power's fluctuating. Shields down to thirty percent.

PICARD: Weapons status?

WORF: These weapons are no match for their shields.

CRUSHER: Geordi, we need more warp power, now.

LAFORGE: I'm trying, Captain. They're too much for us. I can't keep the

phase inducers online.

CHILTON: Shields down to nine percent. One more hit and they'll

collapse.

CRUSHER: Open a channel.

CHILTON: Open.

CRUSHER: This is Captain Beverly Picard. We are a medical ship on a

mission of mercy. Please break off all (Bang) Worf, signal our

surrender.

WORF: Tos Vah'cha Worf, do'lo jegh!

(but they fire again, and Chilton is killed)

WORF: Our shields have collapsed. We are defenceless.

DATA: Captain, another ship decloaking bearing two one five mark three

one oh. It's the Enterprise.

(a three-nacelled Enterprise)

DATA: They're hailing us.

CRUSHER: On screen.

RIKER: I had a feeling you weren't going to listen to me. Stand by.

I'll see if I can get the Klingons' attention.

(Enterprise phasers slice through the Klingon shields and ships.

KaBOOM!)

WORF: The Enterprise is drawing their fire.

CRUSHER: Damage report.

LAFORGE: The warp core has been badly damaged. There's a breach in

progress.

PICARD: We have to stop it!

DATA: The Klingon ship is disengaging. Admiral Riker is hailing us.

RIKER: Our sensors indicate your ship has a warp core breach in

progress. Prepare for emergency beam out.

[Future Bridge]

(everyone is beamed onto the bridge)

GAINES: All the Pasteur's crew are safely on board, Admiral.

RIKER: Raise the shields. Where are the Klingons?

GAINES: They're still moving off, sir. Half a light year away.

RIKER: They'll be back. As I said, I figured you wouldn't take no for

answer. (to Worf) But I thought you had more sense than to send a

defenceless ship across the border into hostile territory with no

escort.

WORF: If you had not turned down the Captain when he came to you for

help, none of this would have happened. Unlike you, I still have a

sense of honour and loyalty.

PICARD: We don't have time for this. The Pasteur's core is going to

breach.

RIKER: Take us out of here. Full impulse.

(KaBOOM)

RIKER: All right, let's get out of here.

PICARD: No, Will, we can't! We have to save humanity.

RIKER: Engage cloak.

GAINES: Admiral, we took a direct hit to the starboard plasma coil. Our

cloak isn't functioning. Engineering reports it'll be seven hours

before we can cloak again.

RIKER: All right, we'll do it the old-fashioned way. Set a course for

the Federation, warp thirteen.

PICARD: Will, don't leave! We have to stay here and find what is

causing the temporal anomaly.

RIKER: We can't stay, Captain.

PICARD: We have to! Everything depends on it! We can't leave now!

Please, listen to me!

(Beverly knocks him out with a hypo)

[Corridor]

(as Picard passes out in the future, he bumps into

a crewman in the present)

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Your visual acuity's improving by the

hour, Geordi.

(she goes over to another bed)

CRUSHER: I'm sorry, Alyssa. May I take another look? You'll have a

little tenderness for a few days. That's to be expected.

(Picard enters)

CRUSHER: Jean-Luc. I'll be right back, Alyssa.

(she moves away from Alyssa and her husband)

CRUSHER: Alyssa lost the baby. I think it's the same phenomenon that

affected Geordi. Somehow, the temporal energy from the anomaly caused

the foetal tissue to revert to an earlier stage of development. It's as

if the unborn child began to grow younger, until finally the DNA itself

began to break down.

PICARD: How is she?

CRUSHER: Physically, she's fine for now. But if this temporal reversion

continues, I don't think any of us are going to be fine for much

longer.

PICARD: So this is affecting the entire crew.

CRUSHER: Our cellular structures appear to be coalescing, reverting to

earlier forms. In some cases, this has caused old injuries to be

healed, but the effect is only temporary. Eventually, may kill all of

us.

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: We have to find out how widespread this

effect is. Contact Starbase Twenty three, that's the nearest outpost.

Have them check their personnel to see if there are any signs of

temporal reversion.

TROI: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Mister Data, how close are you to completing the tachyon scan?

DATA: Approximately one hour forty five minutes, sir.

PICARD: Good. When it's done I want you to find some way of collapsing

this anomaly without making things worse. Give me a risk analysis of

whatever solution you come up with.

DATA: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Dismissed.

(Data, Troi and Riker leave)

Q: It's a pretty big decision, Jean-Luc. Tinkering with an anomaly you

know nothing about, trying to collapse it. Isn't that risky?

PICARD: Why? Will that cause the destruction of mankind?

Q: Maybe. On the other hand, maybe leaving it alone would be the wrong

thing to do. It's a pretty big decision, all right. Would it help to

have a different perspective?

[Primordial Earth]

Q: Welcome home.

PICARD: Home?

Q: Don't you recognise your old stomping grounds? This is Earth,

France, about, oh, three and a half billion years ago, give or take an

eon or two. Smells awful, doesn't it? All that sulphur and volcanic

ash. I really must speak to the maid.

PICARD: Q, is there any point to all this?

Q: Look.

(a purple sky is dominated by a swirling white)

PICARD: So the anomaly is here too, at Earth.

Q: At this point in history the anomaly fills your entire quadrant of

the galaxy.

PICARD: The further back in time, the larger the anomaly.

Q: Come here. There's something I want to show you. You see this?

(a sludge filled pond)

Q: This is you. I'm serious. Right here, life is about to form on this

planet for the very first time. A group of amino acids are about to

combine and form the first protein, the building blocks of what you

call life. Strange, isn't it?

Everything you know, your entire civilisation, it all begins right here

in this little pond of goo. Appropriate, somehow, isn't it? Too bad you

didn't bring your microscope. It's really quite fascinating. Oh, look,

there they go. The amino acids are moving closer and closer, and

closer. Oh! Nothing happened. See what you've done?

PICARD: Are you saying that I caused the anomaly, and that the anomaly

somehow disrupted the beginnings of life on Earth?

Q: Congratulations.

[Past - Engineering]

PICARD: Let's concentrate on how this anomaly was

initially formed. Speculation?

DATA: Our tachyon pulse has been unable to completely penetrate the

anomaly. If we had information on the centre of the phenomenon, we

might have a basis for speculation.

PICARD: Is there any way that we can scan the interior?

O'BRIEN: I've tried everything I know. There's just too much

interference. There's nothing on board that'll do the job.

PICARD: Do you know what could?

DATA: In theory, a tomographic imaging scanner capable of multiphasic

resolution would be able to penetrate this much interference. The

Daystrom Institute has been working on such a device, but it is still

only theoretical.

[Bridge]

(at the science station)

PICARD: Data do we have a tomographic imaging scanner on board?

DATA: Yes, sir.

PICARD: Can you use it to scan the interior of the anomaly?

DATA: Possibly. (taps the console) There is a great deal of

interference, but I am getting some readings. This is very unusual.

PICARD: What is it?

DATA: It appears that our tachyon pulse is converging with two other

tachyon pulses at the centre of the anomaly. The other two pulses have

the exact same amplitude modulation as our own pulse. It is as if all

three originated from the Enterprise.

PICARD: Three pulses, from three time periods, converging at one point

in space.

DATA: Captain, what are you suggesting?

[Future - Enterprise guest quarters]

(Picard wakes up)

PICARD: Computer, where is Admiral Riker?

COMPUTER: Admiral Riker is in Ten Forward.

[Future - Ten Forward]

LAFORGE: The ship has held up pretty well over the

years.

RIKER: They tried to decommission her about five years ago. One of the

advantages of being an Admiral is you get to choose your own ship.

CRUSHER: Will, how long is this thing between you and Worf going to go

on?

RIKER: It's been going on for over twenty years. Doesn't look like it's

going to end any time soon.

DATA: I suspect the last thing Counsellor Troi would have wanted is for

the two of you to be alienated.

CRUSHER: I agree. I think it's time to put it behind you.

RIKER: I tried at Deanna's funeral. He wouldn't even talk to me.

LAFORGE: Might have been tough for him then. He took her death pretty

hard.

RIKER: Oh, yeah? Well he wasn't the only one.

CRUSHER: I know, but I think in his mind you were the reason that he

and Deanna never got together.

RIKER: I never did anything to stand in his way.

CRUSHER: Didn't you, Will?

RIKER: Did I? I didn't want to admit that it was over. I always thought

that we'd get together again. And then she was gone. You think you have

all the time in the world, until. Yeah.

[Future - Corridor]

PICARD: Ensign. How do I get to Ten Forward?

ENSIGN: It's four decks down, sir. Section zero zero five.

PICARD: Thank you.

[Future - Ten Forward]

CRUSHER: Oh, my god.

PICARD: Will! Will, I know why it's happening. I know what's causing

the anomaly. We have to go back.

RIKER: The only place we're going back to, sir, is bed.

PICARD: Damn it Will, I know why it's happening. We caused the anomaly

with the tachyon pulse. It happened three times, Will. We did it in

three different time periods!

CRUSHER: I think you'd better come with me.

PICARD: Will you leave me alone? Damn it, I'm not stupid. Will, the

tachyon pulses, they were used in the same spot in three different time

periods. Don't you see? When the tachyon pulse used. I mean, I mean

when the Pasteur used the tachyon pulse, then, then, we I mean

everything started, Will. We set everything in motion. It's like the

chicken and the egg, Will, the chicken and the egg! We think it started

in the past but it didn't. It started right here, in the future. That's

why it's getting larger in the past.

DATA: I think I know what the Captain's talking about. If I'm not

mistaken, he's describing a paradox.

PICARD: Yes! Right. That's it.

DATA: Intriguing. It is possible we could've caused the very anomaly

we've been looking for. Let us assume for a moment that the Captain has

been travelling through time. Let us also assume he has initiated an

tachyon pulse at the same coordinates in space in all three time

periods. In that case, it is possible that the convergence of three

tachyon pulses could've ruptured the subspace barrier and created an

anti-time reaction.

LAFORGE: I see where you're going, Data. And because anti-time operates

opposite the way normal time does, the effects would travel backwards

through the space-time continuum.

PICARD: Yes. That's why it gets larger in the past. It grows as it

travels backwards in time.

RIKER: All right. Just for the moment lets say that you're right. What

do we do?

PICARD: Go back, Will. We go back to the Devron System.

CRUSHER: He may be right.

DATA: If we go back to the Devron system now, we might be able to see

the initial formation of the anomaly.

RIKER: Riker to Bridge. Set course for the Devron system, maximum warp.

GAINES [OC]: Aye, sir.

RIKER: Worf, we could use a hand.

[Future - Bridge]

GAINES: Entering the Devron system, sir.

RIKER: Full stop.

DATA: Sensors are picking up a small temporal anomaly off the port bow.

RIKER: On screen.

PICARD: I was right.

LAFORGE: It's an anti-time eruption. It seems to have been formed

within the last six hours.

PICARD: We must stop it here so it can't travel back through time.

RIKER: Mister Data, we need a solution and we need it now.

DATA: The anomaly is being sustained by the continuing tachyon pulses

in the other two time periods. I suggest shutting them down.

PICARD: The next time I'm there, it's the first thing I'll do.

RIKER: Isn't there something more we can do here to seal the rupture

somehow?

DATA: I will investigate the options.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Data, disengage the tachyon pulse.

DATA: Sir?

PICARD: Do it. The convergence of the tachyon pulses from the three

time periods is what is causing the anomaly.

DATA: Aye, sir.

PICARD: Is there any change in the anomaly?

[Past - Bridge]

DATA: No, sir.

PICARD: Disengage the tachyon pulse.

O'BRIEN: but e haven't finished the scan, sir.

PICARD: I know that. But it is imperative that you disengage the

tachyon pulse immediately.

DATA: Aye, sir. Disengaging.

PICARD: Why isn't the anomaly being affected?

O'BRIEN: Why would it be, sir?

[Future - Bridge]

PICARD: I've shut off the tachyon pulses in the

other time periods but it hasn't changed the

anomaly.

DATA: It remains unaffected here as well, sir.

CRUSHER: What do we do?

LAFORGE: The only way to stop this thing's to repair the rupture at the

focal point where time and anti-time are converging.

RIKER: How do we do that?

DATA: It would require taking the ship into the anomaly itself. Once

inside, we may be able to use the engines to create a static warp

shell.

LAFORGE: Yeah, Data, that's right. And the shell would act as an

artificial subspace barrier separating time and anti-time.

DATA: Collapsing the anomaly and restoring the normal flow of time. But

this would have to be done in the other two time periods as well.

PICARD: That could be a problem. The anomaly's so much larger in the

other two time periods

[Past - Bridge]

PICARD: It may be dangerous to take the ship in.

O'BRIEN: Take the ship in where, sir?

PICARD: Into the anomaly, Chief. Lay in a course for the exact centre

and transfer all available power to the shields.

TASHA: Sir? Can you give us some explanation?

PICARD: No, Lieutenant, I cannot.

TASHA: Captain, so far we've obeyed every order, no matter how far

fetched it might have seemed. But if we're to risk the safety of the

ship and crew I think we have to ask you for an explanation.

PICARD: I understand your concerns, Lieutenant, and I know if I were in

your position I would be doing the same thing. Looking for answers. But

you're not going to find any because I don't have any to give you. I

know it is difficult for you to understand, but we have to take the

ship into the very centre of the phenomenon and create a static warp

shell. Now, this will put the ship at risk. Quite frankly, we may not

survive. But I want you to believe that I am doing this for a greater

purpose, and that what is at stake here is more than any of you can

possibly imagine. I know you have your doubts about me, about each

other, about the ship. All I can say is that although we have only been

together for a short time, I know that you are the finest crew in the

fleet and I would trust each of you with my life. So, I am asking you

for a leap of faith, and to trust me.

TASHA: Shields up, maximum strength.

WORF: Boosting field integrity to the warp nacelles. We may encounter

shearing forces once we enter the anomaly.

DATA: I am preparing to initiate a static warp shell.

O'BRIEN: Course laid in, sir.

TROI: All decks report ready, sir.

PICARD: Take us in, Chief.

[Bridge]

DATA: Captain, I have an idea. If we take the ship

to the centre of the anomaly and create a static warp shell

PICARD: A static warp shell. It could repair the barrier and collapse

the anomaly.

DATA: Yes, sir.

PICARD: Mister Data, you're a clever man in any time period. Helm, lay

in a course for the centre of the anomaly and prepare to initiate a

static warp shell.

HELM: Aye, sir.

[Future - Bridge]

PICARD: The other two Enterprises, they're on their

way.

RIKER: Very well. Ensign, take us in.

[Past - Bridge]

O'BRIEN: We're entering the anomaly, sir.

PICARD: All hands, brace for impact!

TASHA: The temporal energy's interfering with main power. Switching to

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Auxiliary power. I'm having trouble

keeping the impulse engines online. I've got power fluctuations all

across the board.

PICARD: Maintain course and speed. Mister Data, how long until we reach

the centre?

DATA: At least thirty seconds, sir.

[Future - Bridge]

GAINES: We've entered the anomaly.

[Past - Bridge]

DATA: We have reached the centre, sir.

PICARD: Initiate warp shell!

[Bridge]

DATA: Initiating static warp shell now.

[Future - Bridge]

RIKER: Is it having any effect?

[Past - Bridge]

DATA: Something is happening. A new subspace

barrier appears to be forming,

TASHA: Captain, the sensors are picking up two other ships.

(and we see the other Enterprises on the three viewscreens)

[Past - Bridge]

DATA: Captain, it appears to be working. The

anomaly is beginning to collapse. I think that

TASHA: Temporal energy is rupturing our warp containment system!

WORF: We must eject the core!

PICARD: No, we have to maintain the static warp shell as long as

possible!

TASHA: We're losing containment, Captain! I can't stop it, it's going

to

(KaBOOM!)

[Bridge]

PICARD: Transfer emergency power to the antimatter

containment system!

LAFORGE: I'm trying, but there's a lot of interference.

DATA: The warp shell is definitely having an effect, sir. The anomaly

is collapsing.

LAFORGE: I can't hold it. The containment system is going.

PICARD: Maintain position! Mister La

(KaBOOM!)

[Future - Bridge]

DATA: Both of the other ships have been destroyed.

Q: Two down, one to go.

PICARD: Data, report!

DATA: The anomaly is nearly collapsed.

LAFORGE: We're losing containment.

Q: Goodbye, Jean-Luc. I'm going to miss you. You had such potential.

But then again, all good things must come to an end.

LAFORGE: Containment field is at critical. I'm losing it!

(the anomaly sucks into the Enterprise and KaBOOM!)

[Courtroom]

(Picard is sitting with his head in his hands)

Q: The Continuum didn't think you had it in you, Jean-Luc, but I knew

you did.

PICARD: Are you saying that it worked? We collapsed the anomaly?

Q: Is that all this meant to you? Just another spatial anomaly? Just

another day at the office?

PICARD: Did it work?

Q: Well, you're here, aren't you? You're talking to me, aren't you?

PICARD: What about my crew?

Q: The anomaly. My crew. My ship. I suppose you're worried about your

fish, too. Well, if it puts your mind at ease, you've saved humanity

once again.

PICARD: Thank you.

Q: For what?

PICARD: You had a hand in helping me get out of this.

Q: I was the one that got you into it. A directive from the Continuum.

The part about the helping hand, thought, was my idea.

PICARD: I sincerely hope that this is the last time that I find myself

here.

Q: You just don't get it, do you, Jean-Luc? The trial never ends. We

wanted to see if you had the ability to expand your mind and your

horizons. And for one brief moment, you did.

PICARD: When I realised the paradox.

Q: Exactly. For that one fraction of a second, you were open to options

you had never considered. That is the exploration that awaits you. Not

mapping stars and studying nebulae, but charting the unknowable

possibilities of existence.

PICARD: Q, what is it that you're trying to tell me?

(Q nearly whispers in Picard's ear)

Q: You'll find out. In any case, I'll be watching. And if you're very

lucky, I'll drop by to say hello from time to time. See you out there.

[Corridor]

(Troi and Worf are about to kiss when Picard comes

out of the turbolift in his dressing gown)

TROI: Captain, are you all right?

PICARD: Mister Worf, what's the date?

WORF: Stardate 47988.

TROI: Is something wrong, sir?

PICARD: No. No. No. I think I'll get back to bed. I could use some

sleep.

Captain's log, supplemental. Starfleet Command

reports no unusual activity along the Neutral Zone, and there is no

sign of a temporal anomaly. It would appear that I am the only member

of the crew to retain any knowledge of the events I experienced.

[Riker's quarters]

(the senior staff poker game has been going for a

while)

CRUSHER: Take it.

RIKER: Any time, Doctor.

LAFORGE: Four hands in a row. How does he do it?

RIKER: I cheat. I'm kidding.

CRUSHER: You know, I was thinking about what the Captain told us about

the future. About how we all changed and drifted apart. Why would he

want to tell us what's to come?

LAFORGE: Sure goes against everything we've heard about not polluting

the time line, doesn't it.

DATA: I believe, however, this situation is unique. Since the anomaly

did not occur, there have already been changes in the way this time

line is unfolding. The future we experience will undoubtedly be

different from the one the Captain encountered.

RIKER: Maybe that's why he told us. Knowing what happens in that future

allows us to change things now, so that some things never happen.

(Worf and Riker look at each other)

WORF: Agreed.

(doorbell)

RIKER: Come in.

TROI: Am I too late?

RIKER: Of course not. Pull up a chair.

TROI: What's the game?

DATA: Five card draw, deuces wild.

(doorbell)

RIKER: Come.

(Picard enters, and everyone stares)

RIKER: Is there a problem, sir?

PICARD: No. I, er, I just thought that I might, erm, I might join you

this evening. If there's room.

RIKER: Of course. Have a seat.

DATA: Would you care to deal, sir?

PICARD: Oh, er, thank you, Mister Data. Actually, I used to be quite a

card player in my youth, you know. I should have done this a long time

ago.

TROI: You were always welcome.

PICARD: So. Five card stud, nothing wild, and the sky's the limit.
