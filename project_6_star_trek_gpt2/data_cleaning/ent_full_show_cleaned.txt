  [Archer
home - 2121]
 (A young boy is painting a model spaceship, under
the watchful eye of his father)
JONATHAN: Where no man has gone before.
FATHER: Doctor Cochrane would be proud of you.
JONATHAN: I know the whole speech by heart. When's it going to be ready
to fly?
FATHER: Let the paint dry first.
JONATHAN: No, I mean the ship.
FATHER: Not for a while. It hasn't even been built yet. You know that.
JONATHAN: How big will it be?
FATHER: Pretty big.
JONATHAN: Bigger than Ambassador Pointy's ship?
FATHER: His name is Soval, and he's been very helpful. And I've told
you not to call him that, Jonathan.
JONATHAN: Well, Billy Cook said we'd be flying at warp five by now if
the Vulcans hadn't kept things from us.
FATHER: Well they have their reasons. God knows what they are.
 [Broken Bow, Oklahoma - 30 Years Later]
 (A field has a ship crash-landed in it. A Klingon
is running from two alien pursuers. The farmer goes to get his rifle
while the Klingon hides in the grain silo. One aliens slides underneath
the door to the silo and unlocks it for the other. The Klingon jumps
from the upper door and runs before turning to blow up the silo. The
farmer arrives on the scene.)
MOORE: Drop your weapon! I mean it!
KLAANG: (unintelligible)
MOORE: I don't understand a word you're saying, but I guarantee you I
know how to use this.
KLAANG: (unintelligible) (He steps forward, so the farmer shoots him.)
 [Space pod]
 (Approaching a spaceship in spacedock.)
TUCKER: The ventral plating team says they'll be done in about three
days.
ARCHER: Be sure they match the colour to the nacelle housings.
TUCKER: You planning to sit on the hull and pose for some postcards?
ARCHER: Maybe. God, she's beautiful.
TUCKER: And fast. Warp four point five next Thursday.
ARCHER: Neptune and back in six minutes. Let's take a look at the
lateral sensor array.
TUCKER: Give me a second.
ARCHER: Slow down. There, those are the ports that buckled during the
last test. They need to be reinforced. (Tucker makes a note and the pod
bounces against the ship's hull) Great, you scratched the paint.
TUCKER: Sorry. Orbital six.
CREWMAN [OC]: Captain Archer, sir.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
CREWMAN [OC]: Admiral Forrest needs you at Starfleet Medical right
away.
 [Starfleet Medical - observation room]
 WILLIAMS: Who was chasing him? (The Vulcan Ambassador replies.)
SOVAL: We don't know. They were incinerated in the methane explosion,
and the farmer's description was vague at best.
LEONARD: How did they get here? What kind of ship?
TOS: (another Vulcan) They were using some kind of stealth technology. We're still
analyzing our sensor logs.
WILLIAMS: I'd like to see those logs.
SOVAL: The Klingons made it very clear they want us to expedite this.
LEONARD: It happened on our soil.
TOS: That's irrelevant.
FORREST: Ambassador, with all due respect, we have a right to know
what's going on here.
SOVAL: You will be apprised of all pertinent information.
WILLIAMS: And just who gets to decide what's pertinent information?
ARCHER: Admiral.
FORREST: Jon. I think you know everyone.
ARCHER: Not everyone.
LEONARD: It's a Klingot.
TOS: A Klingon.
ARCHER: Where'd he come from? (They're viewing through window.)
WILLIAMS: Oklahoma.
FORREST: A corn farmer named Moore shot him with a plasma rifle. Says
it was self-defense.
TOS: Fortunately, Soval and I have maintained close contact with Kronos
since the incident occurred.
ARCHER: Kronos?
LEONARD: It's the Klingon's homeworld.
FORREST: This gentleman is some sort of a courier. Evidently he was
carrying crucial information back to his people.
SOVAL: When he was nearly killed by your "farmer."
FORREST: Ambassador Soval thinks it would be best if we push off your
launch until we've cleared this up.
ARCHER: Well, isn't that a surprise. You'd think they'd have come up
with something a little more imaginative this time.
SOVAL: Sarcasm aside, Captain, the last thing your people need is to
make an enemy of the Klingon Empire.
TOS: If we hadn't convinced them to let us take Klaang's corpse back to
Kronos, Earth would most likely be facing a squadron of Warbirds by the
end of the week.
ARCHER: Corpse? Is he dead?
 [Intensive Care Unit]
 ARCHER: Excuse me, is that man dead? (He speaks to a humanoid with a high forehead and ridges running up from the outside of his eyesockets.)
PHLOX: His autonomic system was disrupted by the blast but his
redundant neural functions are
ARCHER: Is he going to die?
PHLOX: Not necessarily.
 [Starfleet Medical - observation room]
 ARCHER: Let me get this straight. You're going to
disconnect this man from life support even though he could live. Now
where's the logic in that?
SOVAL: Klaang's culture finds honour in death. If they saw him like
this he'd be disgraced.
TOS: They're a warrior race. They dream of dying in battle. If you
understood the complexities of interstellar diplomacy
ARCHER: So that's your diplomatic solution, to do what they tell you.
Pull the plug?
TOS: Your metaphor is crude, but accurate.
ARCHER: We may be crude, but we're not murderers. You're not going to
let them do this, are you?
SOVAL: The Klingons have demanded that we return Klaang immediately.
ARCHER: Admiral.
FORREST: We may need to defer to their judgement.
ARCHER: We've been deferring to their judgement for a hundred years!
FORREST: Jon.
ARCHER: How much longer?
T'POL: Until you've proven you're ready,
ARCHER: Ready to what?
T'POL: To look beyond your provincial attitudes and volatile nature.
ARCHER: Volatile? You have no idea how much I'm restraining myself from
knocking you on your ass. These Klingons, they're anxious to get their
man back. Fine. I can have my ship ready to go in three days. We'll
take him back home, alive.
SOVAL: This is no time to be imposing your ethical beliefs.
FORREST: Dan?
LEONARD: What about your crew? Your Comm. Officer's in Brazil. You
haven't selected a Medical Officer yet.
ARCHER: Three days, that's all I need.
SOVAL: (protesting) Admiral.
FORREST: We've been waiting for nearly a century, Ambassador. This
seems as good a time as any to get started.
SOVAL: Listen to me. You're making a mistake!
ARCHER: When your logic doesn't work, you raise your voice? You've been
on Earth too long. (The Vulcans leave)
FORREST: I had a feeling their approach wouldn't sit too well with you.
Don't screw this up.
(Archer knocks on ICU window and beckons Phlox over)
 [USS Enterprise - Transporter alcove]
(A dark-skinned human and one with an English accent.)TRAVIS: I heard this platform's been approved for
bio-transport.
REED: I presume you mean fruits and vegetables.
TRAVIS: I mean Armoury Officers and Helmsmen.
REED: I don't think I'm quite ready to have my molecules compressed
into a data stream.
TRAVIS: They claim it's safe.
REED: Do they indeed. Well, I certainly hope the Captain doesn't plan
on making us use it.
TRAVIS: Don't worry, from what I'm told, he wouldn't even put his dog
through this thing.
REED: (opening newly arrived box) This is ridiculous. I asked for
plasma coils and they sent me a case of valve sealant. There's no
chance I can have these weapons online in three days.
TRAVIS: We're just taking a sick man back to his homeworld. Why do we
need weapons?
REED: Didn't you read the profile report on these Klingons? Apparently,
they sharpen their teeth before they go into battle.
 [Corridor]
 REED: No doubt Mister Tucker will reassure me that
my equipment will be here tomorrow. Keep your shirt on, Lieutenant.
TRAVIS: Is it me, or does the artificial gravity seem a bit heavy?
REED: Feels all right. Earth sea level.
TRAVIS: My father always kept it at point eight G. He thought it put a
little spring in his step.
REED: After being raised on cargo ships, it must've felt like you had
lead in your boots when you got to Earth.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Beautiful. Lock it off right there. (The slightly southern USA accented man wipes
a fingerprint off the warp console.)
REED: I believe you missed a spot. Commander Tucker, Ensign Travis
Mayweather. He just arrived.
TUCKER: Our space boomer.
TRAVIS: How fast have you gotten her?
TUCKER: Warp four. We'll be going to four five as soon as we clear
Jupiter. Think you can handle it?
TRAVIS: Four point five.
REED: Pardon me, but if I don't realign the deflector, the first grain
of space dust we come across will blow a hole through this ship the
size of your fist.
TUCKER: Keep your shirt on, Lieutenant. Your equipment'll be here in
the morning.
[Amazon University - outdoor classroom]
(An Asian woman is giving a language class. The ! indicates a click sound against the palate.)HOSHI: Ghlungit !tak nekleet.
STUDENTS: Ghlungit !tak nekleet.
HOSHI: Very good. Ghlungit !tak nekleet.
STUDENTS: Ghlungit !tak nekleet.
HOSHI: Carlos. Ltrunghi !krgltt!
CARLOS: Ltrunghi !krgltt!
HOSHI: !krgltt!
CARLOS: !krgltt!
HOSHI: Tighten the back of your tongue. !krgltt!
CARLOS: !krgltt! !krgltt!
HOSHI: Keep trying. You've almost got it. (sees Archer) I'll be right
back.
(They walk along a leafy path)
HOSHI: There's two more weeks before exams. It's impossible for me to
leave now.
ARCHER: You've got to have someone who can cover for you.
HOSHI: If there was anyone else who could do what I do, you wouldn't be
so eager to have me on your space ship.
ARCHER: Hoshi
HOSHI: I'm sorry, Captain. I owe it to these kids.
ARCHER: I could order you.
HOSHI: I'm on leave from Starfleet, remember? You would have to
forcibly recall me, which would require a reprimand which would
disqualify me from serving on an active vessel.
ARCHER: I need someone with your ear.
HOSHI: And you'll have her in three weeks. (Archer plays a recording)
What's that?
ARCHER: Klingon. Ambassador Soval gave us a sampling of their
linguistic database.
HOSHI: I thought you said the Vulcans were opposed to this.
ARCHER: They are. but we agreed to make a few compromises.
HOSHI: What do you know about these Klingons?
ARCHER: Not much. An empire of warriors with eighty poly-guttural
dialects constructed on an adaptive syntax.
HOSHI: Turn it up.
ARCHER: Think about it. You'd be the first human to talk to these
people. Do you really want someone else to do it?
[Corridor]

TUCKER: Since when do we have Vulcan Science
Officers?
ARCHER: Since we needed their star charts to get to Kronos.
TUCKER: So we get a few maps and they get to put a spy on our ship?
[Ready room]
ARCHER: Admiral Forrest says we should think of her
more as a chaperone.
TUCKER: I thought the whole point of this was to get away from the
Vulcans.
ARCHER: Four days there, four days back, then she's gone. In the
meantime, we're to extend her every courtesy.
TUCKER: I don't know. I'd be more comfortable with Porthos on the
Bridge.
ARCHER: Here we go. Come in.
T'POL: This confirms that I was formally transferred to your command at
oh eight hundred hours. Reporting for duty. (The Vulcan woman sniffs.)
ARCHER: Is there a problem?
T'POL: No, sir.
ARCHER: Oh, I forgot. Vulcan females have a heightened sense of smell.
I hope Porthos isn't too offensive to you.
T'POL: I've been trained to tolerate offensive situations.
TUCKER: I took a shower this morning. How about you, Captain?
ARCHER: I'm sorry. This is Commander Charles Tucker the third.
Sub-Commander T'Pol.
TUCKER: Trip. I'm called Trip.
T'POL: I'll try to remember that.
ARCHER: While you may not share our enthusiasm about this mission, I
expect you to follow our rules. What's said in this room and out on
that Bridge is privileged information. I don't want every word I say
being picked apart the next day by the Vulcan High Command.
T'POL: My reason for being here is not espionage. My superiors simply
asked me to assist you.
ARCHER: Your superiors don't think we can flush a toilet without one of
you to assist us.
T'POL: I didn't request this assignment Captain, and you can be certain
that when the mission's over I'll be as pleased to leave this ship as
you'll be to have me go. (Porthos jumps up at her) If there's nothing
else?
ARCHER: That'll be all.
[Spacedock - view of Enterprise through
window]
FORREST: When Zefram Cochrane made his legendary
warp flight ninety years ago, and drew the attention of our new
friends, the Vulcans. We realised that we weren't alone in the galaxy.
Today we're about to cross a new threshold. For nearly a century, we've
waded ankle-deep in the ocean of space. Now it's finally time to swim.
(applause) The warp five engine wouldn't be a reality without men like
Doctor Cochrane and Henry Archer, who worked so hard to develop it. So
it's only fitting that Henry's son, Jonathan Archer, will command the
first starship powered by that engine. (applause as Archer and senior
officers leave) Rather than quoting Doctor Cochrane, I think we should
listen to his own words from the dedication ceremony for the Warp Five
Complex thirty two years ago.
COCHRANE [on screen] On this site, a powerful engine will be built. An
engine that will someday help us travel a hundred times faster than we
can today. (as the officers take their bridge stations) Imagine it.
Thousands of inhabited planets at our fingertips. And we'll be able to
explore those strange new worlds and seek out new life and new
civilizations. This engine will let us go boldly where no man has gone
before.
 [Bridge]
ARCHER: Take her out, Mister Mayweather. Straight
and steady.
(Umbilicals are released and Enterprise glides out of spacedock)
[Engineering]
ARCHER [OC]: How are we doing, Trip?
TUCKER: Ready when you are.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Prepare for warp.TRAVIS: Course laid in, sir. Request permission to
get underway.
T'POL: The coordinates are off by point two degrees.
ARCHER: Thank you. Let's go.
[Temporal Communication Chamber]
FUTURE MAN: Where's Klaang?
SILIK: The humans have him.
FUTURE MAN: Did you lose anyone else?
SILIK: Two of my soldiers were killed. One of them was a friend. Can
you prevent it?
FUTURE MAN: Our agreement doesn't provide for correcting mistakes.
Recover the evidence.
SILIK: I will, I promise you. When will we speak again?
FUTURE MAN: Don't be concerned with when.
[Sickbay]
ARCHER: Love what you've done with the place.
PHLOX: Those are immunocytic gel worms. Try not to shake them.
ARCHER: What'd you think of Earth?
PHLOX: Intriguing. I especially liked the Chinese food. Have you ever
tried it?
ARCHER: I've lived in San Francisco all my life.
PHLOX: Anatomically, you humans are somewhat simplistic, but what you
lack biologically you make up for with your charming optimism, not to
mention your egg drop soup. Be very careful with that.
ARCHER: What's in there?
PHLOX: An Altarian marsupial. Their droppings contain the greatest
concentration of regenerative enzymes found anywhere.
ARCHER: Their droppings?
PHLOX: If you're going to try to embrace new worlds you must try to
embrace new ideas. That's why the Vulcans initiated the Interspecies
Medical Exchange. There's a lot to be learned.
ARCHER: I'm sorry I had to take you away from your programme but, our
doctors haven't even heard of a Klingon.
PHLOX: Please, no apologies. What better time to study human beings
than when they're under pressure? It's a rare opportunity. And your
Klingon friend. I've never had a chance to examine a living one before.
ARCHER: Ensign Mayweather tells me we'll be to Kronos in about eighty
hours. Any chance he'll be conscious by then?
PHLOX: There's a chance he'll be conscious within the next ten minutes.
Just not a very good one.
ARCHER: Eighty hours, Doctor. If he doesn't walk off this ship on his
own two feet, he doesn't stand much of a chance.
PHLOX: I'll do the best I can. Optimism, Captain!
 [Jefferies tube]
 TUCKER: You're upside down, Ensign.
TRAVIS: (sitting on ceiling) Yes, sir.
TUCKER: Care to explain why?
TRAVIS: When I was a kid, we called it the sweet spot. Every ship's got
one.
TUCKER: Sweet spot?
TRAVIS: It's usually about halfway between the grav-generator and the
bow plate. Grab a hold of the hatch. No, on either side. Now push off.
Push off.
TUCKER: Wow! (finds himself in zero gravity before falling onto the
ceiling)
TRAVIS: It takes practice. Ever slept in zero G?
TUCKER: Slept?
TRAVIS: It's just like being back in the womb.
TUCKER: The Captain tells me you've been to Trillius Prime.
TRAVIS: It took the fourth, fifth and sixth grades to get there. I've
also been to Draylax and both the Denebian moons.
TUCKER: I've only been to one inhabited planet besides Earth. Nothing
there but dust-dwelling ticks. I've heard the women on Draylax have.
TRAVIS: Three. It's true.
TUCKER: You know that first-hand?
TRAVIS: First-hand, second-hand, third-hand.
TUCKER: I guess growing up a boomer has its advantages.
 [Mess hall]
 FLETCHER: Got an empty seat here, Commander.
TUCKER: Sorry. Dinner with the boss tonight.
 [Captain's mess]
 ARCHER: The Grand Canyon?
T'POL: No.
ARCHER: Big Sur Aquarium?
T'POL: Sightseeing was not one of my assignments.
ARCHER: All work and no play. Everyone should get out for a little fun
now and then.
T'POL: All our recreational needs are provided at the Compound.
ARCHER: Come in.
TUCKER: You should've started without me.
ARCHER: Sit down T'Pol tells me she's been living at the Vulcan
Compound in Sausalito.
TUCKER: No kidding. I lived a few blocks from there when I first joined
Starfleet. Great parties at the Vulcan Compound.
ARCHER: (as T'Pol tries to eat a bread stick with knife and fork) It
might be a little easier using your fingers.
T'POL: Vulcans don't touch food with their hands.
TUCKER: Can't wait to see you tackle the spare ribs.
ARCHER: Don't worry. We know you're a vegetarian.
TUCKER: Looks delicious. Tell Chef I said thanks.
STEWARD: Of course, sir.
T'POL: You humans claim to be enlightened, yet you still consume the
flesh of animals.
TUCKER: Grandma taught me never to judge a species by their eating
habits.
ARCHER: Enlightened may be too strong a word, but if you'd been on
Earth fifty years ago, I think you'd be impressed by what we've gotten
done.
T'POL: You have yet to embrace either patience or logic. You remain
impulsive carnivores.
TUCKER: Yeah? How about war, disease, hunger. Pretty much wiped 'em out
in less than two generations. I wouldn't call that small potatoes.
T'POL: It remains to be seen whether humanity will revert to its baser
instincts.
TUCKER: Well, we used to have cannibals on Earth. Who knows how far
we'll revert? Lucky this isn't a long mission.
ARCHER: Human instinct is pretty strong. You can't expect us to change
overnight.
T'POL: With proper discipline, anything's possible.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Warp four point three, sir.
REED: Not much of a change.
HOSHI: I don't know. Does anybody else feel that?
ARCHER: Feel what?
HOSHI: Those vibrations, like little tremors.
T'POL: You're imagining it.
ARCHER: Bring us to four four, Ensign.
HOSHI: There! What do you call that?
REED: The deflector's sequencing. It's perfectly normal.
T'POL: Perhaps you'd like to go to your quarters and lie down?
HOSHI: Ponfo mirann.
T'POL: I was instructed to speak English during this voyage, and I'd
appreciate it if you'd respect that.
ARCHER: It's easy to get a little jumpy when you're travelling at
thirty million kilometres a second. Should be old hat in a week's time.
Archer.
PHLOX [OC]: This is Doctor Phlox, Captain. Our patient is regaining
consciousness.
ARCHER: On my way. Hoshi.
 [Sickbay]
 KLAANG: Pung ghap! Pung ghap!
ARCHER: What's wrong?
HOSHI: The translator. It's not locking onto his dialect. The syntax
won't align.
KLAANG: DujDaj Hegh!
ARCHER: Tell him we're taking him home.
HOSHI: Ingan Hoch juH.
KLAANG: Tujpa'qyl Dun.
HOSHI: He wants to know who we are. Ou'ghewme Enterpise. PugloD.
KLAANG: Nenta lupHom.
HOSHI: LupHom. Ship. He's asking for his ship back.
ARCHER: Say it was destroyed.
HOSHI: SonchI.
KLAANG: Vengen Sto'vo'kor Dos!
HOSHI: I'm not sure, but I think he's saying something about eating the
afterlife?
ARCHER: Try the translator again.
HOSHI: I'm going to need to run what we've got through the phonetic
processor.
KLAANG: MajOa blmoHgu!
HOSHI: He says his wife has grown ugly? I'm sorry, Captain. I'm doing
the best I can.
PHLOX: Excuse me. His pre-frontal cortex is hyperstimulated. I doubt he
has any idea what he's saying.
KLAANG: HljolOaOqu'na!
HOSHI: I think the Doctor's right, Captain, unless stinky boots has
something to do with all this.
KLAANG: OaOgu'na!
HOSHI: That's the warp reactor again, right?
KLAANG: OaOgu'na!
ARCHER: Bridge, report.
T'POL [OC]: We've dropped out of warp, sir. Main power is (Everything
switches off.)
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: We're losing power on all decks.
REED: I think I just saw something off the starboard bow.
T'POL: What?
REED: I don't know. It might have just been the sensors going down.
(Aliens are crawling through the ship, along the bulkheads.)
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: Auxiliary power should have kicked in by
now. Do you know how to tell him to shut up?
HOSHI: Shut up! (but Klaang keeps talking)
ARCHER: You may have to sedate him. I need to get to the Bridge.
HOSHI: Captain! There's someone here. (All use flashlights to check
around until Archer spots one on the ceiling.)
ARCHER: Crewman! (He fires and misses.)
KLAANG: Suliban. (There is a fight, Archer picks up the fallen rifle and shoots
the alien. Another one falls from the ceiling onto Klaang. The lights
come back on to reveal an empty biobed and an alien corpse.)
 [Bridge]
ARCHER: We've got state of the art sensors. Why the
hell didn't we detect them?
TRAVIS: Mister Reed thought he detected something right before we lost
power.
REED: The starboard sensor logs recorded a spatial disturbance.
TUCKER: Looks more like a glitch.
HOSHI: Those weren't glitches in Sickbay.
ARCHER: I want a complete analysis of that disturbance. Where do we
stand on weapons?
REED: I still have to tune the targeting scanners.
ARCHER: What're you waiting for?
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: The Klingon seemed to know who they were. See if you can
translate what he said.
HOSHI: Right away.
T'POL: Captain. There's no way you could have anticipated this. I'm
sure Ambassador Soval will understand.
ARCHER: You're the Science Officer. Why don't you help Trip with that
analysis?
T'POL: The astrometric computer in San Francisco will be far more
effective.
ARCHER: We're not going to San Francisco, so make do with what we've
got here.
T'POL: You've lost the Klingon. Your mission is over.
ARCHER: I didn't lose the Klingon. He was taken, and I'm going to find
out who took him.
T'POL: How do you plan to do that? Space is very big, Captain. A shadow
on your sensors won't help you find them. This is a foolish mission.
ARCHER: Come with me.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: I'm not interested in what you think about
this mission so take your Vulcan cynicism and bury it along with your
repressed emotions.
T'POL: Your reaction to this situation is a perfect example of why your
species should remain in its own star system.
ARCHER: I've been listening to you Vulcans tell us what not to do all
my entire life. I watched my father work his ass off while your
scientists held back just enough information to keep him from
succeeding. He deserved to see that launch. You may have life spans of
two hundred years, we don't.
T'POL: You are going to be contacting Starfleet to advise them of our
situation.
ARCHER: No, I'm not. And neither are you. Now get the hell out there
and make yourself useful.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: What have you found, Doctor?
PHLOX: Mister Klaang was right about one thing. He's a Suliban. But
unless I'm mistaken, he's no ordinary one.
ARCHER: Meaning?
PHLOX: His DNA is Suliban but his anatomy has been altered. Look at
this lung. Five bronchial lobes, you see. It should only have three.
And look at the alveoli clusters. They've been modified to process
different kinds of atmospheres.
ARCHER: Are you saying he's some kind of a mutant?
PHLOX: Yes, I suppose I am, but this was no accident, no freak of
nature. This man was the recipient of some very sophisticated genetic
engineering. Watch this. Subcutaneous pigment sacs. A bio-mimetic
garment. And, the eyes are my favorite. Compound retinas. He most
likely saw things even your sensors couldn't detect.
ARCHER: It's not in their genome?
PHLOX: No, certainly not. The Suliban are no more evolved than humans.
It is very impressive work, though. I've never seen anything quite like
it.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: How about this?
T'POL: It's just background noise. Your sensors aren't capable of
isolating plasma decay.
TUCKER: How can you be so damn sure what our sensors can do?
T'POL: Vulcan children play with toys that are more sophisticated.
TUCKER: You know, some people say that you Vulcans do nothing but
patronise us, but if they were here now, if they could see how far
you're bending over backwards to help me, they'd eat their words.
T'POL: Your Captain's mission was to return the Klingon to his people.
He no longer has the Klingon.
TUCKER: I realize he's only a simple Earthling but did it ever occur to
you that he might know what he's doing? It's no secret Starfleet hasn't
been around too long. God knows you remind us of that every chance you
get, but does that mean the man who's been put in charge of this
mission doesn't deserve our support? Then again, loyalty's an emotion,
isn't it?
ARCHER: Any luck?
TUCKER: Not really.
T'POL: My analysis of the spatial disturbance Mister Reed saw indicates
a stealth vessel with a tricyclic plasma drive.
TUCKER: If we can figure out the decay rate of their plasma, we'll be
able to find their warp trail.
T'POL: Unfortunately, your sensors were not designed to measure plasma
decay.
HOSHI: Are you sure it's safe to stand so close to that?
ARCHER: What've you got?
HOSHI: I've managed to translate most of what Klaang said, but none of
it makes sense.
ARCHER: Nothing about the Suliban?
HOSHI: Nope.
ARCHER: Does that name ring a bell to you?
T'POL: They're a somewhat primitive species from Sector three six four
one, but they've never posed a threat.
ARCHER: Well, they have now. Did he say anything about Earth?
HOSHI: The word's not even in their database. It's all there. There
were only four words I couldn't translate. probably just proper nouns.
ARCHER: Jelik, Sarin, Rigel, Tholia. Anything sound familiar? T'Pol?
T'POL: Rigel is a planetary system approximately fifteen light years
from our present position.
ARCHER: Why the hesitation?
T'POL: According to the navigational logs salvaged from Klaang's ship,
Rigel ten was the last place he stopped before crashing on your planet.
ARCHER: Why do I get the feeling you weren't going to share that little
piece of information?
T'POL: I wasn't authorised to reveal the details of our findings.
ARCHER: The next time I learn you're withholding something, you're
going to spend the rest of this voyage confined to some very cramped
quarters. Understood? Archer to helm.
TRAVIS [OC]: Mayweather.
ARCHER: Go into the Vulcan star charts and find a system called Rigel,
then set a course for the tenth planet.
TRAVIS [OC}: Yes, sir.
 [Suliban Helix]
 SILIK: (in Klingon) Where is it? Where is it!
KLAANG: {Du bogh) I don't know.
SILIK: (Chonta qhe'tor. Q.a) We're not going to harm you. Tell me where
it is.
KLAANG: (Du Bogh) I don't know.
SILIK: Are you certain he's telling the truth?
DOCTOR: Absolutely certain. The drugs are working.
SILIK: {Hovme lupHom. Pente daO? Enterprise DaHjaj?) Did you leave it
on your ship? Is it on Enterprise?
KLAANG: {Du boqh guch)I don't know what you're looking for.
SILIK: {BiHeqh Rigel wo'tul) What were you doing on Rigel ten?
KLAANG: (MajQa tlharn) I was sent to meet someone.
SILIK: {Doh?) Who.
KLAANG: {MajQa rot. Sarin Poh nI) A Suliban female named Sarin.
SILIK: {Dah Sarin saj'Kogh?) And what did Sarin give you?
KLAANG: {RQgh) Nothing.
SILIK: Keep him alive while I'm gone.
 [Launch bay]
 ARCHER: As soon as we've tied down, we'll be
descending into the trade complex. It has thirty-six levels.
T'POL: Your translators have been programmed for Rigelian. However,
you'll encounter numerous other species. Many of them are known to be
impatient with newcomers. None of them have seen a human before. You
have a tendency to be gregarious. I suggest you try to restrain that
tendency.
TUCKER: You forgot to warn us about drinking the water.
T'POL: Doctor Phlox isn't concerned with the food and water, but he
does caution against intimate contact.
ARCHER: The Vulcans told us Klaang was a courier. If he was there to
get something, then whoever gave it to him might know why he was taken.
It was only a few days ago. A seven foot Klingon doesn't go unnoticed.
(The shuttlepod launches and descends through a blizzard to the landing
platform.)
 [Rigel Trade Complex]
(There are sounds coming from behind a
closed door.) TUCKER:  What in the world?
T'POL: It's nothing that concerns us.
 [deleted scene - Docking
Control Centre]
 DOCK MASTER: Five or six days ago? Do you
realise how much traffic we process in a single day?
ARCHER: This was a one man Klingon scout ship.
DOCK MASTER: What species are you?
ARCHER: Humans. We're called humans.
DOCK MASTER: (responding to alarm) Elkan nine, raise your approach
vector by point two radiants. It was seven days ago. A K'toch class
vessel.
ARCHER: Does it say who he was here to see?
DOCK MASTER: What is says is that he arrived at docking port six and
was given a level one biohazard clearance.
ARCHER: You don't seem to be very interested in what people do here.
DOCK MASTER: Our visitors value their privacy. It wouldn't be very
tusoropko tuprova pro the business they're in.
HOSHI: It's all right. Rigelian uses a pronominal base. The
translator's just reprocessing the syntax.
ARCHER: Do you have any records of a Suliban vessel coming in around
the same time?
DOCK MASTER: Suliban. I don't know that word. Your device must still be
malfunctioning. 
 [Rigel Trade Complex]
 (Elsewhere, Reed and Travis are gawping at two
females eating butterflies with very prehensile tongues.)
ALIEN: Would you like to meet them? I can arrange it.
TRAVIS: Is this where you saw Klaang?
ALIEN: I'll show you where, but first you should enjoy yourselves.
Which one would you prefer?
TRAVIS: We should get going.
REED: Are those real butterflies, or some kind of holograms?
TRAVIS: Sir.
REED: Yes. Absolutely. Right.
(Tucker and T'Pol are in a waiting room with lots of other people. One
woman is dealing with a child who keeps needing to use a respirator)
T'POL: T'Pol to Archer.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
TUCKER: Hey.
T'POL: Central Security claims to have no record of Klaang, but they
told me about an enclave on level nineteen where Klingons have been
known to go. Something about live food.
ARCHER [OC]: Where on level nineteen?
T'POL: The easternmost subsection, by the geothermal shafts.
ARCHER [OC]: I'll meet you there as soon as I can. Archer out.
TUCKER: (watching as the woman keeps taking the respirator away from
the child, who starts gasping each time) What are you doing? Leave the
kid alone!
T'POL: Don't get involved.
TUCKER: Do you see what she's doing? He's going to suffocate!
T'POL: They're Lorillians. Before the age of four, they can only
breathe methyloxide. The mother is simply weaning her son.
TUCKER: Could've fooled me.
T'POL: Humans can't refrain from drawing conclusions. You should learn
to objectify other cultures, so you know when to interfere, and when
not to.
[deleted scene] 
ALIEN: Gentlemen, gentlemen. Perhaps you would prefer to watch the
inter-species performance?
TRAVIS: You don't know anything about Klaang, do you.
ALIEN: Of course I do, but there's no reason to hurry.
REED: Inter-species performance?
TRAVIS: Lieutenant, this man has no intention of helping us.
REED: Perhaps another time.
TRAVIS: (as they walk away) I can't believe we fell for that.
REED: We are explorers. 
 [Level nineteen}
 HOSHI: Isn't an enclave supposed to have people?
ARCHER: Enclave can mean a lot of things.
HOSHI: T'Pol said something about live food. I don't see any
restaurants.
ARCHER: Hello! Excuse me!
HOSHI: Ha'quj jeg! They looked Klingon to me.
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol. T'Pol, come in.
HOSHI: Maybe we should get back to where there are more people.
ARCHER: There are plenty of people right here. (He powers up his phase pistol.)
ARCHER: Stay behind me.
(They get jumped by a group of Suliban and hustled away. Hoshi is put
into a holding area with Tucker and T'Pol while Archer is taken away. Elsewhere -)SARIN: You're looking for Klaang. Why?
ARCHER: Who the hell are you?
SARIN: My name is Sarin. Tell me about the people who took Klaang off
your ship.
ARCHER: I was hoping you could tell me. They looked a lot like your
friends outside.
SARIN: Where were you taking him?
ARCHER: How come you don't look like your friends?
SARIN: Would you prefer I did?
ARCHER: What I'd prefer is that you give me Klaang back.
SARIN: So you could take him where?
ARCHER: Home. We were just taking him home. You'd better be careful.
I'm a lot bigger than you are.
SARIN: If you're thinking about harming me, I'd advise against it.
ARCHER: What are you doing?
SARIN: Why were you taking Klaang home?
ARCHER: You know, under different circumstances, I might be flattered
by this, but.(She kisses him, then her skin changes from human to
Suliban mottled) ARCHER: That's never happened before.
SARIN: I've been given the ability to measure trust, but it requires
close contact.
ARCHER: You're Suliban
SARIN: I'm a member of the Cabal, but not any longer. The price of
evolution was too high.
ARCHER: Evolution?
SARIN: Some of my people are so anxious to improve themselves that
they've lost perspective.
ARCHER: So you know I'm not lying to you. Now what?
SARIN: Klaang was carrying a message to his people.
ARCHER: How do you know that?
SARIN: I gave it to him.
ARCHER: What kind of message?
SARIN: The Suliban have been staging attacks within the Klingon Empire,
making it appear that one faction is attacking another. Klaang was
bringing proof of this to his High Council. Without that proof, the
Empire could be thrown into chaos.
ARCHER: Why would the Suliban want that?
SARIN: The Cabal doesn't make decisions on its own. They're simply
soldiers fighting a Temporal Cold War.
ARCHER: Temporal? You've lost me.
SARIN: They're taking orders from the distant future.
ARCHER: What?
SARIN: We can help you find Klaang but we don't have a starship. You'll
have to take us with you. (Weapons fire. They head for cover and return
fire. Sarin releases the others and gives them their weapons back.)SARIN:  Where's your vessel?
ARCHER: On the roof. Docking port three.
SARIN: This way.
(As they head onto an elevator platform, Silik shoots Sarin in the
back)
ARCHER: Trip!
SARIN: Find Klaang. (Sarin dies)
 [Rooftop]
 HOSHI: Where's the pod?
TUCKER: Over here!
T'POL: No, it's this way!
ARCHER: (accepting T'Pol's direction) Come on! Lieutenant Reed, this is
Archer. Come in.
REED [OC]: You're breaking up, can't read.
ARCHER: We're on the roof. You need to get up here as quickly
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER [OC]: as you can.
REED: We've been trying to reach you, Captain. We're back in the
shuttle.
TRAVIS: Ask him where they are. This storm's getting worse.
REED: Captain, what's your location? The weather is definitely
 [Rooftop]
 (Nothing but static coming over the communicator.)
HOSHI: Great!
TUCKER: Like I said, it's back there.
(Weapons fire. They dive for cover)
 [Shuttlepod]
 REED: I've never seen lightning in a snowstorm
before.
TRAVIS: The storm's kicking up too much interference. I can't isolate
human biosigns. They could be anywhere in the complex.
REED: Try Vulcan biosigns.
TRAVIS: (looking out of window) I found her.
(They take off, and fly over to the fight. T'Pol slips and falls in the
snow when she gets out again.)
 [Rooftop]
 ARCHER: Get Hoshi to the ship. Now! (He runs over to
give T'Pol cover.) ARCHER: Go!
T'POL: Enterprise needs its Captain! Give me the weapons!
ARCHER: I said go!
(She obeys but Archer gets shot in the leg. The two men drag him safely
aboard.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 TRAVIS: The starboard thruster's down!
T'POL: Ignore it. Take us up.
[Rooftop]
 SILIK: We need instructions.
 [Shuttlepod]
 T'POL: Open a channel. Sub-Commander T'Pol to
Enterprise.
CREWMAN [OC]: Go ahead.
T'POL: We'll be docking in four minutes. Have Doctor Phlox meet us in
decon.
CREWMAN [OC]: Acknowledged. Is someone wounded?
T'POL: The Captain. I'm taking command of Enterprise.
 [Archer's memory - beach]
 (The radio controlled model spaceship is now in
flight.)
JONATHAN: I can't do it!
FATHER: Yes, you can. Take her up, straight and steady. (Instead, it
nose-dives into the sand.)
JONATHAN: Damn.
FATHER: You can't be afraid of the wind. Learn to trust it.
 [Decon chamber]
(The doctor is watching through window as
Tucker and T'Pol undress.)  PHLOX: It shouldn't take more than a few moments.
TUCKER: Is this really necessary?
PHLOX: The others scanned negative. You two, unfortunately, were
exposed to a protocystian spore. I've loaded the appropriate decon gel
into compartment B.
T'POL: Tell Mister Mayweather to prepare to leave orbit.
TUCKER: How's the Captain?
PHLOX: I'm treating his wound.
TUCKER: Will he be all right?
PHLOX: Eventually.
(The pair start smearing gel over themselves and each other.)
TUCKER: Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you just kind of an
observer on this mission? I don't remember anyone telling me you were a
member of Starfleet.
T'POL: My Vulcan rank supersedes yours.
TUCKER: Apples and oranges. This is an Earth vessel. You're in no
position to take command.
T'POL: As soon as we're through here, I'll contact Ambassador Soval.
He'll speak to your superiors and I'm certain they'll support my
authority in this situation.
TUCKER: You must really be proud of yourself. You can put an end to
this mission while the Captain's still unconscious in Sickbay. You
won't even have to look him in the eye.
T'POL: Your precious cargo was stolen. three Suliban, perhaps more,
were killed, and Captain Archer has been seriously wounded. It seems to
me this mission has put an end to itself. Turn around.
TUCKER: Let's say you're right. Let's say we screwed up just like you
always knew we would. It's still a pretty good bet that whoever blew
that hole in the Captain's leg is connected somehow to the people who
took Klaang.
T'POL: I fail to see your point.
TUCKER: Captain Archer deserves a chance to see this through. If you
knew him, you'd realise that's what he's about. He needs to finish what
he starts. His daddy was the same way.
T'POL: You obviously share your Captain's belief that my people were
responsible for impeding Henry Archer's accomplishments.
TUCKER: He only wanted to see his engine fly. They never even gave him
a chance to fail. Here you are, thirty years later, proving just how
consistent you Vulcans can be.
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox removing a creature from Archer's leg.) PHLOX: Very nice, very nice. Your myofibres are fusing beautifully.
ARCHER: How long have?
PHLOX: Less than six hours. I thought it best to keep you sedated while
the osmotic eel cauterized your wound.
ARCHER: Thanks.
TUCKER: How are you doing, Captain?
ARCHER: That depends. What's been going on the last six hours?
T'POL: As your highest ranking officer I assumed command while you were
incapacitated.
ARCHER: Are we underway? (Tucker nods) You didn't waste much time, did
you?
T'POL: Is he fit to resume command?
PHLOX: As long as he returns for more eel therapy tomorrow.
ARCHER: How long before we get back to Earth?
TUCKER: Earth, sir?
T'POL: We're currently tracking the Suliban vessel that left Rigel
shortly after you were injured.
ARCHER: You got their plasma decay rate?
T'POL: With Mister Tucker's assistance, I modified the sensors. You now
have the resolution to detect their warp trail.
ARCHER: What happened to this is a foolish mission?
T'POL: It is a foolish mission. The Suliban are clearly a hostile race
with technology far superior to yours, but as acting Captain, I was
obligated to anticipate your wishes.
ARCHER: As acting Captain, you could've done whatever the hell you
wanted to do.
T'POL: I should return to the Bridge.
ARCHER: Dismissed. (T'Pol leaves.)
TUCKER: Modifying the sensors was her idea, sir.
 [deleted scene - Bridge]
 HOSHI: (at a panel behind Reed's station)
What are the symptoms of frostbite?
REED: Your appendages blister, peel and turn gangrenous.
HOSHI: I think I have frostbite.
REED: Let me see. (takes her hands) Doctor Phlox may have to amputate.
HOSHI: I never had to worry about frostbite in Brazil.
TRAVIS: They're getting too far ahead of us.
T'POL: Match their speed.
TRAVIS: I'm not authorised to go beyond four four.
 [deleted scene - Engineering]
 TUCKER: Engineering.
T'POL [OC]: Mister Tucker.
 [deleted scene - Bridge]
 T'POL: Would you please give the helmsman
permission to go to warp four point five.
 [deleted scene - Engineering]
 TUCKER: It's okay, Travis. I'll keep an
eye on the engine. 
 [Archer's quarters]
 ARCHER: Enterprise Starlog, Captain Jonathan
Archer. April 16th, 2151. We've been tracking the Suliban ship for ten
hours, thanks to our Science Officer, who came up with a way to tweak
the sensors. Computer, pause. I save her life, and now she's helping us
with the mission. One good turn deserves another doesn't sound very
Vulcan. Resume log. I have no reason to believe that Klaang is still
alive but if what the Suliban woman told me is true, it's crucial that
we try to find him. Computer, pause. (to Porthos) Have you ever known a
Vulcan to return a favour? No, neither have I. Resume log. I still
haven't decided whether to ask Sub-Commander T'Pol about this Temporal
Cold War. My instincts tell me not to trust her. Computer, pause.
Archer to T'Pol. Report.
T'POL [OC]: If you're feeling well enough to come to the Bridge,
Captain, now would be a good time.
 [Bridge]
 (A large orange planet fills the viewscreen.)
T'POL: It's a gas giant.
ARCHER: From the looks of it, a class six or seven.
T'POL: Class seven. The Suliban vessel dropped to impulse a few hours
ago and altered course. Their new heading took them through its outer
radiation belt.
ARCHER: We've lost them.
T'POL: Yes.
ARCHER: Move us in closer. Anything?
REED: The radiation's dissipated their warp trail. I'm only picking up
fragments.
ARCHER: You finished helping us?
T'POL: Lieutenant, run a spectral analysis of the fragments.
REED: There's too much distortion. The decay rates don't even match.
T'POL: Calculate the trajectory of each fragment.
REED: Sir?
ARCHER: You heard her. Recalibrate the sensor array. Narrow band, short
to mid range.
CREWMAN: Aye, sir.
T'POL: Measure the particle density of the thermosphere.
ARCHER: Your instincts were right. Those fragments weren't from one
Suliban ship
T'POL: They were from fourteen, and all within the last six hours. I
believe we have found what we're looking for.
ARCHER: How are your targeting scanners?
REED: Aligned and ready, sir.
ARCHER: Bring the weapons online and polarise the hull plating. Lay in
a sixty degree vector. We're going in.
 [Temporal communication chamber]
 FUTURE MAN: Did Sarin give them anything?
SILIK: I don't know.
FUTURE MAN: What do you know?
SILIK: They followed us here.
FUTURE MAN: Looking for Klaang, or for you?
SILIK: I don't know but I will destroy them before they locate the
Helix.
FUTURE MAN: We didn't plan to involve the humans or the Vulcans. Not
yet. Sarin's message cannot reach Kronos. If the humans have it, you
must stop them.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: Sensor resolution's falling off at about
twelve kilometres.
ARCHER: Travis?
TRAVIS: I'm okay, Captain
T'POL: Our situation should improve. We're about to break through the
cyclohexane layer.
ARCHER: (ship shudders) I wouldn't exactly call this an improvement.
T'POL: Liquid phosphorous. I wouldn't have expected that beneath a
layer of cyclohexane.
HOSHI: You might think about recommending seat belts when we get home.
ARCHER: It's just a little bad weather. (they move into a clear layer)
HOSHI: We've got sensors.
ARCHER: Level off. Go to long range scans.
T'POL: I'm detecting two vessels bearing one one nine mark seven.
ARCHER: Put it up.
REED: Impulse and warp engines.
ARCHER: What kind of weapons?
REED: We're too far away.
TRAVIS: Sir, I'm picking up something at three forty two mark twelve.
It's a lot bigger.
ARCHER: (viewscreen shows a spacedock type structure) All sensors. Get
whatever you can. Go tighter. Bio-signs?
HOSHI: Over three thousand, but I can't isolate a Klingon. If there is
one. (weapons fire hits Enterprise)
REED: That was a particle weapon, sir.
TUCKER [OC]: Bridge, we're taking
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: damage down here. What's going on?
ARCHER [OC]: Just a little
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: trouble with the bad guys.
T'POL: I suggest we return to the phosphorous layer.
ARCHER: Take us up.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: What've you got?
T'POL: It appears to be an aggregate structure comprised of hundreds of
vessels. They're held in place by an interlocking system of magnetic
seals.
HOSHI: There, right there. These bio-readings are not Suliban.
T'POL: We can't be certain they're Klingon.
ARCHER: Even if it is Klaang, we'd have a tough time getting him out of
there
REED: We could always try the transporting device.
ARCHER: We've risked too much to bring him back inside out. Would the
grappler work in a liquid atmosphere?
REED: I believe so.
ARCHER: Bring it online. One more time, Mister Mayweather.
(Enterprise descends into the clear air, exchanging weapons fire with
the small pods)
REED: The ventral plating's down!
ARCHER: Hold your position.
REED: The lead ship's closing. Seven thousand metres. Six thousand.
T'POL: We should ascend.
ARCHER: Hold your position.
REED: One thousand metres. Forward plating's offline.
ARCHER: Now, Mister Reed.
(a turret comes out from Enterprise's underside and fires two grappling
hooks at the pod then quickly reels it in. The pilot ejects with just a
parachute)
REED: The ship's in the launch bay.
 [Situation room]
 TUCKER: Ask me another one.
TRAVIS: All right. What's this?
TUCKER: The pitch control.
TRAVIS: No, that's the pitch control. This is the guidance system.
TUCKER: Pitch control. Guidance system. Got it.
TRAVIS: The docking interface. How do you deploy it?
ARCHER: Release the inertial clamps here, here, and here then
initialize the coaxial ports.
TRAVIS: Good. Where's the auxiliary throttle?
TUCKER: Hmm. It's not this one
TRAVIS: With all due respect to Commander Tucker, I'm pretty sure I
could fly this thing, sir.
ARCHER: I don't doubt it, but I need you here.
TUCKER: There, that's it. The auxiliary throttle.
T'POL: Captain, That charge contained a proximity sweep. If we remain
here, they're going to locate us.
ARCHER: You're gonna have to speed this up a little, Travis.
TUCKER: How complicated can it be? Up, down, forward, reverse. We'll
figure it out.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: We'll be back before you know it. Have
Mayweather plot a course for Kronos.
T'POL: There's a Vulcan ship less than two days away. It's illogical to
attempt this alone.
ARCHER: I was beginning to think you understood why we have to do this
alone.
T'POL: You'll have other opportunities to demonstrate your independence.
ARCHER: Never put off 'til tomorrow.
T'POL: You both could be killed.
ARCHER: Am I sensing concern? Last time I checked, that was considered
an emotion.
T'POL: If anything happens to either of you, the Vulcan High Command
will hold me responsible.
ARCHER: Come in. You finished?
REED: Sir. (Reed opens a case to reveal its contents.) REED: This should reverse the
polarity of any
mag-lock within a hundred
metres. Once you've set the sequence, you'll have five seconds. One
more thing. (He opens a second case.)
ARCHER: Ah. Our new weapons.
REED: They're called phase pistols. They have two settings, stun and
kill. It would be best not to confuse them.
ARCHER: Time to go. The ship is yours.
(The Suliban pod is launched)
[Suliban pod]
ARCHER: What's that?
TUCKER: Travis said not to worry about that panel.
ARCHER: That's reassuring.
[Bridge]
REED: Hold on.
TRAVIS: That one was a lot closer.
REED: If we change our position, they'll have to start from scratch.
T'POL: If we change our position, the Captain will have no way of
finding us.
[Suliban pod]
TUCKER: I think we're there.
ARCHER: Bring the docking interface online. The coaxial ports.
TUCKER: Open.
ARCHER: Let's go.
TUCKER: Where is it? It was right here.
ARCHER: Bank starboard, ninety degrees.
TUCKER: There you are.
ARCHER: That's the upper support radius. Drop down right below it.
Start a counter clockwise sweep. A little more. A little more. (they
bump another pod) Right there.
[Suliban Helix]
(They dock, the front hatch opens and they get out
with their case of gizmos.)
ARCHER: (firing at a passing Suliban) Stun seems to work.
[Bridge]
HOSHI: (wincing from noise in her earpiece) Grab on
to something. (A big bang rocks the ship.)
REED: This is ridiculous! If we don't move the ship, Captain Archer
won't have anything to look for when he gets back.
T'POL: We're going to need that ear of yours. Move us away five
kilometres.
TRAVIS: In what direction?
T'POL: Any direction.
[Suliban Helix]
(Klaang is strapped to a chair with wires attached
to him.)
TUCKER: This is going be easier than I thought. It's okay. We're
getting you off this thing. (Archer points his weapon as Klaang pushes Tucker away and growls.) ARCHER: I
really don't want to have to carry you out of here. You okay? I think
he gets the idea. Give him a hand.
[Suliban Helix corridor]
KLAANG: Qu'taw bob.
ARCHER: Be quiet.
(Klaang mutters as they take cover from Suliban weapons.)
TUCKER: You tell him, big guy.
ARCHER: Give me the box. (Klaang goes hand to hand with a Suliban.)TUCKER: Thanks.
ARCHER: Get to the ship. I'll be right behind you. (He sets the magnetic
unlocking device, then discovers just how many pieces the structure is
really made of. Forcefields activate to stop atmosphere escaping, and
thousands of pods fall off a central spacedock shaped structure.)
{Suliban pod]
TUCKER: Captain?
ARCHER [OC]: It worked, Trip.
TUCKER: Where are you?
[Suliban Helix]
ARCHER: Still on the central core. Get Klaang back
to Enterprise.
[Suliban pod]
TUCKER: What about you, sir?
ARCHER [OC]: Get him to the ship. You can come back for me.
TUCKER: It's going to be hard to isolate your biosigns, so stay as far
away from the Suliban.
[Suliban Helix]
TUCKER [OC]: As you can.
ARCHER: Believe me, I'll try.
[Suliban pod]
KLAANG: RaQ'o jadICH!
TUCKER: I don't particularly like the way you smell, either.
KLAANG: MajQa!
TUCKER: I don't get it, this is right where they're supposed to be.
[Bridge]
REED: The charges are getting closer again.
T'POL: Another five kilometres, Lieutenant.
TRAVIS: At this rate, the Captain'll never find us.
HOSHI: Wait a minute, I think I've got something.
T'POL: Amplify it.
HOSHI: It's Commander Tucker.
REED: All I hear is noise.
HOSHI: It's just a narrow notch in the mid-range. He says he's about to
ignite his thruster exhaust.
T'POL: Coordinates, one fifty eight mark one three.
TRAVIS: Laid in.
T'POL: Ahead, fifty kph. (to Hoshi) Shaya tonat.
HOSHI: You're welcome.
TRAVIS: Two kilometres, dead ahead.
T'POL: Initiate docking procedures.
HOSHI: I'm only picking up two bio-signs. One Klingon, one human.
(Archer follows some strange readings and finds
himself at the end of a corridor. A door closes behind him, there's
strobing lights then a door in front opens. As he walks in, he notices
there's a echo effect with his movements)
[Bridge]
TUCKER: Turn this ship around. Now.
T'POL: Our mission is to return the Klingon to his homeworld. Another
rescue attempt could
jeopardize that mission.
TUCKER: The Captain specifically told us to come back for him.
T'POL: As Commanding Officer, it's my job to interpret the Captain's
orders.
TUCKER: I just told you his orders. What's there to interpret?
T'POL: Captain Archer may very well have told you to return for him
later because he knew how stubborn you can be.
TUCKER: What the hell is that supposed to mean?
T'POL: You might've risked Klaang's life in a foolish attempt to swing
back and rescue the Captain.
TUCKER: I can't believe this!
T'POL: The situation must be analysed logically.
TUCKER: I don't remember the Captain analyzing anything when he went
back for you on that roof.
T'POL: That is a specious analogy.
TUCKER: Is it.
 [Temporal communication room]
 SILIK [OC]: You're wasting your time. Klaang knows
nothing. It would be unwise to discharge that weapon in this room.
ARCHER: What is this room? What goes on in here?
SILIK [OC]: You're very curious, Jon. May I call you Jon?
ARCHER: Am I supposed to be impressed that you know my name?
SILIK [OC]: I've learned a great deal about you. Even more than you
know.
ARCHER: Well, I guess you have me at a disadvantage. So why don't you
drop this invisible man routine and let me see who I'm talking to?
 [Bridge]
 REED: Hull plating's been re-polarised.
T'POL: Stand by impulse engines. Mister Tucker, status.
 [Transporter alcove]
 TUCKER: The auto-sequencer's online but annular
confinement's still off by two microns.
T'POL [OC]: That should suffice.
TUCKER: Easy for you to say.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: If the Suliban have re-established their
defences, we'll have no other option.
 [Temporal communication chamber]
 SILIK [OC]: You wouldn't have come looking for
Klaang if Sarin had told you what she knew. That means you're no threat
to me Jon, but I do need you to leave this room. (door opens) Now.
ARCHER: This chameleon thing is pretty fancy. Was it payment for
pitting the Klingons against each other, or a trophy from your Temporal
Cold War.
SILIK: (knocks Archer down and takes his phase pistol) I was going to
let you go.
ARCHER: Really? Then you obviously don't know as much about me as you
thought you did.
SILIK: On the contrary. I could've told you what day you were going to
die but I suppose that's about to change. (Silik fires the phase pistol, but the
beam is so slow Archer easily avoids it. Instead it hits the wall and a
shockwave knocks Silik down instead.)
ARCHER: (getting his weapon back) What's the matter? No genetic tricks
to keep you from getting knocked on your butt?
SILIK: What you call tricks we call progress. Are you aware that your
genome is almost identical to that of an ape? The Suliban don't share
humanity's patience with natural selection.
ARCHER: So to speed things up a little, you struck a deal with the
devil.
(He gets Silik to fire at the door, then dashes out. They both end up
fighting in the strobing room. Meanwhile Enterprise is flying back to
the Helix)
 [Bridge]
 REED: We have four more coming up off starboard.
T'POL: Can we dock, Ensign?
TRAVIS: These aren't ideal conditions.
T'POL: Mister Tucker, we're going to plan B. (Archer finally manages to
struggle free of Silik's grasp and runs as a weapon is aimed at his
back) T'POL: Now!
 [Transporter alcove]
 TUCKER: Bridge, we've got him! Sorry, Captain. We
had no other choice.
[Klingon High Council Chamber]
CHANCELLOR: Malja'gor. (The door opens to reveal
Klaang, with Archer, T'Pol and Hoshi.)
KLAANG: Wo'migh Oagh! Q'ala.
HOSHI: Something about disgracing the Empire. He says he's ready to
die. (The Chancellor walks up to Klaang, draws a knife and cuts his palm.)
CHANCELLOR: Pog!
(An aide catches Klaang's blood in a vial, goes over to a machine and
calls up a magnified image on a screen. There in the DNA strands are
computer-style data.)
CHANCELLOR: ChugDah hegh. Volcha va.
ARCHER: I'll take that as a thank you.
HOSHI: I don't think they have a word for thank you.
ARCHER: What did he say?
HOSHI: You don't want to know.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: Come in. I've just gotten a response to the
message I sent to Admiral Forrest. He enjoyed telling the Vulcan High
Command about the Suliban we ran into. It isn't every day he gets to be
the one dispensing information. I wanted you both to hear Starfleet's
orders before I inform the crew.
TUCKER: Orders?
ARCHER: Your people are sending a transport to pick you up.
T'POL: I was under the impression that Enterprise would be taking me
back to Earth.
ARCHER: It would be a little out of our way. Admiral Forrest sees no
reason why we shouldn't keep going.
TUCKER: Son of a bitch.
ARCHER: I have a feeling Doctor Phlox won't mind staying around for a
while. He's developing a fondness for the human endocrine system.
TUCKER: I'll get double shifts on the repair work.
ARCHER: I think that outer hull's going to need a little patching up.
Let's hope that's the last time somebody takes a shot at us.
TUCKER: Let's hope. (leaves)
ARCHER: T'Pol, would you stick around for a minute? Ever since I can
remember, I've seen Vulcans as an obstacle, always keeping us from
standing on our own two feet.
T'POL: I understand.
ARCHER: No, I don't think you do. If I'm going to pull this off, there
are a few things I have to leave behind. Things like preconceptions,
holding grudges. This mission would've failed without your help.
T'POL: I won't dispute that.
ARCHER: I was thinking. A Vulcan Science Officer could come in handy,
but if I asked you to stay it might look like I wasn't ready to do this
on my own.
T'POL: Perhaps you should add pride to your list.
ARCHER: Perhaps I should.
T'POL: It might be best if I were to contact my superiors and make the
request myself. With your permission.
ARCHER: Permission granted.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: I hope nobody is in a big hurry to get
home. Starfleet seems to think that we're ready to begin our mission.
I understand there's an inhabited planet a few light years from here.
REED: We've detected it, sir. Sensors show a nitrogen sulfide
atmosphere.
HOSHI: Probably not humanoids?
ARCHER: That's what we're here to find out. Prepare to break orbit and
lay in a course.
TRAVIS: I'm reading an ion storm on that trajectory, sir. Should I go
around it?
ARCHER: We can't be afraid of the wind, Ensign. Take us to warp four.
(A young boy and his proud father watch as the model spaceship flies
straight and true in the coastal breeze.)

  [Sickbay]
 (Hoshi is clucking at a slug in a plastic box)
PHLOX: I didn't realise you spoke slug.
HOSHI: Wish I did. She doesn't look any better, does she.
PHLOX: She? We haven't been able to determine its gender yet, if it has
one.
HOSHI: I should have left her where I found her.
PHLOX: Nonsense. You're on a mission of exploration. There's something
to be learned from every lifeform.
HOSHI: She wasn't meant to be in this environment.
PHLOX: I promise to do my best to keep it alive.
HOSHI: He's going to make you all better.
PHLOX: Actually I was thinking more about my pyrithian bat. He won't
eat anything once it's dead.
TUCKER: We've routed some more power to Sickbay. Let me know if it's
enough.
PHLOX: This should do fine.
TUCKER: How's sluggo?
HOSHI: Doctor Phlox thinks this argon lamp should help. She's barely
moved all day.
TUCKER: We've been out here for two weeks and the only first contact
we've made is with a dying worm.
 [Ready room]
 (Archer reacts to a strange squeak.)
ARCHER: Come in.
T'POL: Scans of the sectors ahead.
ARCHER: Shush. Hear that?
T'POL: Hear what?
ARCHER: A squeak. Something's squeaking. I think it's coming from under
the deck plating, but every time I get close to it, it stops. If I
can't isolate it I'm going to have to tear the whole flooring up.
T'POL: That would be unfortunate. The scans of the sectors ahead
indicate little chance of finding inhabited planets.
ARCHER: How about the Vulcan star charts?
T'POL: We have limited data on the course Starfleet has assigned you.
ARCHER: There are thousands of star systems along this path. There must
have been something that piqued your people's interest. A sentient
species, a trinary star cluster.
T'POL: We don't select our destinations by what piques our interest.
ARCHER: Vulcans always need a logical and pragmatic reason.
T'POL: My people don't share your enthusiasm for exploration. (squeak)
Space is vast, Captain. (Archer puts his ear to the floor to listen.)
T'POL: I'm sure you're aware that only one out of every forty three thousand
planets supports intelligent life.
ARCHER: I took exobiology, I know the statistics, but we're travelling
at warp five. There's got to be someone out here. Come in. (squeak)
HOSHI: I'm sorry.
T'POL: I'll leave you to your exploring. (T'pol leaves.)
ARCHER: Trip tells me that sluggo's not faring too well.
HOSHI: No, sir, but the Doctor's doing the best he can. Sir, my
quarters are on E deck, starboard section five.
ARCHER: Yes.
HOSHI: The stars are going the wrong way, sir.
ARCHER: Wrong way?
HOSHI: On both my training tours, I had port side quarters. I'm having
trouble sleeping.
ARCHER: Because you're on the
HOSHI: The wrong side of the ship, yes, sir. I spoke with Ensign
Porter. He said he's be willing to switch, with your permission.
ARCHER: You got it. Can't have my comm. officer falling asleep on the
Bridge.
HOSHI: I appreciate it, Captain.
ARCHER: Is there something else, Hoshi?
HOSHI: No, sir. Thank you. (Hoshi leaves. Squeak.)
 [Armoury]
 REED: Ready.
TRAVIS: Fore and aft target scanners are aligned.
REED: Activating simulation J6. Target acquired.
TRAVIS: Simulated launch.
REED: Five seconds to impact. Three, two, one. (It misses.) REED: Wonderful.
TRAVIS: We're only off by three metres.
REED: Only three metres. Three metres could mean the difference between
hitting a weapons port and a warp core. Instead of disabling a vessel
we'd end up destroying it, and probably ourselves in the process.
TRAVIS: We'll get it right.
REED: All this should have been dealt with before we left Earth. Have
they detected any inhabited planets or vessels?
TRAVIS: Not yet.
REED: Good.
TRAVIS: I hope you don't expect everyone we run into out here to be
hostile. In twenty three years I don't think my folks ran into a
problem more than a half dozen times.
REED: I don't believe you were ever out quite this far.
TRAVIS: Do you think that makes a difference?
REED: All I do know is until we get these targeting scanners working
properly, the further we are from everyone else, the better.
TRAVIS: Seems like everybody else on board is itching for a first
contact.
ARCHER: How's it going?
REED: Not well, sir. We've corrected the problem but we're still off by
point oh two percent. It's unacceptable.
ARCHER: Are you sure it's not the simulations that are off?
REED: There's only one way to find out.
ARCHER: How long would it take to arm a few torpedoes?
REED: Moments, sir.
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol.
T'POL [OC]: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: Prepare to drop out of warp. It's time for a little target
practice.
T'POL [OC]: Acknowledged.
REED: Thank you, Captain.
ARCHER: Come on, Travis. We've got to find Mister Reed something to
blow up.
 [Deleted scene - Corridor]
 ARCHER: Try to locate an asteroid field,
a comet. Just do it quickly, I want to get back to warp.
TRAVIS: Yes, sir. We made a trip once from Livinius to Belarn Prime.
Two and a half light years. Nearly nine months without running into a
soul. There were five kids on board. We were at each others throats
within a matter of weeks. First officer and my mother came up with the
idea to teach us how to play geography. You know, you say Amazon River,
which ends in an R. I say Rhode Island.
ARCHER: Which ends in a D. Dralax.
TRAVIS: X, X.
ARCHER: Now there's always
TRAVIS: Don't tell me, I know an X. Xanadu.
ARCHER: That's not a real place.
TRAVIS: Doesn't matter.
ARCHER: Of course it matters.
TRAVIS: Well, you used an alien planet, Dralax.
ARCHER: (as they get into the turbolift) I thought you said this game
kept you from arguing. 
 [Bridge]
 (A torpedo sails serenely past an asteroid.)
ARCHER: Load another one. Let's try again.
REED: Rotate the targeting axis by point five microns.
TRAVIS: Point five microns.
(This torpedo grazes the asteroid and bounces off, then heads back
towards Enterprise.)
ARCHER: Mister Reed. (Reed gets it to self-destruct in time.)
REED: If I refocus the infrared scanner, I might be able to compensate.
ARCHER: How long will that take?
REED: The better part of a day.
ARCHER: Resume course, Ensign.
REED: Sir.
ARCHER: We're not going to sit on our butt for twenty four hours. Make
your modifications. We'll run another test first chance we get.
 [Mess hall]
 TUCKER: Anyone sitting here?
PHLOX: No. Please, sit down, sit down.
TUCKER: Sluggo any better?
PHLOX: I'm afraid not. Try the potatoes, they're delicious.
TUCKER: Resequenced protein.
PHLOX: Yes. The flavour's remarkable. On my homeworld, people would
never think of speaking during a meal. Considered a waste of time. It's
taken me a while, but I've grown quite attached to it.
TUCKER: Wasting time seems to be all we've been doing. Starting to get
a little antsy.
PHLOX: Antsy?
TUCKER: Restless. We've been on the move for two weeks and haven't seen
a damn thing.
PHLOX: Every moment's been an adventure for me. Humans are so
unpredictable. Have you seen the quantities of food Crewman Namod
consumes?
TUCKER: Not really.
PHLOX: Have you smelled Ensign Socorro after she exercises? She gives
off a fragrance not unlike the adrenal gland of a Nausicaan. And
Crewmen Bennett and Haynem over there. Do you see them? (A man and a
woman sitting at the same table.) PHLOX: If I'm not mistaken, they are
preparing to mate. Do you think they might let me watch?
TUCKER: It's good to see you're enjoying yourself.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Bridge to Captain Archer.
 [Situation room]
 TUCKER: How big is it?
T'POL: Approximately ninety two metres in length.
ARCHER: Doesn't seem to be moving very fast.
T'POL: It's not moving at all.
ARCHER: That's odd. Where's the nearest star system?
T'POL: Almost three light years away.
TUCKER: They could be running some kind of a deep space experiment.
Maybe we should go have a look.
T'POL: If you insist on allowing your curiosity to dictate your
actions.
ARCHER: We insist.
 [Bridge]
 (A long vessel is on the viewscreen.)
TRAVIS: Range, five thousand kilometres.
T'POL: The vessel's hull is comprised of tritanium and disilicon
polymers.
TUCKER: I'm not getting anything on their propulsion system, but it may
be offline. Something, isn't it.
REED: If they have weapons, they're not charged.
ARCHER: Any comm. activity?
HOSHI: No, sir.
ARCHER: Run this through the translation matrix. My name is Jonathan
Archer. I'm Captain of the Starship Enterprise. We're on a mission of
peaceful exploration. Oh, we come from the planet Earth. We're sending
you a pulsar grid that should help you locate our star system. Did you
rotate the frequencies?
HOSHI: I'll try it again. No response, sir.
TUCKER: Captain, mind if I push in on the venting ports around that
hatch?
ARCHER: Go ahead. (He zooms the viewscreen image.)
TRAVIS: Are those venting ports or hull breaches?
ARCHER: Bring us in a little closer, Travis. Let's get a look at the
other side. Those look like scorch marks.
T'POL: The residue indicates oxidation and thermal shock effects. It
could be the result of a high yield particle impact.
ARCHER: You mean weapons.
T'POL: Possibly.
ARCHER: Are we close enough to scan for biosigns?
T'POL: Yes, but scanning their ship's interior might be seen as a
violation of privacy.
ARCHER: Anything? (Hoshi shakes her head.)
TUCKER: If there is anyone home, you can bet they know we're out here.
REED: Then why haven't they responded.
T'POL: Not everyone chooses to answer the door when they hear a knock.
It would be best to resume our previous course.
ARCHER: See if you can find another hatch. Diameter?
TUCKER: Point nine metres.
ARCHER: Scan for biosigns.
T'POL: There are a number of lifeforms aboard.
ARCHER: Humanoid?
T'POL: Their cellular activity is below the threshold of your sensors.
TRAVIS: Maybe they're in trouble. Sick or something.
T'POL: Maybe they're not interested in visitors.
ARCHER: Mister Reed, how long to prep a shuttle?
REED: Half an hour.
T'POL: There are a number of protocols we haven't tried.
ARCHER: Get started.
HOSHI: She may have a point, Captain. I could try hailing them on
theta-band frequencies.
ARCHER: Suit up, Ensign.
HOSHI: Me, sir?
ARCHER: (to T'Pol) The ship is yours.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER: Is there a problem, Commander?
TUCKER: I want to go with you.
ARCHER: I'm bringing a translator and a security officer. Why would I
need an engineer?
TUCKER: What makes you think you can open the hatch, or turn the light
on for that matter.
ARCHER: We've got beacons, Trip.
TUCKER: That ship could have a lot of decks. You might need someone to
help you figure out the turbolifts. Okay, I've got a better reason why
you need an engineer. Because your engineer signed onto this mission of
exploration so he could do a little exploring. He didn't sign on to sit
in Engineering while you three get to break into that ship.
ARCHER: We're not breaking in. We're just going to see if everything's
okay.
TUCKER: You're chomping at the bit to find out what's in there. Why
should I be any different?
ARCHER: We just got out here, Trip. There's going to be plenty of time
to go exploring. Right now I need you on Enterprise, down with your
engine. This ship's a little young to be without her Chief Engineer.
 [Archer's quarters]
 ARCHER: (dictating and eating) When I used to
dream about this mission, the last thing I envisioned was having a
Vulcan on board who continuously sucked the air out of the room. Well,
she's right. Whoever's on that ship might no want us nosing around. But
I can't assume that's the case, can I? Maybe they could use our help.
Computer, pause. (to Porthos) Hey, you know that you and cheddar don't
get along. (gives him a piece anyway) Resume personal log. Before we
left, Admiral Forrest said we'd be making history with every light
year, but we're not going to do that sitting on our hands. Computer
pause. Come in. Ensign.
HOSHI: Sorry to bother you, sir.
ARCHER: It's not a problem. Cheese?
HOSHI: No, thank you.
ARCHER: Everything work out all right?
HOSHI: Sir?
ARCHER: With the swapping quarters.
HOSHI: Yes, that's fine, thank you. I was thinking, Captain, I might be
a lot more helpful to you if I stay here and keep an open comm. link.
That way I'll have immediate access to the linguistic database.
ARCHER: Can't you tie your universal translator into the database
through the comm?
HOSHI: It's not the same. The lag time is tripled.
ARCHER: Well, I'd rather wait a few seconds if it means having you on
site. For all we know, the UT won't work. You'll be our only back-up.
Anyway, it should be exciting. Half the crew would give their eye teeth
to be going over there. What's wrong?
HOSHI: The environmental suits. They make me a little claustrophobic.
ARCHER: Claustrophobic. And you took a job on a spaceship?
HOSHI: You talked me into it, remember.
ARCHER: I don't recall reading about any problems during your zero-g
training.
HOSHI: Well, I just, I bit my lip and got through it.
ARCHER: Well you're just going to have to bite your lip again. I need
you over there.
HOSHI: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: What is it, Hoshi? Is something else wrong?
HOSHI: No, I'd better get back to the Launch Bay.
ARCHER: Hang on, I'll come with you. That's the last time, Porthos.
(He throws the dog some cheese.)
 [Launch bay - suit locker]
 ARCHER: Going to war, Lieutenant?
REED: Can't be too careful, sir.
ARCHER: You've seen too many science fiction movies. We just need the
three phase pistols. Put the rifles back. (to Hoshi) What are you rated
for?
HOSHI: I've been cleared on EM sidearms and class three pulse rifles.
I've never seen one of those.
ARCHER: Malcolm will check you out on it first chance he gets. Don't
worry, it handles pretty much like an EM-33.
HOSHI: Is this necessary?
ARCHER: Just a precaution.
 [Shuttlepod hatchway]
 (The pod has docked with the ship and they are
trying to get inside.)
REED: Just our luck, no release. Shouldn't be a problem though. I can
place micro-charges here and here.
ARCHER: Hold on a second, Malcolm. (He pulls at a couple of protruding
rods, finds one that opens out and opens the hatch.) ARCHER: Sorry.
HOSHI: Enterprise, we've got access. We're boarding the vessel.
 [Alien ship's corridor]
 HOSHI: Well, at least we know they're bipeds.
REED: What gives you that idea?
HOSHI: The ladder.
ARCHER: Come on. Nitrogen-methane atmosphere, and it's cold. Minus
twenty degrees.
HOSHI: There's power going through here, but not much of it.
REED: Captain.
ARCHER: Molecules look like amino acids.
HOSHI: Blood? (Green dribbles are visible on the bulkheads.)
 [Deleted scene]
 (They force open a door. There is still
power to the displays)
HOSHI: These icons look like they represent frequency bands.
REED: Communications.
HOSHI: If it is, it's offline. Maybe that's why they didn't answer our
hails.
REED: (sees blood on bulkhead) They may have been in no condition to
answer our hails.
ARCHER: (at a schematic of the ship) Guys, does any of this make sense
to you? Anything?
REED: Could these be power couplings?
ARCHER: And these could be transfer conduits. Could be a schematic to
their power layout.
REED: Yeah, one diagram for each deck.
HOSHI: And what's this?
REED: That's midship. One deck below. If we're right, something down
there is drawing a lot of power.
ARCHER: Let's go see if we're right.(They go on down to the source of a rhythmic
noise.)
REED: Some sort of hydraulics.
ARCHER: Whatever it is, it hasn't been here very long. (Hoshi screams,
and we see figures hanging upside down with tubes coming from them to
the device.) ARCHER: Hoshi, where are you going?
HOSHI: I don't think you need a translator.
ARCHER: Stay here.
REED: Their bodies are being flushed out with some kind of fluid.
ARCHER: Are they all?
REED: All dead, sir. I'm afraid so.
 [Decon chamber]
 (Phlox and T'Pol at the observation window.)
PHLOX: They're clean.
(The trio are let out and go down a corridor.)
T'POL: How many?
ARCHER: I don't know. About a dozen.
REED: Fifteen.
 [Launch bay - suit locker]
 ARCHER: They're being drained of something.
Whoever did it went to a lot of trouble. My guess is they're coming
back.
T'POL: We should leave.
ARCHER: There are fifteen dead people over there. We can't leave.
T'POL: Your reason for boarding that vessel was to provide assistance,
if assistance was required. Clearly, it no longer is.
ARCHER: You're telling me that we should just leave them there?
T'POL: What's the alternative? Your intentions were admirable, Captain,
but nothing can be done for that crew now and if we remain here your
crew could be put in jeopardy.
ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge.
TRAVIS: Mayweather here, sir.
ARCHER: Go to warp three. Resume course.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: Not long after I became a physician, there
was an explosion on a cargo ship orbiting my homeworld. I was part of
the first medical team to arrive. There were seventeen bodies on the
Bridge alone. I'd never seen that many dead people in one place before.
Very disturbing. You have nothing to be ashamed of.
HOSHI: I screamed like a twelve year old.
PHLOX: We're all frightened by unfamiliar things. You should be
grateful that your body of experience doesn't include rooms full of
corpses.
HOSHI: Nobody else screamed. (re sluggo) Has she been eating?
PHLOX: Not so far. She has been under a great deal of stress, but I'm
hoping this protein concentrate whets her appetite.
HOSHI: I'm a translator. I didn't come out here to see corpses hanging
on hooks.
PHLOX: It goes without saying that you're going to encounter the
unexpected.
HOSHI: Not corpses on hooks.
PHLOX: Have you ever considered that you might be happier back at the
university, teaching? I did it for years. It was quite rewarding.
HOSHI: I'm an exo-linguist. I graduated second in my class. I spent
three years in Starfleet training. I was Jonathan Archer's first choice
for this mission. Every inhabited world we come to is going to be
filled with language. Some will have hundreds of them. He needs me
here.
PHLOX: If she doesn't take these nutrients I'm afraid she won't
survive.
HOSHI: Are you sure that's what she eats?
PHLOX: It's close enough.
HOSHI: I shouldn't have brought her on board. Maybe I could ask the
Captain to try to find a planet with an argon rich atmosphere.
PHLOX: It might be easier just to feed her to my bat.
HOSHI: She needs to get back to an environment that is more suited to
her.
PHLOX: Perhaps some place where she could teach.
 [Captain's mess]
 TUCKER: What kind of pasta is this? It's great. (Archer's mind is elsewhere.)
ARCHER: Chef told me. I don't remember.
TUCKER: Not too spicy for you?
T'POL: It's fine.
TUCKER: Malcolm's anxious to run another weapons test, especially after
what happened. Tea?
T'POL: No, thank you.
TUCKER: Captain?
ARCHER: Sure, thanks.
TUCKER: (pours iced tea) I heard they were humanoid. Is that right?
ARCHER: Humanoid.
TUCKER: Did they look anything like us?
ARCHER: They were in uniform.
TUCKER: But you didn't recognise the species.
ARCHER: They were crewmen, murdered on their own ship. Fifteen dead
crewmen.
T'POL: I detected a stellar nursery along our present course.
TUCKER: I saw one once through the big lens outside Anchorage.
T'POL: A closer view might alleviate some of the crew's tension.
ARCHER: What's the matter, the tension bothering you?
T'POL: Not in the least.
ARCHER: Must be great not to let things bother you. No remorse, no
guilt. What if they were Vulcans? Think you would have reacted the same
way?
T'POL: They weren't Vulcans.
ARCHER: I said, what if they were Vulcans. Would you have just left
them there, hanging like slaughtered animals? Don't you think maybe you
would have taken them down, tried to figure out who they were, made
some effort to contact their families?
T'POL: We don't know where they came from. It would be very difficult
to locate their families.
ARCHER: We didn't even try. (to Tucker) What about you, what if they
were humans? Would you just stick your tail between your legs and run,
leave them there to rot? Am I the only one who's having a problem with
this?
TUCKER: You said it yourself, sir. Whoever killed those people are
probably coming back.
ARCHER: So we should avoid confrontation cost, is that what you're
saying? Is that what you Vulcans do? Bury your heads in the sand and
then just fly on by?
T'POL: We Vulcans would have never gone on board that ship in the first
place.
ARCHER: You got an answer for everything, don't you.
T'POL: We have a code of behaviour, and we try to obey it.
ARCHER: You may not believe this, but humans have a code of behaviour
too. It took a few thousand years, but I think we're starting to get it
right. I can't believe I almost ignored it.
 [Situation room]
 TRAVIS: We've reversed course, sir. We should be
back at the coordinates in five hours.
ARCHER: You don't have a problem with the environmental suit?
PHLOX: Not at all.
ARCHER: Good. We're going to need you to examine the bodies, try to
identify their species. While you're at it, it wouldn't hurt if you can
figure out what's being done to them.
PHLOX: I'll see what I can do, Captain.
ARCHER: (to Tucker) You wanted to see what's going on over there. Now's
your chance. I can't think of a better way to find their people than
through their own comm. system. You're going to need to get it up and
running.
TUCKER: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: Hoshi will decipher their language and compose a message.
Hopefully it'll make sense.
HOSHI: Captain.
ARCHER: I'm sorry, Ensign.
REED: I'll bring a security detail.
ARCHER: There's no one over there who can hurt us. Stay here and work
on those targeting scanners. Prepare to suit up at fourteen hundred
hours. Dismissed.
 [Alien ship - where the bodies are]
 ARCHER: How were they killed?
PHLOX: Different ways. This one was given a lethal dose of chloraxine.
The first three back there were shot. Particle weapons, I believe. This
fellow hasn't suffered as much cellular decay. He's our best candidate
for a post-mortem. Care to assist?
 [Alien ship - the room with power]
(Tucker gets a voice playing back.)  TUCKER: Yeah.
HOSHI: Maybe it's a log. What do you think?
TUCKER: Beats me. Could be a laundry list or instructions on how to
conquer the universe.
HOSHI: The grammar sounds bimodal.
TUCKER: Their transceiver's intact. Let's hope the next time we make
first contact it isn't with a room full of corpses.
HOSHI: Let's hope. (to universal translator) Ship. Ship.
 [Alien ship - where the bodies are]
(The post-mortem is underway.)  PHLOX: Just what I
thought.
ARCHER: What?
PHLOX: A zymuth gland. It releases triglobulin into the blood. That's
what all these tubes and pumps are about. Whoever did this is trying to
collect triglobulin.
ARCHER: What for?
PHLOX: Oh, for any number of reasons. To create medicines, vaccines,
some species have even been known to use it as an aphrodisiac.
ARCHER: Aphrodisiac?
PHLOX: It's quite a common practice. I'm surprised you're not familiar
with it.
ARCHER: Humans used to collect the bile of black bears, grind down
rhino horns, things like that, but not people.
PHLOX: It's worth noting that triglobulin is very similar to human
lymphatic fluid.
 [Alien ship - the room with power]
 HOSHI: How long before the transceiver's online?
TUCKER: A minute or two. I can't get enough of this. An alien spaceship
sending off a message to who knows where.
HOSHI: The quicker we get this done, the quicker we can get back to the
ship.
TUCKER: It's your second away mission in two days.
HOSHI: Yeah, great.
TUCKER: I wish I had an ear for languages. The Captain's going to need
a translator with him a lot more often than an engineer.
HOSHI: Distress. Two other teachers and I once took a hydro-skimmer out
onto a small tributary in the Amazon. You know, to see the wildlife.
Sloths, pink dolphins, all kinds of snakes.
TUCKER: Wow.
HOSHI: It gave me the creeps. If I didn't like being around anacondas,
you can imagine how I feel about Suliban or whoever butchered the crew
of this ship. I'm going to ask the Captain to take me home.
TUCKER: You serious?
HOSHI: I should have never left the university. I'm not suited for
this.
TUCKER: Give it a try. You'll be fine.
HOSHI: You weren't here yesterday. I saw those bodies and fell apart.
The Captain needs a translator he can count on. Someone who shows a
little grace under pressure. That isn't me.
TUCKER: You can't be sure of that.
HOSHI: Oh yes I can. Distress. Distress.
UT: Kunatsila.
HOSHI: I think I've got it. Ship in distress.
UT: Dukdum dor kunatsila. (Tucker transmits the message)
 [Alien ship - where the bodies are]
 T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: There's a vessel approaching, Captain. It's power
signatures match the scans you took of those bio-pumps.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: It appears that whoever killed that crew
has returned.
 [Alien ship - where the bodies are]
 ARCHER: Time to go, Doc. (Archer fires his phase pistol at
the pump.) ARCHER: Trip, Hoshi, docking hatch, now.
(A nasty crab-like ship drops out of warp.)
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Distance, sixty thousand kilometres.
T'POL: Bridge to Armoury.
REED [OC]: Armoury.
T'POL: We have a potentially hostile vessel approaching. Are you
prepared to defend the ship?
 [Armoury]
 REED: That depends. How long till it gets here?
TRAVIS [OC]: Ten minutes, maybe less.
REED: Then the answer is most likely no. The scanners are still out of
alignment. Look, if you wanted me to hit a stationary dairy barn, then
I could accommodate you, but not a moving
 [Bridge]
 REED [OC]: Vessel.
T'POL: Do the best you can, but I need you on the Bridge in five
minutes.
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol. Deploy the docking arm.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Arm extended.
ARCHER [OC]: How close are they?
T'POL: Eight thousand kilometres.
ARCHER [OC]: What kind of weapons?
T'POL: Our sensors can't penetrate their shielding.
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER: Have you tried hailing them?
T'POL [OC]: Yes.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: There's been no response.
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER: Try again. (The pod docks.)
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: The pod's on the arm.
T'POL: T'Pol to Archer. They're still not responding.
REED: They're charging weapons. (Green fire is seen on the viewscreen.) REED: They're
targeting our engines.
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER: We're almost in. Stand by to jump to warp.
(Lots of weapons fire. The pod is jolted off the arm. Hoshi closes the
porthole shutter as they try again. Success.)
ARCHER: Doors.
 [Launch bay]
 (They climb out of the top of the shuttlepod onto
a drop-down metal stairway.)
ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge. It doesn't feel like we've gone to warp.
T'POL [OC]: Our port nacelle has been damaged. (More weapons fire jolts Enterprise.)
ARCHER:  Have Malcolm arm the
torpedoes.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Report.
TRAVIS: We're dead in the water, sir.
T'POL: They seem to have stopped firing. They're closing on our
position.
ARCHER: Malcolm?
REED: Both forward tubes loaded and ready, sir.
ARCHER: Stand by starboard tube.
REED: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: Fire. (The torpedo bounces off the enemy ship.) ARCHER: Stand by port
tube.
REED: Ready.
ARCHER: Fire. (The other ship shoots it down.) ARCHER: Trip, warp status?
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: The nacelle's been completely depolarised.
I'm afraid we're stuck here for a while.
 [Bridge]
 (A vertical beam goes around the Bridge.)
TRAVIS: What was that?
PHLOX: A sub-molecular bio-scan. You've been probed, Ensign. We've all
been probed. They have no doubt discovered that your lymphatic systems
contain some useful compounds.
ARCHER: Get to the Armoury. Start distributing hand weapons. (Reed gets
up to leave) Post security teams at level
TRAVIS: Sir, another vessel just dropped out of warp. (Reed returns to his
station.) TRAVIS: They're on an intercept course.
ARCHER: Let's see it.
HOSHI: They're hailing us.
ARCHER: Put it up. (The viewscreen shows a living member of the alien
species.)
T'POL: Captain?
ARCHER: He's from the same species as the murdered crew. (to Hoshi)
They must have picked up your distress call. Tell him the ship above us
killed the crew of the cargo vessel. They're about to do the same to
us.
HOSHI: I told him what you said, sir, but I doubt it made any sense.
ARCHER: What do you mean?
HOSHI: This isn't exactly Spanish we're dealing with here. I'd be lucky
if I'm getting half the vocabulary right.
(The nasty crab ship puts a beam on them.)
REED: They've locked onto us with some kind of stabilising beam.
ARCHER: Use the impulse engines. Get us the hell out of here.
TRAVIS: I can't, sir. Their beam's disrupting all our propulsion
systems.
(The alien on the viewscreen talks to them.)
HOSHI: It seems he got the part about killing the cargo ship crew but
he believes we did it, sir. At least I think he does.
T'POL: Tell him we sent the distress call. Why would we kill his people
and then do that?
HOSHI: I think I understood this one. He says the distress call came
from his ship, not ours.
ARCHER: We needed their frequencies. Going there was the only way to
find them.
HOSHI: Something about DNA scans. He wants to know why we were there
two years ago.
ARCHER: Two years ago?
HOSHI: He probably means two days, sir. The phonetic processor's still
having trouble locking on. I'm not certain, but I don't think he's
going to help us.
REED: They're fifty metres above us. Forty nine.
ARCHER: The pumps. Tell them to run scans on the bio-pumps that are
hooked up to the corpses. They'll see they're not our technology. Have
them compare the power signatures to the ship that's about to land on
our roof. Where are they, Malcolm?
REED: They've stopped at about ten metres. (The nasty ship prepares to
drill a hole in the hull.)
HOSHI: I'm having trouble with the word pump, sir. I've got the
processor searching for synonyms. The translator's not making a whole
lot of sense to him, sir. He's getting frustrated. I think he's running
out of patience, Captain.
ARCHER: Then forget the translator. Do it yourself.
HOSHI: Do what myself?
ARCHER: Talk to him.
HOSHI: That's impossible, sir. I haven't even learned their basic
conjugations.
T'POL: Talk to him, Hoshi. It doesn't have to be perfect.
HOSHI: You don't understand. I don't even know how to say pump. I'll
get it all wrong, it'll just make things worse.
ARCHER: Things can't get much worse.
HOSHI: Sir.
REED: Captain, they've started drilling into the hull.
ARCHER: Hoshi, Hoshi, I need you to do this. We all do. That's why
you're here. (Hoshi stands in front of the viewscreen, very nervous.)
HOSHI:  Uta doi ura.
(The alien replies.)
ARCHER: Again.
HOSHI: Uta lora ista. Urasta mistavor. (They go into a conversation.)
ARCHER: What'd he say? Ensign. (The iewscreen changes to an image of the small
ship firing on the nasty one.)
REED: They're targeting the vessel above us.
(The beam is shut off and the drill withdrawn.)
TRAVIS: We've got impulse back.
ARCHER: Move us away.
REED: Captain, I may be wrong, but I think I've got the scanners
aligned. Permission to launch a torpedo.
ARCHER: Granted. (One satisfying explosion on the enemy ship then the
good guys finish off the job - KaBOOM!) ARCHER: Nice of them to wait until we
got clear. All stop. (to Hoshi) I think we may have just made a friend,
thanks to you.
 Captain's starlog, May 6th, 2151. After helping
them recover their dead crewmen, we had a chance to spend some time
with the Axanar. Turns out they're androgynous and live over four
hundred years. I look forward to meeting them again under better
circumstances. Before we resume our course, I've agreed to make a brief
detour.
 [Planet surface]
 (Hoshi takes sluggo out of the carry-case, under
Phlox's watchful gaze.)
HOSHI: This isn't exactly like the place you came from, but it's close
enough. It's not that hard to adapt. You're going to do just fine here.
(She puts it down on a rock in a container, and leaves.)

  [Mess
hall]
 ETHAN: How can you eat that stuff? (She is eating soup and reading about termites.)
CUTLER:  It's healthier
than that.
ETHAN: At least this tastes like something.
CUTLER: I guess it just takes a more discriminating palate to
appreciate Vulcan cuisine. Do you know there are over five thousand
subspecies of termites on Loracus Prime?
(A glow comes in through the window, every one gets up and looks at a
beautiful blue planet.)
ETHAN: I thought we were headed for a nebula.
CUTLER: Anybody hear about this?
CREWMAN: Not a word.
CUTLER: I wonder if somebody lives there?
ETHAN: There's a lot of plant life. It might be an oxygen atmosphere.
CUTLER: What do you think, first contact?
CREWMAN: I don't see any cities or agriculture.
ETHAN: Maybe they live underground or in the water.
CUTLER: Is that snow on those mountains?
ETHAN: You'd think the Captain would make an announcement or something.
CUTLER: Well, call him.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: T'Pol.
T'POL: Seventeen percent oxygen, eighty one percent nitrogen.
TUCKER: Sounds like home.
ARCHER: Any people?
T'POL: The planet supports a diverse ecology, but there are no signs of
humanoid life.
ARCHER: Still, someone may have a claim on it. We don't want to go
waltzing into their back yard. Scan for marker buoys, beacons, man-made
satellites.
REED: None in range, sir. Looks like no one's planted a flag just yet.
ARCHER: Prep a shuttlepod, Mister Tucker. (Tucker starts to leave) I
like the looks of the northern continent. See if you can find a good
place to set down.
TRAVIS: Yes, sir.
T'POL: Captain. There are a number of protocols you may want to
consider.
ARCHER: Protocols.
T'POL: Vulcan ships would begin by sending automated probes down to
collect more detailed scans. If the planet proved to be Minshara-class,
we would then conduct a geophysical survey from orbit.
TRAVIS: Minshara-class?
HOSHI: Suitable for humanoid life.
ARCHER: How long would all that take?
T'POL: Six or seven days.
TUCKER: (still at the door) You expect us to sit up here for a week
while probes have all the fun?
T'POL: This planet has been here a long time. It will still be here in
seven days.
ARCHER: I understand that you have a more cautious approach, but we
didn't come out here to tip-toe around. (to Tucker) Get the pod ready.
(Tucker leaves.) ARCHER: I'd like you to put together the survey team. I assume
that's not a violation of protocol?
 [Launch bay]
 CREWMAN: Thanks.
CUTLER: I tried some plomeek broth this morning. It was very good.
Vulcan food is interesting.
T'POL: Did you sterilise the sample containers?
CUTLER: Yes. Thanks for choosing me for this mission.
T'POL: You were selected because your specialty is entomology. This
planet has a diverse insect population. (She turns away.)
CUTLER: (sotto) Great.
TUCKER: You'd have better luck making friends with a housefly.
CUTLER: I know.
 [Shuttlepod]
 (En route to the planet surface.)
TUCKER: Wow.
CUTLER: Worth every light year.
ARCHER: Set us down just east of those hills.
TRAVIS: Aye sir.
 [Planet surface]
 (The pod lands in a meadow, and Porthos is first
out to sniff at a tree.)
TUCKER: Where no dog has gone before.
ARCHER: I almost forgot what fresh air smells like.
T'POL: The atmosphere contains trace elements of nitrogen dioxide,
chloromethane.
ARCHER: Put that thing away. Take a minute to enjoy yourself. The sky
ever get this blue on Vulcan?
T'POL: Occasionally.
ARCHER: We're walking on an alien world light years from Earth or
Vulcan. Doesn't that impress you?
T'POL: I've been to thirty six Minshara class planets. This experience
is only marginally different.
TUCKER: Perfect. Hold it right there. (Tucker gets out his camera to record the
group. Archer nearly puts his arm around T'Pol.)
ARCHER: Smile. Be sure to get a copy
of that to the Vulcan High Command.
T'POL: You have your assignments. We'll rendezvous here at nineteen
hundred hours, unless the Captain wants us to pose for more pictures.
(Cutler examines eel-like fish in a lake. There are two crescent moons
in the sky. Ethan picks a yellow flower in an alpine meadow.)
ARCHER: I'm afraid my log entry isn't going to do this justice.
TUCKER: A cabin in these woods would be nice.
ARCHER: Three weeks in deep space, you're ready to jump ship?
TUCKER: Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. You guys would be lost
without me.
TRAVIS: It's beautiful all right, but I couldn't call a place home
unless it came with a pair of warp nacelles.
TUCKER: Boomers.
(They stop by a stream as Tucker takes yet another photograph, and the
communicator chirps.)
ARCHER: Archer.
T'POL [OC]: Is there a problem, Captain?
ARCHER: No, no problem.
 [Landing site]
 ARCHER [OC]: Why?
T'POL: We were scheduled to rendezvous fifteen minutes ago.
 [By the stream]
 ARCHER: Sorry, we lost track of time. We'll be
right there.
 [Landing site]
 T'POL: We've identified several nocturnal
marsupials. I'd like to keep crewmen Cutler and Novakovich with me
overnight to study them.
ARCHER: I'm glad to see you're getting into the spirit of things. Pick
you up in the morning.
TUCKER: Captain, if it's all right with you, Travis and I'd like to
stay as well.
TRAVIS: We would?
TUCKER: When was the last time you slept under the stars? There's
plenty of camping gear in the pod.
T'POL: This isn't shore leave, this is a research mission.
ARCHER: Why can't it be a little bit of both? Research isn't the only
reason we're out here. Pitch your tent, Commander.
TUCKER: Thanks, Captain. (to T'Pol) Don't worry, we'll keep out of your
hair.
 [Night time - campfire]
 TRAVIS: Keep in mind those cargo vessels weren't
equipped for rescue operations, so the Captain wasn't sure what to do
when he picked up the distress call. But it wasn't a ship that sent the
signal. It was a life-pod from one of the old Y-500-class freighters.
TUCKER: Those were retired decades ago.
TRAVIS: Exactly. The pod had been drifting in space for sixty three
years. Bioscans showed one lifesign inside the pod. Human. The
assistant engineer, George Webb, a friend of my uncle's, was assigned
to open it. Took him over an hour to cut through the hull. He said the
metal felt strange, cold to the touch.
TUCKER: Of course it was cold. It was floating in space for sixty
years.
TRAVIS: He could hear a tapping noise coming from inside, but when he
finally got it open the pod was empty. No body, nothing. A few days
later, Webb started acting strange, getting into fights with the crew,
muttering to himself in some sort of alien language. Then one day he
locked himself in Engineering and overloaded the impulse reactors. He
almost destroyed the ship. Then he sealed himself in a life pod and
ejected it.
CUTLER: I assume the Captain went after him.
TRAVIS: The reactors were too badly damaged. Some people say it was an
alien life form that got into him, others think it was the ghost of a
dead crewman. I never knew what to believe, but Webb is still out
there, drifting. When the subspace noise is real low, some comm.
officers say they can still hear the echo of his distress call. Beep,
Beep. (All laugh.)
T'POL: It's highly doubtful that a distress beacon could function
continuously for sixty three years.
TUCKER: Let me guess. No ghost stories on Vulcan.
CUTLER: (pointing up) That's it, to the left of that trinary cluster.
TUCKER: What?
CUTLER: Our sun.
TRAVIS: Are you sure?
CUTLER: Yeah, positive. Just another speck of light no different than
any other.
TUCKER: When I was a kid I'd go camping with my buddies. We'd spend
half the night looking up at the stars wondering what our own sun would
look like from this far away.
TRAVIS: Now you know.
CUTLER: Are you okay?
ETHAN: Headache. If it's all right with you, I'd like to lie down for a
while before we get back to work.
T'POL: Certainly. (Ethan goes into a tent.)
TUCKER: Has anyone heard the one about the haunted comet?
CUTLER: Wait a minute. You notice something? Fireflies are gone.
TUCKER: Nice going, Travis, you scared off the bugs.
CUTLER: Maybe it's the ghost of George Webb.
(A gust of wind suddenly
blows through the camp.)
TUCKER: Looks like we might have ourselves a little weather.
T'POL: A front is approaching from the south west.
 [Tent one]
 TRAVIS: It must be gusting at eighty kph.
TUCKER: This is nothing compared to a hurricane coming up through the
Florida Keys.
TRAVIS: Try flying through an ion storm at warp two.
 [Tent two]
 ETHAN: Did you hear that?
CUTLER: What?
ETHAN: Someone's out there.
CUTLER: It's the wind.
 [Tent one]
 TUCKER: (leaping up) Ow! Son of a bitch!
TRAVIS: What is it?
TUCKER: There's something in my bag.
(What looks like a Ceti eel from
Wrath of Khan scuttles around.)
TUCKER: Give me your boot.
TRAVIS: What for?
TUCKER: So I can squash it.
TRAVIS: Are we allowed to squash alien life forms?
TUCKER: If they're inside your sleeping bag. (T'Pol is watching from
her tent.) TUCKER: There it is, wait a minute. Where'd you put the phase
pistols?
TRAVIS: You wanna shoot a bug?
TUCKER: I'm just going to stun it.
 [T'Pol's tent]
 T'POL: (using communicator) T'Pol to Tucker.
TUCKER [OC]: Go ahead.
T'POL: Is there a problem, Commander?
 [Tent one]
 TUCKER: Oh no, just an eight inch scorpion thing
inside our tent.
 [T'Pol's tent]
 T'POL: Do you require assistance?
TUCKER [OC]: I think I've got it under control.
 [Tent one]
 TUCKER: No not there, it's over there. (The guy
ropes start to come loose.) TUCKER: T'Pol, you said you found a cave this
afternoon.
 [T'Pol's tent]
 T'POL: Less than half a kilometre from here.
 [Tent one]
 TUCKER: I think we're going to need it.
 [Archer's quarters]
 ARCHER: Come in. (He throws a ball at Reed.) ARCHER: Nice catch.
You'd make a good two metre man. Too bad we don't have a pool on board.
REED: A shame. A wind storm's moving across the northern continent. It
looks like a nasty one.
ARCHER: Survey team?
REED: They've taken shelter, but I'd recommend pulling them out. I've
got a shuttlepod on standby.
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol.
T'POL [OC]: Yes, Captain.
ARCHER: What's your status?
 [Cavern]
 T'POL: We've relocated into a cavern.
ARCHER [OC]: Mister Reed thinks we should come down and get you.
T'POL: A landing under these circumstances might be difficult. We'll be
protected until the winds diminish.
 [Archer's quarters]
 ARCHER: We'll keep an eye on the storm. Let us
know if you need anything.
T'POL [OC]: Understood.
ARCHER: Keep the pod on standby, just in case.
REED: Aye, sir.
 [Cavern]
 TUCKER: (opening case) Who's got the food packs?
CUTLER: Nope.
TUCKER: Travis?
TRAVIS: Not me, sir.
T'POL: We must have left them at the campsite.
TRAVIS: I'll go.
TUCKER: Be careful.
(Ethan peers suspiciously at shadows further into the cavern.)
 [Outside]
 (Travis pounces on a food pack blowing in the
wind, then sees a figure walking in the trees.)
TRAVIS: Trip? Hello?
 [Cavern]
 TRAVIS: Was anybody outside just now?
TUCKER: Just you, why?
TRAVIS: There's someone else out there. (hands over sole food pack)
CUTLER: What?
TRAVIS: Near the campsite.
TUCKER: I think we've had enough ghost stories for one night.
TRAVIS: It's no story.
T'POL: We've scanned the planet, it's uninhabited.
TRAVIS: I'm telling you, I saw three people.
CUTLER: Three? What did they look like?
TRAVIS: It was too dark.
TUCKER: Sub-commander? (She shines her torch on her scanner.)
T'POL: Other than ourselves, there are no humanoid life forms here.
TRAVIS: There could be something wrong with your scanner.
T'POL: It's functioning perfectly. Perhaps you imagined seeing them.
TRAVIS: They looked pretty real to me.
CUTLER: Ethan? (Ethan is very tense and swinging his torch around.)
ETHAN: There's someone back there. I heard voices. Are you going to
tell me I'm imagining things too? It's not safe here.
TUCKER: We don't know that. They could be friendly.
ETHAN: Then why are they hiding? Why don't they come out and say hello?
We should leave.
T'POL: Where do you propose we go, back out into the storm?
ETHAN: It's better than being trapped in here.
TUCKER: Slow down, crewman. That's an order.
(Ethan breaks free and dashes ou.t)
TRAVIS: Ethan!
TUCKER: Stay here. (He opens case and takes out two phase pistols, hands
one to Travis.) TUCKER: Travis. (The pair head out after Ethan. T'Pol takes the third phase pistol.)
T'POL: I'll be back shortly.
CUTLER: Where are you going?
T'POL: If there's someone back there, I intend to find them.
(She heads
deeper into the cavern. Cutler takes the final phase pistol.)
 [Outside]
 TRAVIS: (using scanner) Ethan! (A figure emerges from a rock.)
TUCKER: Travis! I saw one. (But
the rock is as it was.) TUCKER: It came right out of that rock like it was a
part of it.
TRAVIS: That could explain why they're not showing up on our scanners.
(In the cavern, Cutler hears voices and goes deeper into the tunnels to
investigate.
Outside, the men nearly step off a cliff in the dark.)
TUCKER: It's too dangerous. We should go back.
 [Cavern]
 (Cutler follows the voices and sees T'Pol talking
to two aliens who then merge into the rocks.)
CUTLER: Who were they?
T'POL: Excuse me?
CUTLER: Well, who were you talking to?
T'POL: Talking to? There's no one here. (She heads back to main cavern.)
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER [OC]: We've lost Novakovich and we're
apparently not alone. There's some kind of lifeform down here.
ARCHER: Can you make it back to the cavern?
TUCKER: We're heading there now, sir.
 [Cavern]
 TRAVIS: The Captain's on his way. We're getting
out of here.
TUCKER: Not a moment too soon. From what I saw, these things live
inside the rock.
T'POL: I performed a geological analysis. The rocks are composed of
limestone and cormalite, nothing more.
CUTLER: She's lying, Commander. I saw her talking to them.
TUCKER: Crewman?
CUTLER: In there. There were two of them.
T'POL: She's mistaken.
CUTLER: No, I'm not. Why won't you tell us what's going on? What do
they want?
 [Shuttlepod]
 REED: I've got a fix. Twenty kilometres
north east.
ARCHER: Archer to Novakovich. Ethan, respond.
 [Planet surface]
 ETHAN: Who's there? Who is that?
ARCHER [OC]: This is Captain Archer. We're attempting to land. I want
you to get back to the cavern.
ETHAN: Go to hell!
 [Cavern]
 T'POL: I have no reason to deceive you.
TUCKER: Neither does she. You keep claiming these creatures don't
exist, but the rest of us have all seen them. That's a little strange,
don't you think?
T'POL: I can't explain what you've seen, but I assure you I didn't
speak to anyone.
TUCKER: I'd like to believe you, but you Vulcans don't exactly have a
spotless track record when it comes to being honest with us.
T'POL: Your point?
TUCKER: You've held things back before. You might be doing it again.
(comm. chirps) Tucker here.
ARCHER [OC]: We're closing in on your position, Trip. There's a
clearing a hundred metres from the cave entrance. Get to it.
 [Shuttlepod]
 REED: I'm reading them. Two kilometres due west.
ARCHER: I'm taking us down. There's a lot of wind shear near the
surface. Activate the auxiliary landing thrusters. Altitude seventy
metres, forty metres. (The pod is rocking and rolling.)ARCHER: I'll have to try
a different vector.
REED: Starboard.
ARCHER: I see it. (The wing tip grazes a rocky outcrop.)
REED: Thruster four's down. We're leaking plasma coolant.
ARCHER: Almost there.
REED: Sir, we can't safely land in this wind with a thruster out.
 [Clearing]
 (As the pod heads back up into the night sky.)
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Tucker.
TUCKER: Captain, aren't you forgetting something?
ARCHER [OC]: We're going to have to wait
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER: Until the wind dies down. Try to manage
till then.
 [Clearing]
 TUCKER: We'll do our best, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: If you run across
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER: Any more of these aliens, try to make
contact.
 [Clearing]
 ARCHER [OC]: See what you can find out about them.
TUCKER: Understood.
 [Cavern]
(Sitting against the wall.)  TRAVIS: You okay?
CUTLER: Never better.
TUCKER: You heard the Captain. He wants to know about your friends.
What are you going to tell him? What are you going to tell him?
T'POL: This is pointless.
TUCKER: Is it? We're stuck down here for God knows how long with a
bunch of rock people who, for all we know, are staring at us from these
walls right now. Not to mention a crewman out there who probably won't
last the night. Now if we're going to get through this, I need to know
what the hell's going on. You beginning to see my point?
T'POL: I share your concern for crewman Novakovich, but as I told you
TUCKER: You couldn't care less about him or any of the rest of us. That
would require some of those useless human emotions.
T'POL: Your emotions are beginning to affect your judgment. You're
becoming irrational.
TUCKER: You've never seen me irrational.
TRAVIS: Sir. I hate to add to our problems, but we're running low on
water.
TUCKER: Great. We'll have to conserve what's left.
T'POL: That won't be necessary. (She points further into the cavern.) T'POL: I
detected water about sixty metres in that direction.
TUCKER: How do we know you're not going in there to talk to your
friends?
T'POL: Join me if you'd like.
CUTLER: It could be a trap, Commander.
T'POL: I can survive without water for several days. Can you? (Tucker pulls his phase pistol on her.)
TUCKER: Sit down. (He takes her pistol.) TUCKER: You
heard me.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: How's he doing?
HOSHI: Not good. His biosigns are very erratic.
ARCHER: Try him again.
HOSHI: Enterprise to Novakovich.
 [Planet surface]
 HOSHI [OC]: Can you hear me? Ethan. (Ethan is curled
up in a ball, terrified.)
 [Bridge]
 (Ethan's screams come over the comm.)
ARCHER: Mister Reed, can you get a lock on him?
 [Transporter alcove]
 REED: Yes, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: Looks like our only choice.
REED: Understood. Stand by. (He begins beaming Ethan up.) REED: There's a
problem, sir. There are contaminants in the matter stream. The phase
discriminator can't seem to isolate the debris. (Ethan finally
materialises with twigs and leaves stuck on him.) REED: Reed to Sickbay.
Medical emergency.
 [Cavern]
 TUCKER: (pacing) What are you doing?
T'POL: Working.
TUCKER: On what.
T'POL: Scans I took this afternoon.
TUCKER: Find anything you want to tell me about?
T'POL: There's nothing of scientific interest on this planet. Our
mission here was a waste of time.
TUCKER: That's what you'd like us to think. Let me see that thing.
(takes scanner off her)
T'POL: The readings are in Vulcan. You won't understand them.
TUCKER: No, but Hoshi would. This could be evidence.
T'POL: Of what?
TUCKER: Your little conspiracy.
T'POL: I was wrong. There is something of interest here. I've learned a
great deal about human behaviour.
TUCKER: Oh?
T'POL: Under stress, you become volatile. You're a far more dangerous
species than I previously believed.
TUCKER: Your people have been telling us that kind of crap for a
hundred years. Looks like you finally found a way to put us back in our
cage.
TRAVIS: Sir?
TUCKER: Imagine the news back home, Travis. Enterprise crew found dead.
Six weeks into their historic voyage, the bodies of all eighty two
crewmembers were located on an uninhabited world. A Vulcan ship made
the unfortunate discovery. Cause of death remains a mystery. But what
the Vulcans won't say is they know exactly who attacked us. In fact,
they arranged the whole thing. They lured us down here so they could
sabotage our mission.
TRAVIS: You were the one who found these caves, and it was your idea to
stay overnight.
T'POL: I didn't ask you or Mister Tucker to join us.
TUCKER: We know you're here. Why don't you show yourselves? You're not
afraid of us, are you?
T'POL: There's no one there, Commander.
TUCKER: Maybe you're waiting for the others to come down so you can
kill us all at once. Did you see that?
T'POL: All I see is a delusional engineer.
TUCKER: Sounds like you're getting a little volatile yourself,
Sub-Commander. I thought you had your emotions all locked up. Having a
little problem, are you? (Travis sees something slither across the rock roof.)
TRAVIS: Commander! There!
(Tucker fires his phase pistol.)
TUCKER: You think I'm going to wait around here for you to slaughter
us? I'll blow this whole cave apart if I have to. I know you hear me!
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: Human skin is a resilient organ. These
wounds should heal nicely.
ARCHER: Can I talk to him?
PHLOX: Yes, but I doubt he'll make much sense. Have you ever heard of
tropolisine.
ARCHER: No.
PHLOX: It's a psychotropic compound known for its hallucinogenic
effects. This crewman's bloodstream is filled with it.
ARCHER: If it was down on the planet, why didn't our sensors pick it
up?
PHLOX: Normally, it's found in certain flowering plants. Perhaps your
sensors weren't calibrated to detect it.
REED: Or perhaps it wasn't there until that damn wind started.
ARCHER: How long will the effects last?
PHLOX: Now that he's back on Enterprise, he should be alright in three
or four hours.
ARCHER: Will this tro-
PHLOX: Tropolisine.
ARCHER: Will it affect T'Pol as well?
PHLOX: There's no way to know. It might affect her to a lesser degree,
or a greater degree.
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol.
 [Cavern]
 T'POL: Yes, Captain.
ARCHER [OC]: We have Novakovich.
T'POL: And I have a phase pistol pointed at my head.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: What?
TUCKER [OC]: My suspicions were
 [Cavern]
 TUCKER: Right on the nose, Captain. Our little
Vulcan here is
 [Sickbay]
 TUCKER [OC]: Not what she appears to be. Never
was.
ARCHER: What are you talking about?
TUCKER [OC]: There's some kind of
 [Cavern]
 TUCKER: Creatures down here. They hide inside
solid rock. Travis and I have both seen them. Cutler saw two of them
talking to T'Pol. They're up to something but of course, she denies it.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: Listen to me. You've all been exposed to a
psychotropic compound. It causes heightened anxiety
 [Cavern]
 ARCHER [OC]: Hallucinations.
TUCKER: Are you telling me those creatures aren't real?
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: The compound comes from the pollen of a
flower. We think it was blown down from the mountains when the wind
started. The doctor's run tests on Novakovich. He thinks he's going to
be okay in a few hours. So if you can get
 [Cavern]
 ARCHER [OC]: As deep as you can into the caves,
your symptoms should dissipate around the same times.
TUCKER: We didn't imagine this, Captain.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: You dealt with simulations very close to
this in Starfleet training. You're familiar with mind-altering agents.
We'll be down to get you as soon as the winds let up.
TUCKER [OC]: You're not down here, Captain.
 [Cavern]
 TUCKER: You don't understand what's going on.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: Put your weapon down, Trip. That's an
order.
 [Cavern]
 ARCHER [OC]: T'Pol?
T'POL: He's lowered his phase pistol, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: Have you been affected?
T'POL: Yes, but only slightly.
ARCHER [OC]: Try to hold on. Archer out. (Tucker sits down.)
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: Get to the Bridge. I want a weather
report. (Reed leaves)
 [Cavern]
 TUCKER: Travis. (wakes him) You still with me? I
need you on your feet. Those things could come back at any time. Listen
to me. I'm giving you an order. (But Travis is seeing and hearing him
as distorted and weird.) TUCKER: What's wrong? Ensign? (to the ceiling) What'd
you do to him? I can see why you get along so well with them, sneaking
around in the shadows. That's second nature to you Vulcans, isn't it.
T'POL: (in Vulcan)
TUCKER: I have no idea what you just said, but it didn't sound very
nice. You're making a mistake working with her. She'll stab you in the
back first chance she gets. Tell you what. Come out and we'll settle
this peacefully. Whatever she told you about humans, it's not true. You
can see for yourself. Say something! (He fires his phase pistol at the wall just
past T'Pol. She doesn't flinch.) TUCKER: What are you doing her? Yes, sir.
(He starts to wander off down tunnel.) TUCKER: I know, I know, but they're not
giving me much choice. I've got to protect my crew. I understand,
Mister Velik, but I can't do that. (T'Pol goes for the other phase
pistol.) TUCKER: They're trying to kill us. (Tucker sees her with the pistol, and they face
off.) TUCKER: Nice try.
T'POL: (in Vulcan)
 [Situation room]
 REED: The centre of the storm's already passed
over them, but the system spans some five hundred kilometres. We won't
be able to land a shuttlepod before dawn.
ARCHER: When's that?
REED: Nine hours.
PHLOX [OC]: Phlox to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
PHLOX [OC]: Please report to Sickbay immediately. It's urgent.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: I thought you said he was going to be
fine.
PHLOX: I did, but each tropolisine atom contains a stray neutron. When
it started to break down in his bloodstream it released an undetectable
toxin. I've injected him with inoprovalene but I think it may be too
late. If I'd run a submolecular scan I might have anticipated the
complication, but there was no reason to. At least, there didn't seem
to be. I can't tell you how sorry I am, Captain.
ARCHER: What about the others?
PHLOX: They spent less time exposed.
ARCHER: I've got four people down on the surface, Doctor. I need to
know if they're going to be dead when we get there in the morning.
 [Cavern]
 (The stand-off between T'Pol and Tucker continues.)
TUCKER: Stay awake, Travis. I can't afford to have you going out on me.
TRAVIS: I'm trying, sir.
TUCKER: Cutler, you okay? (to T'Pol) If you're waiting for me to pass
out, you're wasting your time. You might as well have your friends come
out now, do whatever they're going to do. (comm. chirps)
T'POL: T'Pol.
ARCHER [OC]: How are you doing?
TUCKER: Who's that?
ARCHER [OC]: It's the Captain, Trip. Are you all right?
T'POL: He's irrational, sir. Mayweather and Cutler are nearly
unconscious.
ARCHER [OC]: Both of you listen to me very carefully. Novakovich may be
dying.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Turns
out the pollen contains some kind of
toxin our sensors hadn't detected. He's responding to medication, but
his odds of recovery would be a hell of a lot better if we'd treated
him sooner. The Doctor and Malcolm are synthesizing ampoules of
inoprovalene. We're going to have to use the transporter to get it to
you, but it's imperative that you inoculate yourselves as soon as
possible. Do you understand what I'm saying?
 [Cavern]
 TUCKER: Taking an injection isn't going to change
a damn thing, don't you see that? They're planning something, Captain.
First us, then all of you.
T'POL: (in Vulcan)
 [Bridge]
 T'POL [OC]: (in Vulcan)
HOSHI: (in Vulcan)
T'POL [OC]: (in Vulcan)
ARCHER: What's going on, Hoshi?
HOSHI: She says Trip's going to kill her, and I don't think she's
imagining it.
 [Cavern]
 TUCKER: Say one more word of that gibberish and
I'm going to split you in two.
ARCHER [OC]: Trip, listen to me.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: The pollen's affecting her too. Think
about it. You've heard of people suffering from dementia who revert to
their native language.
 [Cavern]
 ARCHER [OC]: She can't help it.
TUCKER: The only thing that's affecting her are those rock people. If I
can stop her now, I can save Enterprise.
ARCHER [OC]: Trip, how long have we known each other?
TUCKER: What's that got to do with anything?
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Remember when your EV pack froze up on
Titan during the Omega training mission? You got nitrogen narcosis. You
started to try to take off your helmet. You remember what I'm talking
about?
 [Cavern]
 TUCKER: What's your point!
ARCHER [OC]: I ordered you to keep your helmet on.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: You were delirious, thought you were going
to die, but you obeyed that order because you trusted me.
 [Cavern]
 ARCHER [OC]: I'm asking you to trust me now.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Take the injection, then we'll deal with
these rock people.
 [Cavern]
 (Tucker sees two rock people stand up behind
T'Pol.)
TUCKER: Too late, Captain. I'm not going to die with a hypospray in my
hand.
ARCHER [OC]: Trip!
TUCKER: No! It's not going to happen.
ARCHER [OC]: All right.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Forget the medicine. I think it's time I
explain what's really going on, but just stand by for a minute. I need
Malcolm to target your position.
 [Cavern]
 ARCHER [OC]: Then I'll give you your orders.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Archer to Phlox. The sooner
 [Transporter alcove]
 ARCHER [OC]: The better.
PHLOX: Understood. (Phlox puts the case of hyposprays on the platform.) PHLOX: How close can
you get it?
REED: I think I can safely place it two metres inside the mouth of the
cave.
PHLOX: Good.
 [Cavern]
 TUCKER: Captain? Hello? I'm waiting for that order
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER [OC]: But I can't wait much longer.
ARCHER: All right, Trip. This is a major breach of security, but I'm
going to have to trust you.
TUCKER [OC]: Go ahead.
ARCHER: Starfleet sent us here to make contact with a silicon-based
life form. T'Pol was the only person granted clearance
 [Cavern]
 ARCHER [OC]: To speak with them. Seems they've met
Vulcans before.
TUCKER: Why couldn't you tell me that?
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: When a mission's classified top secret, I
don't ask why.
TUCKER: If it was so top secret, then why'd you let us all come down to
the surface? Let us spend the night?
HOSHI: (whispers) The winds.
ARCHER: We never thought the storm would drive you into the caves.
That's where these rock people live. They didn't want anybody in there
except for T'Pol, so they're not too happy right now. I'm sure you can
understand that.
 [Cavern]
 ARCHER [OC]: They've even threatened to destroy
Enterprise. Now, T'Pol needs to explain to them why you're all there,
but she's not going to have much credibility with you pointing a phase
pistol at her.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: If they agree to listen to her, you'll
need to lower your weapon. If they don't, I'm going to have Malcolm
destroy the cavern. Sacrificing four more crewmen is a small price to
pay to save Enterprise.
TUCKER [OC]: I understand.
ARCHER: Now, I'm going to ask Hoshi to tell T'Pol everything I just
told you in Vulcan.
 [Cavern]
 ARCHER [OC]: You got a problem with that?
TUCKER: (sweating and shaking) Go ahead.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Ensign.
HOSHI: (in Vulcan) T'Pol replies in Vulcan, whilst beginning to sweat herself.)HOSHI: She says play-acting isn't exactly a Vulcan
tradition, but she'll do her best.(T'Pol calls out in Vulcan to the surrounding
rock walls, then reports to Enterprise.)ARCHER: Hope she knows the difference between stun
and kill. (He opens a comm. channel.)ARCHER: They've agreed to talk to her, Trip, so
lower your weapon
 [Cavern]
 ARCHER [OC]: And act real friendly.
(Tucker begins to lower the phase pistol, and looks around, then T'Pol
fires at him and he falls. She goes to the mouth of the cave to collect
the hyposprays and injects Tucker and Cutler. Travis resists)
TRAVIS: No. (So she neck-pinches him and injects him anyway, before
finally injecting herself. The sun has risen by the time Tucker wakes
up and accepts a drink of water from her.)
TUCKER: You didn't shoot me last night, did you?
T'POL: I'm afraid I did.
TRAVIS: I was hoping it was all just a bad dream.
TUCKER: Are they gone?
T'POL: They were never here.
CUTLER: What?
T'POL: There were no rock people. You were all hallucinating.
TUCKER: The pollen?
T'POL: Yes.
TUCKER: Then what about that speech you gave to the wall?
T'POL: The Captain felt that if I played along, it might help to
persuade you to lower your weapon. You'd grown increasingly illogical
and violent. Something about splitting me in two.
TUCKER: A pretty good performance. Look, I know I kind of shot my mouth
off last night.
T'POL: You were under the influence of the pollen. We all were.
TUCKER: Challenge you preconceptions or they'll challenge you.
T'POL: Commander?
TUCKER: That's something Mister Velik used to say. Tenth grade biology
class. He was a Vulcan scientist (who came to teach us about life on
other worlds. I'd never seen a Vulcan before, not up close. He scared
the hell out of me.
T'POL: Perhaps it's not too late to follow his advice.
TRAVIS: Ow, I must have twisted up my neck. How's Novakovich? Do we
know?
T'POL: The Captain says he's going to be fine.
(Cutler goes to the cave mouth to see a pod coming in to land.)

Original Airdate: 17 Oct, 2001
  [Archer's
quarters]
 (Archer is taking a shower when there's a noise.
His feet gently lift off the floor and the water floats out in all
directions.)
ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge.
REED [OC]: Lieutenant Reed, sir.
ARCHER: What the hell's going on?
 [Bridge]
 REED: We are having a little trouble with the
gravity plating on E deck. I hope it hasn't caused you
 [Archer's quarters]
 REED [OC]: Any inconvenience. (Archer is hanging onto the showerhead.)
ARCHER: Oh, no, no, no, not at all. Any
idea when you might get it back online?
 [Bridge]
 REED: Commander Tucker says it should be any
minute now, sir.
 [Archer's quarters]
 (Man and water come crashing to the floor.)
ARCHER: Thank you.
 [Mess hall]
 (T'Pol helps herself to a bowl of liquid from the
buffet table.)
PHLOX: Not a very adventurous breakfast.
T'POL: Plomeek broth is a traditional morning meal on Vulcan.
PHLOX: Ah, but you're not on Vulcan. You should try these blueberry
pancakes. They're quite delicious.
T'POL: I sampled human food on several occasions. It didn't agree with
me.
PHLOX: Give it some time. The Vulcan digestive tract is highly
adaptable.
T'POL: I prefer to eat the foods I'm accustomed to.
PHLOX: There's an old saying. When in Fellebis, do as the Fellebians
do.
T'POL: It's difficult enough having to smell all this. Eating it is out
of the question. (She goes to the drinks dispenser.) T'POL: Water, carbonated.
PHLOX: Now that's adventurous. (But it comes out as thick black gloop.)
 [Engineering]
 DILLARD?: We're getting reports from C deck that
it's down to twelve degrees. Ensign Almack is working on it.
TUCKER: Well, tell him to hurry up. If the relays up there get too
cold, they're going to start cutting out on us. (comm. chirp)
Engineering.
CREWMAN [OC]: We've got a power fluctuation in the starboard nacelle,
sir.
TUCKER: We'll get to it as soon as we can.
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye. sir.
ARCHER: Any luck?
TUCKER: We know it's got something to do with the plasma exhaust. The
flow's been restricted for some reason and it's screwing up half the
systems on the ship. (to Dillard) Tell Billy to purge the aft manifold.
DILLARD: Sir.
ARCHER: You think it might be a good idea to drop out of warp?
TUCKER: Give me a minute, sir. I think we can figure it out. (There is and explosion
next to Archer. He grabs an extinguisher and helps put the fire out.) TUCKER: Tucker to Bridge. Might be a good idea to drop out of warp.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Going to impulse, sir.
T'POL: Commander, I think I've found the problem.
 [Bridge, rear]
 T'POL: Something's distorting our wake pattern.
TUCKER: You're right. The plasma exhaust shouldn't be flaring that
close to the ship.
REED: EM residue in the exhaust ports?
TUCKER: No, we checked. They're clean.
ARCHER: Malcolm, if we ignited the plasma exhaust, what kind of damage
would it do to the nacelles?
REED: Sir?
ARCHER: How much damage?
REED: If we polarize the hull plating, it should be all right as long
as we maintained at least half impulse.
ARCHER: Go to half impulse, Ensign.
(All move to the front of the bridge.)
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: (to Hoshi) Put up A4. (A view from the aft of the saucer section on the viewscreen.)
ARCHER: Record all aft sensors.
T'POL: Hull plating.
REED: Both nacelles are at maximum.
T'POL: Stand by to ignite a charge at eighty metres due aft.
ARCHER: Fire. Play it back, slowly. Go back and freeze it at the
flashpoint. Creep it forward a little. There.(A ship is silhouetted
against the bright light.)
TUCKER: Looks like we've got ourselves a hitchhiker.
T'POL: They must be using some sort of stealth technology.
HOSHI: I wonder how long they've been there.
ARCHER: Long enough to throw half our systems out of whack. I'm sure
they know we've detected them. Open hailing frequencies.
HOSHI: Our ship-to-ship sensors are malfunctioning. I can only give you
audio. Translator's active.
ARCHER: This is Captain Jonathan Archer of the Starship Enterprise. I
don't need to tell you where we are. Your presence is disrupting a
number of our systems. Please back away to a distance of at least ten
kilometres and respond.
TRENA'L [OC]: (unknown language) harm us. (unknown) your request. We
ask you not to harm us. We are complying with your request. We ask you
not to harm us.
REED: They're moving off, sir.
ARCHER: We have no intention of harming you, but I wouldn't mind an
explanation.
TRENA'L [OC]: I apologise for any damage we've caused. Our engines are
malfunctioning and we've been using your plasma exhaust to replenish
our teraphasic coils. It's allowed us to share your warp field.
T'POL: Their warp reactor is offline.
ARCHER: We can't help you unless we can see you, so why don't you
disconnect whatever stealth device you're using. (The ship appears aft
of Enterprise.)
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: I'm giving you forty milligrams of
mirazine. (injects Tucker) It should shorted the decompression process
by half.
TUCKER: That still leaves three hours. Can you recommend a good book?
T'POL: I'll be briefing you on their propulsion systems.
TUCKER: Sure you don't want me coming back at night?
ARCHER: Three hours of decompression in each direction, makes more
sense to stay until the job's done.
PHLOX: I've sent them your dietary requirements.
T'POL: They claim to have the ability to synthesize protein and
carbohydrates, but there's no telling what it may taste like. Try to be
diplomatic.
TUCKER: Three days on an alien ship. (Phlox gives another injection)
ARCHER: Remember to mind your manners.
 [Shuttlepod]
 (It docks with ship.)
TRAVIS: We've got a seal.
TUCKER: (packing case) Just about ready.
TRAVIS: It's too bad the ship-to-ship sensors are down. Would have been
nice to get a look at them.
TUCKER: I'll just think of it as a blind date. Tucker to Enterprise.
ARCHER [OC]: Archer.
TUCKER: Here I go, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: Keep your comm. channel open. We'll be right here.
TRAVIS: (handing up case as Tucker climbs into the tube between the
airlocks) Here you go.
TUCKER: Don't forget to come back for me.
TRAVIS: I don't know. We are kind of busy. Have fun.
(The shuttlepod undocks, leaving the slightly organic looking ship.)
 [Decompression chamber]
 TUCKER: Hello?(Gas pours in.) TUCKER: Hello?
AH'LEN [OC]: Try to maintain your normal rate of respiration.
TUCKER: (coughing) This stuff's burning my lungs.
AH'LEN [OC]: Maintain your normal rate of respiration. The discomfort
will subside.
 [Ready room]
 T'POL [OC]: Commander Tucker's calling again, sir.
He's rather anxious.
ARCHER: Put him through.
TUCKER [OC]: How long's it been, sir?
ARCHER: About five minutes longer than the last time you asked.
 [Decompression chamber]
 ARCHER [OC]: How's the breathing?
TUCKER: A lot easier, but I prefer air I can't see.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: They told us the air would clear up during
the last half hour of decompression.
 [Decompression chamber]
 TUCKER: I feel like I've been in here for a week.
ARCHER [OC]: You've only got forty five minutes to go, Trip.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Be patient. (To Porthos, who sits up and
begs.) ARCHER: Hey. Good boy. There you go. (Archer puts down Porthos' food bowl.)
 [Decompression chamber]
(Tucker is calling flashing lights off a display.) TUCKER:
Blue one. Green three. Yellow two. Orange five. Yellow three. Red four.
Green two. Whoa, whoa, that's too fast. I'm not a computer.
(The door behind him opens and he steps out into.)
 [Xyrillian ship]
 (Xyrillians are reptile-like, scaly, wearing shiny
one-piece suits.)
TRENA'L: I hope the acclamation process wasn't too stressful.
TUCKER: Blue three, yellow six, orange four. (He's slightly woosy and
the sound is slightly slow.)
TRENA'L: The perceptual tests are the best way to determine whether
you're ready for our environment.
AH'LEN: We've prepared a meal for you.
TUCKER: Not right now, thank you.
TRENA'L: We strongly recommend that you get some rest.
TUCKER: I think I'd like to take a look at that engine room of yours.
AH'LEN: It's one deck above us.(She leads the way past windows showing
eels swimming.)
 [Xyrillian Engineering]
 (They are lying underneath lots of coils and
tubing with changing light colours.)
AH'LEN: These are the teraphasic coils. The wider ones have lost their
cohesion.
TUCKER: I'm sorry, you lost me. I'm having trouble concentrating with
all this noise and light.
AH'LEN: Are you certain you don't want to rest for a while?
TUCKER: I don't know what I'm certain about.
 [Archer's quarters]
 T'POL [OC]: Mister Tucker again, sir.
ARCHER: Put him through. Yeah, Trip. How's it going?
TUCKER [OC]: Not good. I don't think I'm going to be much help over
here. I'm having a little more trouble adjusting than I thought I
would.
ARCHER: What's the problem?
 [Xyrillian Engineering]
 TUCKER: I feel like I've got a fever. I'm having
trouble focusing, breathing. I really think I need to get back,
Captain.
 [Archer's quarters]
 ARCHER: Stand by for a minute. T'Pol, put me
through to Trena'l.
T'POL [OC]: Stand by.
TRENA'L [OC]: Captain Archer?
ARCHER: My man's not doing so well over there.
TRENA'L [OC]: He'll be fine.
ARCHER: With all due respect, I've known Commander Tucker for eight
years. He's tough as nails. If he says he's having problems, I've got to
believe him.
TRENA'L [OC]: When he came out of decompression he refused to rest. I
strongly suggest he'd lie down for a while.
ARCHER: You really think that'll make a difference?
TRENA'L [OC]: We have a good deal of experience with alien visitors.
 [Xyrillian Engineering]
 ARCHER [OC]: I told Trena'l you'd try to get at
least an hour of shut-eye. He says that should do the trick.
TUCKER: I just want out, sir. I'm not kidding. I can't take much more
of this.
ARCHER [OC]: Trena'l says they've dealt with this before. Just one
hour. If you're not feeling better, we'll bring you back.
TUCKER: It's not going to work, Captain.
 [Archer's quarters]
 ARCHER: Take a nap, Trip. That's an order.
 [Xyrillian Engineering]
 ARCHER [OC]: Archer out.
AH'LEN: We've prepared sleeping quarters for you. It's not far.
 [Trip's temporary quarters]
 (The 'bed' is a curve cut out of a red block -
think solid hammock. The walls have moss and there is a sound of
waves. The sound and light distortions of the previous scenes are gone.)
AH'LEN: Your Captain sent the recording . He thought it might help you
relax. Are you feeling better?
TUCKER: What's that?
AH'LEN: Our food. It grows all over the ship. Would you like some? It's
very sweet.
TUCKER: I think I'll pass.
AH'LEN: This is the closest we could come to water. (She picks up a large
bowl of what looks like ice cubes and goes to put one in his mouth.)
AH'LEN: Trust me. (When her fingers touch his lips there's a sort of electric
frizz.) AH'LEN: Did that hurt?
TUCKER: Not really. (she does it again) It's kind of nice. Does that
happen when you people touch each other?
AH'LEN: Something similar. Have you had enough?
TUCKER: A man needs a lot of fluids when he's under the weather. (She
continues to feed him water, slowly, letting her fingers linger on his
lips. She finally breaks eye contact.)
AH'LEN: If you're feeling well enough,
we really should get back to the repairs.
TUCKER: Could we take some of those with us?
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Are the injector cells aligned with the
primary coil?
TUCKER [OC]: Aligned and locked. You're not going to believe this.
They've got grass growing on the floor. Real grass. It's even green. Is
Vulcan grass green?
T'POL: Have you tested the ion matrix, Commander?
TUCKER [OC]: The grass releases some kind of vapour, helps them
metabolize their food. Smells just like a freshly mowed lawn.
T'POL: The ion matrix, Commander.
 [Alien Engineering]
 TUCKER: Oh, right. I've recharged the assembly. Is
it up to point four yet?
ALIEN: Point four three.
TUCKER: Keep pumping up the gradient. If we can get it up to point five
the coils should come back online
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER [OC]: All by themselves.
ARCHER: Sounds like Trip's feeling better.
TRAVIS: Before you know it, he'll have that engine room running like a
well-oiled machine.
TUCKER [OC]: Tucker to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead, Trip.
 [Xyrillian Engineering]
 TUCKER: We're nearly ready to bring the warp
reactor online. Shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.
ARCHER [OC]: Just think, yesterday you would have done anything to get
out of there.
TUCKER: Tucker out.
AH'LEN: It will take a while for the coils to regenerate. Come with me.
There's something I want you to see.
 [Xyrillian Holodeck]
 (The walls are speckled with the colours of the
rainbow. Ah'len takes a control from a panel.)
AH'LEN: Watch this. (She presses a couple of buttons and the room changes
to an alien planet landscape - it's a holodeck!) AH'LEN: That's Thera. It's
where I come from.
TUCKER: The depth perception is incredible. What is it, a 3-D simulator
of some kind?
AH'LEN: It's holographic.
TUCKER: Not like any hologram I've ever seen. (Ah'Len pours sand into his hand.)
AH'LEN: It seems real, doesn't it.
TUCKER: How do you?
AH'LEN: Resequenced photons. Come with me. (They walk)
TUCKER: The perspective's changing.
AH'LEN: We could walk all the way to the city and you'd never know
we're still in this room.
(She changes it to a seascape, with them standing in a small boat.) AH'LEN: Sit
down.
TUCKER: We're still in the same room and this isn't a boat.
AH'LEN: It's a boat. It's just resequenced
TUCKER: Resequenced photons.
AH'LEN: Exactly.
TUCKER: If we had one of these on Enterprise, I'd never ask for shore
leave.
AH'LEN: you don't have any dermal plating. How do you detect other
people's moods?
TUCKER: We don't. Well, actually we do, but we do it through observing
behaviour, getting to know someone.
AH'LEN: The follicles on your face. If I'm not mistaken, they've grown.
Do they have a purpose? (Tucker rubs his chin.)
TUCKER: Not that I know of. Normally we shave them off
with something called a razor, but I haven't had the chance since I've
been here.
AH'LEN: Do you mind?
TUCKER: Go ahead.(She strokes his cheek and that electric thing
happens again.) AH'LEN: Does that hurt?
TUCKER: (grinning) Not in the least. (She uses the holodeck control to
call up a square urn with clear granules in it.) TUCKER: More water?
AH'LEN: No, this is a game we play. Watch. (She puts her hand into it
and it glows slightly.) AH'LEN: Go ahead.
TUCKER: Are there any rules to this game? (His hand is glowing too.)
AH'LEN: It takes four hands to work. (The glow spreads up their arms.) AH'LEN: Your favourite food is catfish.
TUCKER: How the hell did you know that?
AH'LEN: What's mine.
TUCKER: Your what, favourite food?
AH'LEN: Yes. Concentrate. What's my favourite food.
TUCKER: Dutara root. How'd I know that?
AH'LEN: I wasn't certain the granules would work with your species.
Captain Archer saved your life once, about four years ago.
TUCKER: This is one hell of a game. You find me attractive.
AH'LEN: You like having people find you attractive, don't you?
TUCKER: Sometimes.
ALIEN [OC]: Reactor room to Ah'len. The coils are coming back online.
AH'LEN: Understood. You'd better stand up. (She turns off the holodeck.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 TRAVIS: Decompression any easier coming back?
TUCKER: Three hours is three hours. You can't imagine what it was like
over there, Travis. Food growing on the walls, teraphasic warp coils,
boxes full of pebbles that make you telepathic.
TRAVIS: What were the Xyrillians like?
TUCKER: A little shorter than us, weird scales on their faces, but
otherwise pretty much like you and me. It sure was something. Reminded
me why I signed on. But it is good to be home.
 [Bridge]
 TRENA'L [on viewscreen]: I hope your mission
hasn't been overly delayed.
ARCHER: Getting a chance to meet other species is our mission.
TUCKER: I see you've got the visual back online.
ARCHER: Hoshi. Trena'l wanted to thank you again.
TRENA'L: [on viewscreen]: I realise how difficult it must have been,
adapting to our environment.
TUCKER: It was worth every minute. As long as those coils stay charged,
you shouldn't have a problem maintaining a stable warp field. (to
Ah'len) Thanks for taking care of me when I wasn't feeling so hot.
AH'LEN [on viewscreen]: It was worth every minute. Good luck to you.(Their ship warps away.)
ARCHER: Nice work, Commander.
TUCKER: I appreciate the opportunity, Commander.
T'POL: I for one won't miss the malfunctions their proximity was
causing.
ARCHER: Return to our previous heading, Travis.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
 [Mess hall]
 REED: Didn't they feed you over there? (Tucker is eating like he's starving.)
TUCKER: You should've come with me,
Malcolm.
REED: I heard about the holographic recreation.
TUCKER: It wasn't like any visual simulator I've ever tried. It was
more like actually being there. You could smell the ocean, feel the
salt air on your skin.
REED: If we had one of those on board, I can only imagine what it would
be used for.
TUCKER: I don't know if they can recreate people with it, but it sure
did a hell of a job on landscapes.
REED: Make any friends?
TUCKER: Ah'len, one of their engineers. She's the one who showed me the
holographic chamber.
REED: Is she the one you thanked for taking care of you?
TUCKER: Yeah.
REED: Interesting scales.
TUCKER: She did have a certain sensuality to her.
REED: So, did you get a look at their weapons?
TUCKER: I don't even know if they had any. Have you tried these
scrambled eggs? Tastes just like the real thing today.(He notices strange
red mark on his wrist.)
REED: Maybe you were allergic to something over there.
TUCKER: Well, I cleared bioscan.
REED: Nevertheless, you'd better have Doctor Phlox take a look at it.
 [Sickbay]
 TUCKER: As far as I know, I've never been allergic
to anything.
PHLOX: I don't believe you're having an allergic reaction. Tell me, did
your visit to the Xyrillian ship involve any romance?
TUCKER: What?
PHLOX: Were you intimate with anyone?
TUCKER: Doc, I was over there to repair a warp reactor. What are you
talking about?
PHLOX: It seems you did a little more than repair work. (Phlox holds the scanner
up to Trip's chest.)
TUCKER: Meaning?
PHLOX: This is a nipple. (The mark on Trip's wrist.)
TUCKER: I beg your pardon?
PHLOX: Ah, the blastocyst is located between the sixth and seventh
intercostals.
TUCKER: What the hell are you talking about?
PHLOX: I'm not quite sure if congratulations are in order, Commander,
but you're pregnant.(Later, as Tucker is wheeled out of the body
scanner.)
PHLOX: Here, do you see that cell cluster? That
is the embryo. I assume you'll be happy to know that it's
not technically your child.
TUCKER: What do you mean?
PHLOX: When reproducing, the Xyrillians only utilize the genetic
material of the mother. The males simply serve as hosts.
TUCKER: That's comforting, but how the hell did I get knocked up?
PHLOX: We don't have any data on their mating procedures, but I
wouldn't think it would be that difficult for you to recollect a sexual
encounter.
T'POL: Three days. You were only there for three days and you couldn't
restrain yourself.
TUCKER: I'm telling you, Captain, I was a complete gentleman the entire
time.
T'POL: I imagine that's a question of how you would define gentleman.
TUCKER: The only female I had any contact with was Ah'len, their
engineer. Other than repairing the reactor, all she and I did together
was go into that holographic chamber they've got. She showed me some
home movies, simulations of their planet, but I didn't lay a hand on
her. There's got to be some way to get this thing out of me without
hurting it. Can't you create a surrogate chamber or something?
PHLOX: The embryo has integrated with your pericardium. I wouldn't be
comfortable extracting it without more information on the gestation
process.
T'POL: This engineer wanted you to see her planet?
TUCKER: So?
T'POL: Perhaps the next step would have been to meet her holographic
parents. If I'm not mistaken, on some planets that's a precursor to
marriage.
TUCKER: We took a ride in a row boat. I swear, Captain, nothing
happened.
PHLOX: There had to be a somewhat lengthy physical contact to transfer
this much genetic material.
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: I've been in Starfleet for twelve years. Do you think I'd
jeopardise my career by messing around with some alien engineer on a
three day mission? I considered myself a diplomat from the minute I set
foot in that vessel. Well, there was that box of pebbles.
ARCHER: Pebbles?
TUCKER: Yeah, she had it on the boat. But it was no bid deal. We just
stuck our hands into these granules for a few minutes. It's a game they
play, let's you read each other's minds. They weren't even real, they
were holographic just like everything else in the room.
ARCHER: Doctor?
PHLOX: Without a sample of these telepathic granules it would be
impossible to make a determination, but they could have served as the
transferral medium.
T'POL: One of the first things a diplomat learns is not to stick his
fingers where they don't belong.
TUCKER: Captain?
ARCHER: If we're going to safely remove this life form from Commander
Tucker, we'll have to find the Xyrillians. (to T'Pol) Why don't you and
Malcolm see what you can do about locating their ship.
T'POL: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: Is Trip well enough to return to his duties?
TUCKER: What, are you kidding? I'm fine.
PHLOX: You'll probably feel a bit nauseated in the mornings, so get
sufficient rest and exercise and see me at least once a day. That
nipple may not be the only surprise your body has in store for you.
TUCKER: You think we could keep this between the four of us, at least
for the time being?
ARCHER: You got it.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Dillard.
DILLARD: Sir?
TUCKER: Look at this lift.
DILLARD: Sir?
TUCKER: It's an accident waiting to happen. This safety bar's a metre
off the floor. What use would it be for a small person?
DILLARD: A small person?
TUCKER: A short alien, a child. This thing's a deathtrap. (He lifts the
two rails and steps onto the platform.) TUCKER: Look at this handrail. Put your
hands here while this is going up or down, it'll take your fingers
right off.
DILLARD: Why would someone put their hands there, sir?
TUCKER: Never mind.
 [deleted scene - Bridge, rear]
 TUCKER: Are you certain you made the
correct sensor modifications?
REED: Yes, absolutely certain. Their last trajectory?
T'POL: We've altered our course to match.
TUCKER: How do we know they haven't changed their heading?
T'POL: We don't, but we've compensated to detect their stealth
telemetry. We should be able to locate them.
REED: It may take a while. Why exactly are we trying to find that ship?
T'POL: Yes. I thought you provided all the services they required.
TUCKER: If you'll excuse me, I'm not feeling very well.
T'POL: Perhaps a little lunch might help. I hear Chef has prepared
Rigelian sausage. (Tucker groans) Being vegetarian I can't speak from
experience, but I'm told it's quite succulent.
TUCKER: I think I'm just going to go lie down for a while.
REED: Commander, if we tune the UV sensors to the omicron band, we
should be able to isolate their plasma trail a good deal faster. Do you
think you could spare a minute just to help me recalibrate them?
TUCKER: I'm afraid this isn't a very good time. (makes a dash for
another door, hand over mouth, noises of being sick out of camera shot)
 Captain's starlog, supplemental. We've spent eight
days looking for the Xyrillian ship, but so far we've had no luck.
 [Captain's mess]
 (Tucker enters the mess hall wearing a casual shirt and looks
around at the crew laughing as if at him, then goes through another
door.) TUCKER: Sorry I'm late.
ARCHER: No problem. How you feeling?
TUCKER: I thought we all promised to keep this under wraps.
ARCHER: I haven't said a thing. Doctor?
PHLOX: Not a word.
TUCKER: I knew it. She probably let it slip the minute she left
Sickbay.
PHLOX: But Sub-Commander T'Pol promised to keep your pregnancy a secret.
TUCKER: Where I'm from, Vulcans aren't known for keeping promises.
ARCHER: Well, what makes you think she's told anyone?
TUCKER: All you have to do is see the way they whisper, talk behind my
back. You know what happened this morning? Ensign Hart pulled my chair
out for me. I'm telling you, it was T'Pol and you can be sure it was
intentional. What's that?
ARCHER: Chicken tetrazzini. (Tucker takes the remains of the dish.) ARCHER: Did
you cut yourself?
TUCKER: I wish. I don't want to ruin you appetites, but take a look at
this. (He peels back the plaster from the nipple on his wrist. There's a
second one starting up.) TUCKER: Just how many of these am I going to grow? And
while we're on the subject, are they going to go away again afterward?
PHLOX: One would think. Then again, I have no experience with this
species.
TUCKER: (putting the plaster back) Great.
ARCHER: You know, it's been over a week, Trip. We have to start
considering the possibility that we're not going to find the
Xyrillians.
TUCKER: What's that supposed to mean? Are you saying I'm going to
deliver this baby?
PHLOX: I believe he's saying a good deal more than that. Once the child
is born, it may well rely on you in some way to care for it.
TUCKER: I'm the Chief Engineer. I spent years earning that position. I
never had any intention of becoming a working mother.
ARCHER: You know, the Doctor was saying that the gestation period will
only last another five weeks, six at the most.
PHLOX: You should expect to begin experiencing some unusual symptoms.
Hormonal changes mostly, mood swings, heightened emotions.
ARCHER: I suggest you stick with the civilian clothes. Seems to help
hide the bulge.
TUCKER: How much bigger is this thing going to get? I'm already the
laughing stock of the ship. (He summons the galley assistant.) TUCKER: I'd love
some more of this.
CREWMAN: Yes, sir. (The crewman leaves.)
ARCHER: I'd like you to start seeing the Doctor every eight hours. As
your delivery date gets closer, he should be able to start figuring out
what your postnatal responsibilities might be.
TUCKER: Postnatal responsibilities?
PHLOX: You may very well be putting those nipples to work before you
know it.
(The crewman has reentered with a fresh tray of chicken tetrazzini. Tucker
takes it off him and glares. The crewman leaves quickly.)
ARCHER: There's a bright side to all of this.
TUCKER: Yeah? What's that.
ARCHER: As far as we know, this is the first inter-species pregnancy
involving a human.
 [Bridge]
 REED: Got something.
TRAVIS: Looks like their signature.
T'POL: Coordinates oh seven eight mark six, three million kilometres.
Change our heading to intercept. Bridge to Archer.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
T'POL: We may have found the Xyrillian ship, sir.
 [Captain's mess]
 TUCKER: (to the ceiling) Thank you.
ARCHER: On our way.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: What have you got?
T'POL: We're approaching the coordinates. I've analysed the stealth
telemetry, I believe it's them.
ARCHER: Drop down to impulse. Hoshi, try to get an image. (A ship comes
up on the viewscreen.)
TUCKER: Doesn't look very stealthy to me.
ARCHER: Go tighter. (TOS fans will recognise it instantly.)
REED: If the starship profiles the Vulcans gave us are correct
T'POL: They're correct, Lieutenant. That's a Klingon battle cruiser.
TUCKER: Where the hell are the Xyrillians?
T'POL: It appears your repairs didn't last very long. If I'm correct,
they're hiding in the Klingon's plasma wake.
ARCHER: Hoshi?
HOSHI: The translation programme should be in pretty good shape, sir.
REED: Sir, with all due respect, do we really think this is a wise
idea?
ARCHER: If we're going to speak to the Xyrillians, we can't do it
without the Klingons knowing about it. Open a channel. This is Captain
Archer of the starship Enterprise. We respectfully would like to ask
for your assistance with a little problem we're having.
REED: Sir, they're charging weapons.
ARCHER: Polarize the hull plating. (A torpedo heads their way.) ARCHER: Grab
hold of something. (Whumph!)
REED: And another one.
TUCKER: Why are they attacking us?
T'POL: They're not. If they wanted to destroy Enterprise they would
have done it.
ARCHER: So I guess that's their version of a warning shot across our
bows.
REED: I don't recommend being the recipient of another warning like
that, sir.
TRAVIS: Should I lay in a new course, Captain?
ARCHER: No, stay where you are. Hail them again.
TUCKER: Sir, look at their starboard nacelle. The power's fluctuating
just like ours did when the Xyrillians were riding in our wake.
HOSHI: They're responding.
VOROK [on viewscreen]: What gives you the right to approach a Klingon
warship?
ARCHER: Please accept our apology, but I need to ask you a question.
VOROK [on viewscreen]: And what would that be?
ARCHER: Have you been experiencing any unusual malfunctions? Problems
with your gravity plating, propulsion, environmental controls?
VOROK [on viewscreen]: You've been monitoring our systems. For how
long?
ARCHER: We haven't, I promise you. The same things happened to us a few
days ago. Your problems are being caused by a small stealth vessel
that's been riding in your wake. They're using your plasma exhaust to
fuel their warp coils.
VOROK [on viewscreen]: (to subordinate) Find this vessel.
ARCHER: Wait a minute, wait a minute. They're harmless. We need them,
alive. Just give me a chance to explain.
VOROK [on viewscreen]: Find them! (Three photons light up the
Xyrillians and a tractor beam grabs them.)
KLINGON [on viewscreen]: There are thirty six aboard.
VOROK [on viewscreen]: Bring their Captain to me and execute the
others.
ARCHER: Didn't you hear what I said? I need them alive.
VOROK [on viewscreen]: What you need is to turn your puny ship around
and leave. These aliens violated our security and disrupted our
systems. Both are considered acts of war against the Empire.
ARCHER: I assure you that any damage they've done was unintentional.
They're simply trying to get home.
VOROK [on viewscreen]: They won't get home, but I'm more than willing
to hasten their journey to Sto-Vo-Kor.
ARCHER: Sto-Vo?
HOSHI: The afterlife.
ARCHER: You really don't want to hurt these people. They're actually
very kind. They just had some bad luck with their engines. When we
confronted them, they complied with all our requests.
VOROK [on viewscreen]: You're wasting my time.
T'POL: Less than one month ago, Captain Archer stood in the High
Council Chamber in Kronos. The Chancellor himself called him a man of
honour, a brother. Enterprise is the ship that found Klaang and
returned him to the Empire. Without Klaang, your houses would be at war
with each other. Jonathan Archer is the man who carried out that
rescue. You are in his debt. You would be demonstrating both honour and
wisdom to grant his request.
TUCKER: I'm the one who repaired their warp reactor, or at least I
thought I did. I spent three days on their ship. They have some amazing
technology. If you don't kill them, I'm sure they'd share it with you,
teach you how to use it.
KLINGON [on viewscreen]: What kind of technology?
TUCKER: Well for one, they've got some incredible holography. I don't
know how advanced Klingon holograms are, but these are like nothing I
ever saw before. Press a few buttons and you'll be standing on a
hillside overlooking Kronos. It's unbelievable. Couldn't hurt to take a
look, unless the decompression cycle frightens you.
VOROK [on viewscreen]: I am frightened by nothing, PetaQ.
ARCHER: If you agree to enter their vessel, I'd appreciate it if you
took my Chief Engineer with you.
VOROK [on viewscreen]: He talks too much. I'll bring a security team.
ARCHER: He was there for three days. They trust him. It'll make things
a lot easier.
VOROK [on viewscreen]: If their technology amuses me, I may spare their
lives. I don't need your engineer to help me make that decision.
ARCHER: There's another reason. Commander Tucker has some unfinished
business with the Xyrillians.
VOROK [on viewscreen]: I am not interested in your engineer's business.
ARCHER: There's a pregnancy involved.
VOROK [on viewscreen]: I thought you said you were there to fix their
warp reactor, not to impregnate one of their females. This should be a
lesson to you. Forget it happened.
TUCKER: I'm afraid that's not going to be so easy.
ARCHER: Show him.(Trip lifts his shirt to reveal a growth on his ribs.
The Klingons laugh.)
 [Xyrillian ship]
 TUCKER: Captain Vorok has agreed to consider
releasing your ship in exchange for one or two of your holographic
simulators. It would be a good idea to cooperate.
VOROK: This is a topographical survey of our capital.
TRENA'L: I'd be pleased to give you a demonstration. (he leaves with
the Klingons)
AH'LEN: The reactor worked fine for six days then went offline again.
How did you find us?
TUCKER: It wasn't easy, but we were very motivated.
AH'LEN: I don't understand.(Trip lifts his shirt to show his bulge.)AH'LEN: I
had no idea this could happen with another species. If I'd known.
TUCKER: No need to apologise, but I would be real appreciative if you
could get this out of me, assuming it's safe.
AH'LEN: (scans him) It's still early enough to transfer the embryo to
another host. She looks very healthy.
TUCKER: It's a girl, huh?
 [Xyrillian holodeck]
 (The Klingon simulation is active.)
VOROK: (pointing) You can see my house from here. Can this technology
be adapted to our power matrix?
TRENA'L: I'm sure we can make the appropriate modifications.
 [Bridge]
 VOROK [on viewscreen]: As soon as the installation
is complete, the Xyrillians will be free to go.
ARCHER: I appreciate your co-operation. I hope the next time we meet,
we can be of some help to you.
VOROK [on viewscreen]: Listen to me very carefully. Our debt is repaid.
We have no interest in meeting you again, and if we do, I promise,
you'll regret it.
 [Captain's mess]
 TUCKER: The only thing worse than spending three
hours in a decompression chamber with a bunch of Klingons is doing it
twice in one day. I smelled things in there I hope I never smell again.
ARCHER: Trena'l told me that at full impulse, they can probably get
home in less than a month.
TUCKER: No more hitch-hiking?
ARCHER: That business about the Klingon Chancellor calling me a
brother, was that true?
T'POL: Klingons are known to exaggerate. I saw nothing wrong with doing
the same.
ARCHER: Your appetite seems to be back to normal.
TUCKER: Just eating for one again.
T'POL: I've run a check through the Starfleet database. You might be
pleased to know that this is the first recorded incident of a human
male becoming pregnant.
TUCKER: Just how I always wanted to get into the history books.

  [Bridge]
(Travis is looking at a series of archive pictures
on his station monitor.)
TRAVIS: This was their first view of it.
HOSHI: If you don't look too close, you'd think it was Earth.
TRAVIS: Breaking ground on the town hall.
HOSHI: Is that Captain Mitchell?
TRAVIS: No, I think that's Mitchell.
(Archer enters.)
ARCHER: Are we there yet?
TRAVIS: Three hours seventeen minutes to go, sir.
HOSHI: Travis has been digging through the archives.
TRAVIS: There's tons of data here. Crew manifests, survey photos,
weekly status reports. I was hoping to find something, a clue to what
happened.
ARCHER: You'd be the first.
TRAVIS: I've been fascinated by Terra Nova since I was a kid, sir. I
always thought lost colonies affected boomers more than anyone else.
Something about people who choose to live off-world.
HOSHI: Captain, do you think anyone's still there?
ARCHER: I'll let you know in about three hours and seventeen minutes.
 [Captain's mess]
 T'POL: Terra Nova?
ARCHER: I'm surprised you've never heard of it.
T'POL: I'm not familiar with the early years of human space
exploration.
TUCKER: Really? Every school kid on Earth had to learn about the famous
Vulcan expeditions.
T'POL: Name one.
TUCKER: History was never my best subject.
ARCHER: It was called the Great Experiment. Could humans colonise deep
space? They'd already build New Berlin on the Moon, Utopia Planetia on
Mars, even a few asteroid colonies, but all within our solar system.
When they found an Earth-like planet less than twenty light-years away,
it was hard to resist.
TUCKER: It took them what, nine years to get there?
ARCHER: Nine years there, nine years back, but they made it.
TUCKER: My grandfather remembered seeing their first transmissions when
he was a kid.
T'POL: What happened to them?
ARCHER: People have been trying to answer that question for a long
time. No one's heard from Terra Nova in over seventy years. After the
colony was built, relations with Earth became strained. The Space
Agency figured nothing succeeds like success, so they decided to send
another vessel.
ARCHER: The colonists protested. They'd been there five years, this was
their home. They didn't want another two hundred people arriving. The
folks back on Earth argued that there weren't any other habitable
planets within reach, but the colonists dug their heels in. There were
a few angry messages sent back and forth, then one day nobody heard
from them again.
T'POL: Why didn't you send a vessel to find out what happened?
ARCHER: Nine years there, nine years back, it would have been a pretty
long trip.
T'POL: A Vulcan ship could have made the journey in far less time. Why
didn't you ask them?
TUCKER: Asking favours of the Vulcans usually ends up carrying too high
a price.
T'POL: My experience with humans is limited, but I've come to learn
that they're quite resourceful. Terra Nova may still be there, Captain.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Two hundred thousand kilometres.
ARCHER: Let's see it.
(A blue and white planet appears on the
viewscreen.)
TRAVIS: I promised my dad I'd see this place someday.
ARCHER: Put us in orbit over the colony.
(Hoshi nods that she's opened
a channel.)
ARCHER: Terra Nova colony, this is Captain Jonathan Archer of the
Starship Enterprise. We've come from Earth. Please respond.
HOSHI: No answer, sir.
ARCHER: Any biosigns?
T'POL: No, but the colony appears to be intact. I'm also detecting low
levels of surface radiation.
ARCHER: From what?
T'POL: I can't tell.
ARCHER: Let's take a look.
(The viewscreen zooms in.)
ARCHER: Closer.
TUCKER: Looks like a ghost town.
ARCHER: Let's hope the ghosts can give us some answers. How bad is the
radiation.
T'POL: Less than eight hundred millirads. A few hours of exposure
shouldn't pose a risk.
ARCHER: Trip, take the Bridge. Travis.
(Reed goes too.)
 [Terra Nova Colony]
 (The shuttlepod lands, and two crescent moons hang
in the sky. A bicycle is abandoned, the buildings are tubular framed.)
TRAVIS: A housing unit.
T'POL: No sign of weapons fire, only rust.
ARCHER: Whatever happened, I've got to believe they tried to let Earth
know about it.
TRAVIS: We've got the schematics for the communications tower.
ARCHER: Good. See if the data buffer's intact. We might be able to
access their last transmission logs.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: (to Reed) Walk the perimeter. See what you can find.
T'POL: Judging by the isotope decays, the radiation levels seventy
years ago would have been lethal.
ARCHER: If that's what killed them, where are the bodies?
T'POL: Maybe they left the planet before it could affect them.
ARCHER: That would have been difficult. That's a bulkhead. They
designed their ship to be disassembled. That's how they built the
colony. It was a one-way trip.
(Out in the brush, Reed's scanner beeps)
REED: Hello?
(He sees a figure move, and talks into his communicator.)
REED: We're not
alone, sir. There's someone in the forest.
ARCHER: We're on our way.
 [Cave entrance]
(Reed haa chased the figure all the way to a
cave entrance.)
REED: I believe he went in there.
ARCHER: You get a look at him?
REED: Yeah, he appeared to be a couple of metres tall, biped,
odd-looking scales.
T'POL: This leads to a network of caverns that extend for several
hundred metres.
ARCHER: Archer to Mayweather.
TRAVIS [OC]: Go ahead, sir.
ARCHER: Get back to the shuttle and grab a pair of flashlights. Make it
quick.
TRAVIS [OC]: Yes, sir.
 [Cave tunnel]
 (Armed with flashlights and phase pistols, Reed
and Archer head in while Travis and T'Pol stand guard outside.)
REED: It'd be best if I went first, sir.
(He crawls through a small opening
into another cavern. There's a noise behind them, and they see the tail
of an armadillo-type creature disappearing through another hole.)
ARCHER: After you.
(Further on they find a storeroom with a collection of dead armadillos,
metal cooking pots, knives. Reed spots small faces watching them from
above.)
REED: Captain.
ARCHER: My name is Archer. We're looking for some people. I was hoping
you could help us. (puts down knife) We're not going to hurt you. We're
just trying to find out what happened to them.
(A man rushes in with a
weapon, they stun him and the small faces vanish. A second man come in
and fires a percussion weapon. Archer and Reed run, but the Captain is
hit in the arm.) ARCHER: Which way?
 [Cave entrance]
 T'POL: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
 [Cave tunnel]
 T'POL [OC]: Captain?
ARCHER: We're under attack, and I think we just took a wrong turn. We
could use a little help navigating down here.
 [Cave entrance]
 T'POL: Just a moment. In approximately three
metres, a tunnel will branch off to your left.
 [Cave tunnel]
 T'POL [OC]: Take it.
ARCHER: I don't see a tunnel.
 [Cave entrance]
 T'POL: Correction, ten metres.
 [Cave tunnel]
 (They get back to the small opening they
originally came through. There are shots and Reed falls.)
REED: I'm all right, sir.
(He gets jumped by a man. Arche is on the
other side of the opening.)
ARCHER: Malcolm?
(He looks back through
the opening. There's just a flashlight on the ground, then shots drive
him back.)
ARCHER: Malcolm?
 [Cave entrance]
 (A man comes flying out and jumps Travis. T'Pol
stuns him. Then Archer comes out to gunfire accompaniment.)
TRAVIS: Where's Malcolm?
ARCHER: Go.
(The three leave quickly.)
 [Shuttlecraft]
 ARCHER: Take us up.
TRAVIS: If those aliens killed the colonists, they could kill Malcolm
too.
T'POL: Those weren't aliens. They're human.
 [Corridor]
 TRAVIS: I don't get it. If they're human, why were
they shooting at us?
 [Turbolift]
 ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge. What have you found?
TUCKER [OC]: We've got a
 [Situation room]
 TUCKER: Pretty good picture of those caverns, and
we've picked up fifty two biosigns so far. All human.
 [Turbolift]
 ARCHER: The only one I'm interested in right now
is Lieutenant Reed. We've got to get him out of there.
 [Situation room]
 ARCHER [OC]: Have you found him?
TUCKER: Yes, sir. He's about ninety metres below the surface.
HOSHI: He's not responding to hails, Captain, but he's alive.
 [Turbolift]
 ARCHER: Have Doctor Phlox join us in the Situation
room.
TUCKER [OC]: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: If these are the descendants of the original colonists, they've
never seen other humans before. Maybe we look as strange to them as
they did to us.
 [Situation room]
 TUCKER: Twelve point six kilometres worth of
tunnels. Looks like they even dug a few wells. The geology's a little
shaky. Some of these passageways have collapsed.
T'POL: They may have been driven underground by the radiation.
ARCHER: Have you figured out what caused it?
TUCKER: Not yet.
HOSHI: What do they do for food?
PHLOX: Many species feed on underground fauna and flora. Tubers, fungi,
insects.
ARCHER: They also hunt some kind of burrowing animal. Where's Malcolm?
TUCKER: Right here, sir. There are two people with him.
TRAVIS: Can we use the transporter?
TUCKER: He's too deep.
T'POL: A section of this tunnel is collapsed. It's empty. If we could
get into it, we could clear the obstruction with phase pistols. We'd be
less than twenty metres from Lieutenant Reed.
HOSHI: What about these two? We have to assume they're armed.
TUCKER: A stun grenade would solve that problem.
ARCHER: I don't want to risk any more casualties. Despite how they
look, they're still human. We've got to find some way to talk to them.
TRAVIS: They didn't seem too eager to talk.
ARCHER: If I can't make first contact with other humans I don't have
any business being out here. Malcolm was shot. Grab your medical kit
and meet me at the launch bay.
PHLOX: Right away, sir.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: (to T'Pol) Try to find out what irradiated the surface. You and
Hoshi get to work on that data buffer. I want to know if they tried to
send any messages to Earth.
 [Planet surface]
 PHLOX: Do you think they know we've returned?
ARCHER: Hard not to hear a shuttlepod landing on your roof.
(He stops
walking.)
ARCHER: I'm unarmed. I just want to talk.
(Both raise their arms.)
ARCHER: I'm
concerned about my officer. I'd like to see him.
(Two men appear with
weapons and lead them away.)
 [Cavern]
 (They are taken to where Reed is being held
prisoner.)
REED: Fancy meeting you here.
ARCHER: How's the leg?
REED: I've lost a bit of blood, sir, but I don't think it's too
serious.
PHLOX: May I have my medical supplies, please?
(An older man with white and blue face markings comes in, accompanied
by an old woman.)
JAMIN: Human?
ARCHER: That's right.
JAMIN: What's that?
PHLOX: My name is Phlox. I am a Denobulan. I'm Captain Archer's
physician.
JAMIN: You tracked from Earth on a sky ship.
ARCHER: It's called Enterprise.
JAMIN: To what, gut the rest of us?
ARCHER: No. We're here to find out what happened to the colony. We came
to help you.
ATHAN: Novans have had enough help from you.
JAMIN: We're not so easy to hunt as diggers. Go back to the overside or
we'll seal your passage.
ARCHER: I told you, we're not here to hurt anybody.
JAMIN: Take that one, and don't track back.
ARCHER: All right, but he won't be able to get through these tunnels on
one leg. My doctor needs to treat him.
(Phlox gets his medical case back and starts scanning Reed's leg.)
ARCHER: What
makes you think we're here to hurt you?
JAMIN: Humans hurt Novans.
ARCHER: Why do you think that?
JAMIN: They gutted us. Our families, our before-families.
ARCHER: I don't understand.
NADET: Poison rain. I was no taller than a digger, but I can still see
back. We lived on the overside, then the humans dropped the poison,
burned our skin, gutted the grown ones. There was no place to go but
here.
ARCHER: To the underside. I think I know what you're talking about. The
poison rain, it was some kind of radiation. I don't know what caused it
but I'm sure it wasn't humans.
PHLOX: He can walk, more or less, but I'll need to get him back to
Sickbay to remove the projectile.
ARCHER: I know this'll be hard for you to accept, but you're the
descendants of human beings. Your ancestors colonised this planet over
seventy years ago. They came from Earth, just like I did. I don't know
what happened, but maybe we could work together and find out.
ATHAN: He speaks in shale.
ARCHER: If that's your way of calling me a liar, give me a chance to
prove what I'm saying. My sky ship has tools that can help us find out
what happened here.
JAMIN: No.
PHLOX: Are you aware that your mother is sick?
(Phlox refers to his
scanner.)
PHLOX: This is one of the tools the Captain spoke of. It can tell me
all kinds of things about the inside of your body. She has an illness
that we call lung cancer, but it's easily cured.
ARCHER: Doctor Phlox can make her well, but she'd have to come back to
our ship.
ATHAN: This is shale. They want to trap us on the overside to gut us.
JAMIN: How long of a day would it take?
PHLOX: Not long. A few hours at most.
JAMIN: Hours?
ARCHER: She'd be back before the sun rises on the overside. Let us help
you.
JAMIN: We track together. This one stays.
ARCHER: He needs to be treated as well.
PHLOX: He'll be fine for a few hours.
REED: Don't worry about me, sir. I was just getting used to the place.
ARCHER: Probably best if you lead the way.
 [Shuttlepod]
 (The old woman is fascinated as they approach
Enterprise to dock. Archer is at the controls.)
ARCHER: That's Enterprise. It's a lot like the ship that
brought the colonists to this planet. It was called the Conestoga.
Maybe you were born on board, or were you born after your parents got
here?
NADET: My parents were Novans. They came from the overside.
 [Sickbay]
 (The woman is in the body scanner, and very
unhappy.)
NADET [OC]: No more! Let me out!
JAMIN: Open the passage.
PHLOX: Just a few more seconds.
JAMIN: Open it.
ARCHER: It's all right.
(It opens. She comes out and sits up
immediately.)
PHLOX: My apologies for any discomfort.
JAMIN: Is she healed?
PHLOX: Not quite. First we have to determine how far her sickness has
spread.
(He refers to a monitor.)
PHLOX: That is you. The inside of you, anyway.
This picture will tell me what kind of treatment she'll require.
Interstitial tumours. The malignancy has spread to her lymphatic
system. She'll need a series of cytolitic injections.
JAMIN: Injections?
ARCHER: Medicine. He's just going to give her some medicine.
PHLOX: I'll need a few minutes to synthesise it.
ARCHER: I've got some other pictures you might like to see. One of my
crewmen found these in our database.
(Archer calls up the expedition files
Travis was looking at.)
ARCHER: They might help you remember what it was like
living on the overside before the poison rain.
JAMIN: It's human shale. They're confusing your path. You'll lose your
tracks in this.
ARCHER: I'm just trying to help you see how you got here.
JAMIN: All I see is digger filth.
ARCHER: Well look again. Because whether you want to believe it or not,
we're both human.
JAMIN: Bury your drawings.
(Archer clears
monitor.)
ARCHER: Doctor,
keep me posted.
 Captain's starlog, supplemental. Sub-Commander
T'Pol has discovered the remnants of an impact crater that could
explain the radiation.
 [Situation room]
 ARCHER: How far away is it?
T'POL: About five hundred kilometres north.
TUCKER: How deep?
T'POL: It's been partially filled in by erosion over the years, but I'm
reading impact fractures down to nearly two thousand metres.
ARCHER: Comet or an asteroid?
T'POL: An asteroid. A large one. The tectonic analysis puts the impact
at approximately seventy years ago.
ARCHER: The poison rain.
T'POL: The geology was comprised primarily of beresium ore. The
thermo-shock would have created a radioactive cloud that probably
covered the northern hemisphere for more than a year.
TUCKER: They spent all those years getting here, and for what?
 [Cavern]
 REED: That's an old MK-33, isn't it? Or is it a
34? Impressive body armour you're wearing. Did you make it yourself?
Right. I don't suppose there's a lavatory on the premises, is there? I
wouldn't mind freshening up a little. No. Didn't think so.
(Athan puts down his gun and picks up a digger carcass to eat.)
ATHAN: Is
your belly
hollow?
REED: That all depends. What's for dinner?
(Athan puts another 'bowl' in front of Reed.)
ATHAN:
Digger meat.
REED: Looks a little undercooked.
ATHAN: Humans are like damp moss. They rot on the underside.
REED: (eating a piece) Not bad.
(Some young people are playing wind instruments made from digger skulls
and other bones, a haunting gently melody.)
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in.
HOSHI: It's a transmission, sir. It's the last one anyone made, as far
as we can tell. It was still in the buffer.
TRAVIS: It's Captain Mitchell.
MITCHELL [OC]: No matter how angry Logan's threats may have seemed,
there had to have been a way of dealing with this other than attacking
us. Nearly half the adults are dead, including Doctor Tracey, and
everyone else is getting sick, except for the younger children. If they
have any chance of surviving, the least you could do is have the
Vulcans send a ship for them, but for all I know they were the ones you
talked into attacking us. You wanted Terra Nova enough to do this? Well
it's yours now, but I doubt you'll be very pleased with what you find
when you get here.
TRAVIS: Mark Logan was the head of the opposition, the ones who were
against a second wave of settlers. Supposedly, he threatened to fire at
any ship that came into orbit.
HOSHI: The irony is that Captain Mitchell's message never reached
Earth. The debris in the atmosphere was too dense.
ARCHER: So, for some reason, the young kids survive and begin living
underground. Their last memories of their parents are hearing them
blame humans for destroying the colony. The idea that humans are the
enemy has been embedded in them for more than two generations. This
isn't going to be easy.
PHLOX [OC]: Sickbay to Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
PHLOX [OC]: Could you come see me, please.
 [Just outside Sickbay]
 ARCHER: Is everything all right?
PHLOX: Nadet's cancer has been eliminated.
ARCHER: Nice work.
PHLOX: But I found something quite troubling. Both she and her son are
showing signs of microcellular decay in their endocrine systems. Their
underground water supply has probably become contaminated. I don't have
any medication to treat this, and it's only going to get worse.
ARCHER: Would bringing them to the surface help?
PHLOX: T'Pol says the soil and foliage is going to remain irradiated
for at least another decade.
ARCHER: How's she doing?
PHLOX: She's as disagreeable as she was before I treated her.
ARCHER: Bring them to the Situation room.
 [Situation room]
 JAMIN: We are not leaving.
ARCHER: It's not safe for you anymore. When the asteroid hit, the
fallout contained certain poisons. Humans under the age of four or five
can usually build up an immunity to them. That's why they survived.
PHLOX: For the last two or three generations that immunity kept you all
alive, but now the poisons have gotten into your water supply. As
Captain Archer says, it is no longer safe.
NADET: You humans tried to gut our go-befores when they lived on the
overside. Now you're trying to gut us.
T'POL: Doctor Phlox just saved your life. Perhaps you should give him
the benefit of the doubt. After all, he's not human. Neither am I.
JAMIN: Giant rocks falling from the sky. Shale, it's all shale! Take us
back.
ARCHER: I went through about two to three hundred photographs before I
found this.
(A family group, with a small child.)
ARCHER: Look familiar, Nadet?
NADET: It's the overside, before the poison rain.
ARCHER: And what about the people?
NADET: Humans.
ARCHER: What were humans doing in your colony before it was destroyed?
I think I can help answer that.
(He zooms in on it.)
ARCHER: You're sure none of
these people look familiar? From the data we retrieved on this
photograph, we're pretty sure this woman's name was Vera Fuller. Ring a
bell?
JAMIN: It's the medicine they put in you. They're confusing your path.
We need to leave.
ARCHER: Look closely.
(Archer zooms in on the girl on the woman's lap.)
ARCHER: Vera
Fuller. What do you remember?
JAMIN: Shale! They're trying to trap you.
ARCHER: Vera had a daughter named Bernadette. She'd be about seventy
five now in Earth years.
NADET: Nadet? Bernadette? You say this is me?
JAMIN: They're trying to make us leave the underside. If we're not back
before day, your crewman will be gutted. Take us back.
ARCHER: Is her treatment finished?
PHLOX: I should take one more thoracic scan.
ARCHER: Fine. As soon as you're done, bring them to the Launch bay.
Sub-Commander.
(They leave the group.)
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: There are fifty eight human beings in
those tunnels and they're all going to die if we don't get them out of
it, and what do they think? They think we're a bunch of hostile aliens
trying to take their colony over.
T'POL: Stun grenades.
ARCHER: What?
T'POL: Commander Tucker's continued to enhance the sensor resolution of
their tunnels. We could transport stun grenades to specific locations,
detonate them, and use both shuttlepods to bring them back to the ship.
ARCHER: And then what, put them in chains?
T'POL: I'm sure Mister Reed could devise appropriate restraints.
ARCHER: What the hell do you think this is, a slave shi? We can't
relocate them by force.
T'POL: The alternative was made quite clear by Doctor Phlox.
ARCHER: We have to convince them that returning to Earth is the right
thing. We can't take them by force.
T'POL: Are you certain it is the right thing?
ARCHER: What are you talking about?
T'POL: When you get them back to Earth, what will you do? Send them to
school, teach them to read and write, wear human clothing, eat human
food, teach them to live on the surface, enjoy the sunshine?
ARCHER: You're damn straight. They're human beings. It's their
birthright. It might take a little while, but they'll adapt. It's a
hell of a lot better than dying down in those tunnels.
T'POL: They've lived in those tunnels for three generations. You can't
just pluck them up and bring them to a strange world and hope they'll
learn to conform. You'd be destroying their identity, destroying the
Novan culture.
ARCHER: Archer to Tucker.
TUCKER [OC]: Captain.
ARCHER: Get up here on the double and bring your maps with you.
 [Situation room]
 TUCKER: The debris cloud reached to about here,
ten or twelve degrees north of the equator.
ARCHER: Southern hemisphere?
T'POL: Unaffected by the asteroid.
PHLOX [OC]: Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead, Doc.
PHLOX [OC]: The two Novans are in Shuttlepod one. Will you be escorting
them back to the surface?
ARCHER: I'll be there in a couple of minutes. There's got to be similar
underground topography on one of these southern continents. Caves,
caverns. Find them. Put that on a PADD for me. And it wouldn't hurt if
they were crawling with those, what do they call them, diggers.
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER: Your planet has three large islands to the
south. We call them continents. The climate is nearly identical to your
overside. We don't know how similar the underside is, but my people are
working on that now. The important thing is, the poison rain never fell
there. You'd be safe. Your children would be safe. You could even spend
time on the overside if you wanted to.
JAMIN: If our tunnels are infected you wouldn't want them so badly.
TRAVIS: We don't. We only want to help you, make you healthy.
ARCHER: Was that photograph of Vera Fuller and her daughter shale? Do
you really believe we created it to trick you? You're human. So am I.
Humans help each other.
JAMIN: When we track back to the underside, we'll return your crewman
only if you promise to leave.
TRAVIS: I've got the landing site locked in, Captain.
ARCHER: Would you at least talk to your people, tell them what I
proposed?
(the shuttlepod lands at the original colony site. There's a sudden
jolt)
TRAVIS: Our thrusters are down.
(The pod shakes.)
ARCHER: Fire them up again.
(But the pod falls through the ground into
a crevice.)
TRAVIS: Pod One to Enterprise, we've got an emergency.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Is anyone hurt?
 [Shuttlepod]
(The pod come to a halt.)
 ARCHER: We're okay, but
getting out of here is going to be tricky. Can you give us the
coordinates
(The pod moves again.)
T'POL [OC]: Captain?
ARCHER: I think we're done dropping. How far have we gone?
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER: You're down about eight metres. Looks like
a couple of the abandoned tunnels gave way.
 [Shuttlepod]
 JAMIN: Open it. Open it.
ARCHER: Hold on. Trip, if I open the port hatch, what am I going to
find?
JAMIN: Open it!
TUCKER [OC]: You're on the floor of a stable tunnel. You should be
okay.
ARCHER: You're going to have to build a rig to get this pod back on the
surface.
TUCKER [OC]: Aye, sir.
 [Tunnel]
 (The hatch catches against the tunnel wall, but
they can squeeze out.)
JAMIN: We're in the downslope passage. We need to pass the cut-through
to get to your crewman. Give me your pistol.
ARCHER: What are you talking about?
JAMIN: If you want to see your human alive, you'll give me your
pistol.
(Archer hands it over. Jamin and Nadet lead the way.)
ARCHER: Stay here with the shuttle. Keep your comm. open.
(Travis
throws him a torch.)
VOICE [OC}: Help!
ARCHER: Hold on a second. Do you hear that?
VOICE [OC]: Help! Help me! Can anyone
NADET: It's Akary.
 [Well]
 (Akary is trapped under a log at the bottom of the
well.)
AKARY: Help! Help!
JAMIN: He must have fallen when your sky ship quaked the tunnels. Are
you hurt?
AKARY: I'm leg-broke. The wood has me sealed down.
JAMIN: Would you risk your bones to save a Novan?
ARCHER: I'll do what I can, but I doubt I can make it down there.
JAMIN: We'll track together, but you'll need to trust me.
(Jamin leads the way, but Archer slips and is dangling from one hand
until Jamin hauls him back to safety. They make it to the
bottom.)
JAMIN: The
water's rising. We have to hurry.
(They heave at the log, but they
can't move it.)
ARCHER: I need you to give me my phase pistol. My gun.
JAMIN: Why, so you can go free your hostage?
ARCHER: So I can free this man. It's your turn to trust me.
(Jamin
hands it over and Archer uses it to cut the log in half.)
ARCHER: Give me a
hand. Ready.
(They lift, and Akary wriggles free.)
 [Cavern]
 (They carry Akary into the cave where Reed is
being held.)
REED: Captain.
ARCHER: How are you holding up?
REED: Not badly, all things considered, but I really wouldn't mind
getting this bullet out of my leg.
NADET: Tell them. Tell them what Archer said about the islands to the
south.
JAMIN: They promised to leave. Let them go. We'll be fine here.
NADET: We're not fine. None of us is fine. We're rotting, all of us.
JAMIN: They've promised to leave.
NADET: I've seen back. Vera Fuller was my mother. That girl in the
picture was me, a human girl. Our go-befores shared the same path. We
should listen.
 [Captain's mess]
 TRAVIS: Ever heard of Judge Crater?
T'POL: Crater?
TRAVIS: Disappeared in the early twentieth century. How about Amelia
Earhart?
T'POL: No.
TRAVIS: 1937.
Never found a trace of her.
A lot of people spent years, decades, trying to figure out what
happened to them, but neither of those mysteries holds a candle to
Terra Nova. And we solved it!
TUCKER: Did more than that. Those people were a year or two away from
extinction. We didn't just find them, we saved their lives.
TRAVIS: All these years wondering about that colony. I never thought
I'd become part of their history.
ARCHER: Tell you what, Travis. Why don't you put together the report
for Starfleet. If I'm not mistaken, it'll be headline news back home.
TUCKER: The Terra Nova puzzle, solved at last, as told by Ensign Travis
Mayweather.
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir.

The Enterprise Transcripts - The Andorian Incident
The
Andorian Incident
 Mission date: Unknown
Original Airdate: 31 Oct, 2001
  (The
peace and tranquility of a Vulcan monastery is shattered by the
intrusion of four blue-skinned humanoids.)
 [Ready room]
 TUCKER: Maybe it's just me, but it seems like
these Vulcan star charts take all the fun out of it. We're supposed to
be explorers, aren't we?
ARCHER: That's the general idea.
TUCKER: Where's the exploration in going places people have already
been?
ARCHER: Well, for one thing, we've never been to these places. For
another, remember that protostar we ran across last week?
TUCKER: Yeah.
ARCHER: I'm not seeing it here.
TUCKER: Are you saying those Vulcan star charts aren't all that
accurate? If that's true, good luck getting them to admit it.
ARCHER: Come in.
T'POL: You wanted to see me, Captain.
ARCHER: As a matter of fact, Mister Tucker and I were looking at these
star charts. There's a planet a few light years off our current
heading.
T'POL: I'm familiar with it.
ARCHER: Well the data indicates there's a remote outpost right here on
the northern hemisphere.
T'POL: P'Jem.
ARCHER: I take it this P'Jem is under Vulcan jurisdiction?
T'POL: It's an ancient spiritual retreat. A remote sanctuary for
Kolinahr and peaceful meditation.
TUCKER: Kolinahr?
T'POL: The Vulcan purging of emotion.
ARCHER: That sounds interesting. How do you think they'd feel about a
visit?
T'POL: P'Jem is a place of quiet contemplation, Captain. I'm not
certain we'd be welcome.
TUCKER: It's because Vulcans think we smell bad, isn't it?
ARCHER: It's not every day we get a chance to see an ancient Vulcan
monastery. I'd say a stop-over's too good a chance to pass up. Unless
you disagree?
T'POL: I'll research the proper protocols.
ARCHER: Good. Archer to helm.
TRAVIS [OC]: Go ahead.
ARCHER: Prepare to lay in a course correction. T'Pol will give you the
coordinates.
TRAVIS [OC]: Understood.
 [Mess hall]
 PHLOX: Well, you must be looking forward to
visiting the sanctuary.
T'POL: It was the Captain's idea.
PHLOX: But such an opportunity to appreciate your cultural history.
T'POL: It is a Vulcan sanctuary, if that's what you mean.
PHLOX: Precisely my point. You'll be able to introduce some of your own
people to your new crew. Oh, I believe I see the source of your
misgivings. Being seen with a human crew.
T'POL: It could create a certain awkwardness.
PHLOX: May I?
(He picks up with his fingers a piece of the salad
she's eating
with knife and fork.)
PHLOX: I confess I feel awkward on this ship
myself, sometimes, out of place. But what is that Vulcan motto?
Infinite diversity.
T'POL: In infinite combinations.
PHLOX: And what is diversity but a celebration of differences. I wonder
if you might remind me about our mission on this vessel. Please,
indulge me.
T'POL: Our mission is to make contact with those whom humans consider
new life and new civilisations.
PHLOX: In other words, to seek infinite diversity.
T'POL: I suppose so.
PHLOX: Well then, it seems to me a cultural exchange between your
Vulcan brethren and your human crew is simply a furtherance of that
mission.
 [Launch bay]
 TUCKER: They don't even know we're coming?
T'POL: It wasn't possible to hail them. The monks consider technology a
distraction from their spiritual pursuits.
ARCHER: I don't like dropping in on people unannounced.
T'POL: It won't be a problem as long as we observe the proper
protocols. When we arrive, we'll be greeted by a Vulcan Elder. You
should not speak to him or any member of the order unless spoken to
first. If they appear to be meditating, do not approach them or attempt
to make conversation. Also, maintain quiet at all times and do not
touch or disturb any artefacts, relics or ornamentation. If we arrive
at their time of communal kolinahr it's likely we'll be turned away. At
the conclusion of our visit we'll be offered the Stone of J'Kah as a
gesture of salutation. Accept it, then bow slightly and observe a
respectful silence for approximately five seconds.
TUCKER: I thought Starfleet training was tough.
 [Outside the monastery]
 TUCKER: You say this is a place to purge emotions?
Looks like somebody had to purge pretty bad. He bashed the door in.
T'POL: The temple is almost three thousand years old, Commander. You
can't expect it to be in pristine condition.
(She pulls on a big bell
rope. After a few moments, Archer pushes the doors open anyway and they
enter.)
 [Atrium]
 (T'Pol whispers with the sole man present.)
T'POL: He says we have arrived at the time of kolinahr. The order must
remain in silent reflection throughout the lunar cycle. They are not to
be disturbed.
ARCHER: Oh, that's too bad. At least we got to see the place.
T'POL: (to Vulcan) Your service honours us. Before we leave, may I
request the offering of the J'Kah stone for my distinguished guests.
ELDER: Please wait.
(He leaves.)
ARCHER: Something wrong?
T'POL: It's probably nothing.
ARCHER: But?
T'POL: This is the main atrium. There should be more than one member of
the order present, and the icon in that shrine is perched at an odd
angle.
TUCKER: Oddly perched, huh. We'd better call Starfleet Command.
T'POL: That's not all, Captain. The Vulcan Elder seems agitated.
TUCKER: (as the Elder returns) You call that agitated?
ARCHER: You know, I think the oldest monastery I ever visited was in
Ngari, Tibet, but it wasn't nearly as big as this place.
T'POL: I've heard it can take days to explore this site.
(Tucker stoops by the fallen jar.)
TUCKER:
It'd take at least that long to clean
the place up.
ELDER: Forgive the disarray. Kolinahr encourages the members of our
order to face their vestigial emotions. The repercussions can sometimes
be violent. Please. This is the stone of J'Kah, which represents the
foundation of all we believe. A life of order and control through
logic.
(Archer puts his hand on the stone.)
ELDER: Ishte acula bestalma itok,
J'Kah.
ARCHER: What's all that mean, anyway?
ELDER: It is a traditional litany, passed down for generations.
ARCHER: Does it mean I get good luck or something?
TUCKER: You're thinking of the Blarney Stone, Captain, or when you pat
the Buddha's belly. 
(Archer sees a blue face reflected in a polished bowl.)
ARCHER:
I guess
you're right. Too bad we didn't bring a camera, huh, Commander?
(Tucker
joins him near blue-face's hiding place.)
ELDER: Please, you must leave now.
TUCKER: You ever been to San Francisco Zoo? Now there's something you
should see.
(The two men break through the partition and grab the eavesdropper, but
the other three intruders appear with weapons.)
ARCHER: Friends of yours? Somehow I didn't think so.
(As they are marched away.)
KEVAL:
Stop looking at me.
TUCKER: Okay, okay. Don't get your antennas in a twist.
 [Large room]
(Everyone say Hi! to Jeffrey
Combs.)
SHRAN: Why didn't you tell us one of your people
was aboard?
ELDER: It's an Earth vessel. I didn't know.
THOLOS: What does that mean, Earth? What is that?
ARCHER: It's where we're from. It's our homeworld.
SHRAN: Why did you come here? Answer me, pink skin.
ARCHER: This planet was along our course. We only came to visit the
sanctuary.
SHRAN: Liar. What's your mission? Are you a supply ship bringing them
more surveillance equipment?
ARCHER: We're not bringing them anything.
THOLOS: You brought her.
ARCHER: She's my Science officer.
SHRAN: So you admit you're working with the Vulcans.
ARCHER: I'll admit I have a Vulcan Science officer and that I came here
out of curiosity. Now, if you don't mind my asking, what are you doing
here?
(Shran hits Archer.)
TUCKER: Hey! He's telling the truth. We came for a visit, that's all.
SHRAN: We scanned your ship in orbit. You're very well armed for people
who came for a visit. You and the pink skins have proven what we
already knew. This is far more than a sanctuary.
THOLOS: (to T'Pol) I'll enjoy having you, as a prisoner.
(The Andorians
leave.)
TUCKER: Now these guys are agitated.
T'POL: They're Andorians, Captain. They're known for their suspicious
and volatile nature.
ARCHER: Andorians?
T'POL: Yes, sir.
VULCAN: Our two species are from neighbouring systems. We've been in
conflict for many years.
T'POL: They resent our superior reasoning and our technology. They even
believe that we intend to mount an invasion on their homeworld.
ELDER: In order to alleviate tensions, we negotiated a treaty, but some
Andorian factions still believe we're bent on conquest.
TUCKER: What do they want with a three thousand year old temple?
ELDER: They believe we are hiding a long range sensor array. This is a
place of introspection, Captain. There are no spies her, and no
technology.
TUCKER: So what are you going to do, just sit here and let them ransack
the place?
VULCAN: Typically, they make a great display of their indignance. When
they find nothing, they leave.
ELDER: The Andorians were here twice before and both times left within
a day. Unfortunately your arrival has amplified their suspicions.
VULCAN: You've endangered us all.
TUCKER: No good deed goes unpunished.
 [Situation room]
 REED: The shuttle's sensors should have picked it
up.
HOSHI: They went to visit some monks. Why would they scan for alien
ships?
REED: It should be standard procedure, that's why. In any event, there
it is.
TRAVIS: There what is?
REED: A vessel, not Vulcan, and it's less than one kilometre from our
shuttlepod.
TRAVIS: Not a lot of room on that landing platform. Maybe they're just
some other visitors.
REED: Well, I for one would like to know who these visitors are. And
why havenn't we heard from the landing party?
HOSHI: You can't expect them to check in every ten minutes.
REED: Maybe that should be standard procedure as well.
HOSHI: You sure you're not over-reacting? They're probably just taking
a tour, observing some kind of meditation ritual.
 [Atrium]
 SHRAN: Where's the sensor array?
ARCHER: From what I'm told there isn't one.
SHRAN: (hitting Archer hard) Where is it!
ARCHER: I don't know.
SHRAN: You humans obviously have emotions. I find it curious that you'd
select a Vulcan as your science officer.
ARCHER: Believe me, she wasn't my first choice.
SHRAN: Why a Vulcan? (He knocks him down.) SHRAN: Why a Vulcan?
ARCHER: She was assigned to us by the Vulcan High Command.
SHRAN: You take orders from the High Command?
ARCHER: No. For the last time, we just came to see the temple.
(communicator chirps) That's my ship, Enterprise. They're trying to
contact me.
(Tholos knocks him down, and Shran opens the communicator.)
SHRAN: Enterprise.
 [Bridge]
 REED: Yes. I'm looking for Captain Archer.
SHRAN [OC]: He's a prisoner of the Andorian Imperial Guard. We know
you're in collaboration with the Vulcans.
REED: Let me talk to the Captain.
SHRAN [OC]: Your ship
 [Atrium]
 SHRAN: Is under constant surveillance. Arm your
weapons or make any attempt to approach the surface and I'll kill the
hostages.
(He smashes the communicator)
ARCHER: Wait!
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: I've lost the signal.
REED: Try T'Pol or Commander Tucker.
(In the monastery Shran smashes each communicator that chirps.)
HOSHI: No response.
REED: Have the launch bay put shuttlepod two on standby.
TRAVIS: You heard what he said. If we try to send more people.
REED: I don't take orders from a comm. voice, Ensign. Not unless that
voice belongs to the Captain. Take a look at the Vulcan database. See
if it has anything on these Andorians.
HOSHI: Aye, sir.
 [Atrium]
 KEVAL: We've searched all the chambers in the
eastern tower.
SHRAN: Have you checked the living quarters?
KEVAL: Not yet.
THOLOS: Perhaps if we decapitate one or two of those monks he'll start
telling us the truth.
SHRAN: Is that something you could live with, Captain?
ARCHER: I've already told you the truth.
 [Large room]
 ELDER: How long have you lived on the Earth ship?
T'POL: Nine weeks and four days.
ELDER: The smell must be intolerable.
T'POL: You get used to it, and I was given a nasal numbing agent.
(Two Andorians return with Archer and throw him to the ground before
leaving again.)
ARCHER: Whose idea was it to visit this place? These guys are serious.
They're going to start killing you people if they don't find what
they're looking for.
ELDER: There is nothing to find.
ARCHER: I don't think they're buying that. Not this time. Loks like
there are four of them. I saw some kind of scanning console. They
talked a lot about searching rooms.
TUCKER: You'd think they could find whatever it is they're looking for
with those antennas of theirs.
ARCHER: They answered a hail from Enterprise. They threatened to kill
us all if anyone attempts a rescue.
T'POL: Mister Reed wouldn't be that reckless.
ARCHER: I didn't recruit my tactical officer to sit on his butt when
he's threatened. The Andorians smashed our communicators. The longer
we're out of contact the more likely Malcolm will put together a
landing party, warning or no warning.
TUCKER: Knowing him, a heavily armed landing party.
ARCHER: It's just a matter of time. So if anyone has a suggestion, I'm
all ears. No offence.
ELDER: There is an option. A transmitter. It's very old.
ARCHER: You said you had no technology.
ELDER: It hasn't been used in many years. It may not even be working.
TUCKER: I never met a busted radio I couldn't fix.
ARCHER: Where is this transmitter?
VULCAN: In the catacombs.
TUCKER: Catacombs.
ELDER: Please listen to me, Captain. There are hidden passages beneath
us where we keep our most sacred relics, our honoured dead. If the
Andorians discover them they will damage our culture in ways you can't
begin to understand.
(The Elder turns a statue and pushes open a panel.)
TUCKER: For people without emotion, you sure have a flair for the
dramatic.
(He and the Vulcan enter the passage, carrying burning
torches.)
 [Catacombs passageway]
 (Tucker is so busy peering into dark alcoves that
he walks straight into a mummy propped against the passage wall.)
VULCAN: Master Haadok, one of the founders of P'Jem. The transmitter is
this way.
TUCKER: Fellas.
 [Catacombs chamber]
(Tucker spota a not so cobwebby door.)  TUCKER: What's
down there?
VULCAN: The reliquary. Our most sacred artefacts are kept there. This
is the transmitter.
TUCKER: Looks like a krellide power cell.
 [Large room - night]
 (The Andorians do a quick head count and leave
again. Tucker resumes work on the transmitter. The Elder offers a blanket.)
ELDER: There is one to spare.
TUCKER: No thanks. It'll just get in my way.
ELDER: (to Archer) It's only going to get colder.
ARCHER: (to T'Pol) You take it.
T'POL: You need it more than I do.
ARCHER: Do the Andorians have a transporter?
T'POL: No.
ARCHER: That gives us the element of surprise. We could bring an
assault team right into the atrium.
T'POL: The sound of the transporter alone would alert the guards.
They'd start firing before the team was fully resequenced.
ARCHER: What about this room? By the time the Andorians detected the
transport we'd be armed and ready.
T'POL: For what? A fire fight in close quarters with a dozen monks at
risk?
ARCHER: If you've got any better ideas? (He offers a share of the
blanket.) ARCHER: There's room in here.
T'POL: I'm fine.
ARCHER: You're freezing.
T'POL: It's been twenty four hours since I took my nasal numbing agent.
The cold is preferable to the odour.
ARCHER: Come on. (She gets under the blanket with him.)
T'POL: An armed assault would put all of our lives at risk, not to
mention the destruction of the sanctuary itself.
ARCHER: I'd say our lives are already at risk.
T'POL: Tensions between Andoria and Vulcan are high. Any casualties
would only make matters worse.
ARCHER: It seems like you're letting them walk all over you. They come
in here, they smash your relics, they beat up your people, then you
just sit back and wait for them to walk away?
T'POL: We don't believe in responding to violence with violence.
ARCHER: I admire your ethics, but right now a little violence might
help.
T'POL: You're beginning to sound like an Andorian.
ARCHER: You know, I came here hoping to gain a little insight into the
Vulcan mind. It looks like I'm getting it. You people think you're so
damned enlightened. (To the rest of the monks listening.) ARCHER: Problem? I'd
like to find a peaceful solution too, but I don't think that's going to
happen. However we end up dealing with this, I need to know I can count
on you.
T'POL: Are you questioning my loyalty?
ARCHER: I just want to know where we stand.
T'POL: I have never disobeyed your orders. (rolls over and takes all
the blanket with her)
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Sir, you're wearing a hole in the deck
plating.
REED: What is it?
HOSHI: Transmission from the surface. It's a modulated EM signal, very
weak.
REED: Put it through.
TUCKER [OC]: Enterprise, this is Commander Tucker. Repeat, Enterprise,
this is Commander Tucker.
REED: This is Enterprise. We can barely read you, Commander.
 [Catacombs chamber]
 REED [OC]: What's your status?
TUCKER: Guess you heard we kind of walked into a hostage situation. The
whole place has been taken over by Andorians.
REED [OC]: Andorians, yes.
 [Bridge]
 REED: I've been reading about them in the Vulcan
database. Militaristic.
 [Catacombs chamber]
 REED [OC]: Blue skinned.
TUCKER: That's them.
REED [OC]: Well, what do they want?
TUCKER: They seem to think this place is some kind of a spy station.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER [OC]: They're looking for a sensor array.
The Captain says to sit tight.
 [Catacombs chamber]
 TUCKER: He doesn't want to provoke them any more
than we already have. He also said to tell you we're working on a way
out of here.
 [Bridge]
 REED: Are you certain we can't negotiate?
 [Catacomb chamber]
 TUCKER: The Captain came back from his last
negotiation with a face full of bruises.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER [OC]: We'll be in touch.
REED: Understood.
 [Large room - next morning]
 (Archer uses coins to make a map.)  ARCHER: Do any of
these tunnels lead to the outside?
ELDER: No.
ARCHER: What about this reliquary?
VULCAN: No one's entered it in years.
ELDER: To do so would be blasphemy.
TUCKER: I saw an old stairwell down there, maybe a metre wide. It was
right about here.
T'POL: That would almost be directly beneath the atrium.
TUCKER: There were three dim lights coming from the top. It looked
something like this.
 [Atrium]
 KEVAL: How many times do we have to search the
same rooms?
SHRAN: Are you losing faith in our mission?
KEVAL: We've looked everywhere, we've run a thousand scans.
SHRAN: The Vulcans are very deceptive. It's here, I'm sure of it. If we
back down now, everything we've fought for is meaningless. If nothing
else, remember that, Keval.
TUCKER [OC]: Hey! Can you hear me? Hello? Anybody out there?
 [Large room]
 ARCHER: (to Shran) I need to speak with you alone.
I have some information for you.
 [Atrium]
 SHRAN: What is it.
ARCHER: Well, for one thing, I needed some fresh air. You ever been
stuck in a room full of Vulcans for twelve hours?
SHRAN: The information.
ARCHER: I'll bet their robes haven't been washed since the time of
Surak. Have you heard of him? Vulcan philosopher. He's the one who got
everybody to start purging their emotions. I don't know about you, but
I've learned really a lot since I got here.
(The fourth Andorian
punches him in the kidneys.)
SHRAN: What did you come to tell us?
ARCHER: Well, that depends. What do you want to know? All right,
information. Did you know that over seventy percent of the organisms on
my homeworld are bacteria.
THOLOS: What?
ARCHER: And here's something I think you'll find interesting. There was
a man in Canton, Ohio who once rolled a ball of string over six metres
in diameter.
THOLOS: He's wasting our time. Take him back.
ARCHER: There was a famous astronomer on Earth. (He drops a small statuette
through the mouth of a large carving.) ARCHER: Tycho Brahe. He lost his nose in
a duel over a math equation. (Shran knocks him down.)
SHRAN: You must enjoy pain. (Archer is dragged away.)
ARCHER: Please, please, I can't stand another
minute with the Vulcans. Please.
(Down in the catacombs, Tucker finds the dropped statuette in an
alcove.
 [Large room]
 (Tucker emerges from secret passage and throws
the statuette to Archer.)
ARCHER: A light at the end of the tunnel. You know what to do,
Commander.
TUCKER: Yes, sir. (He goes back into the passage.)
ELDER: I don't have to tell you, Captain. We don't condone these
actions you are about to take.
ARCHER: No, you don't have to tell me. Just try and stay out of the way
and everything will work out fine.
 [Transporter alcove]
 REED: Phase pistols on stun.
CREWMAN: Stun, sir?
REED: The Captain's instructions were quite explicit. It's a console,
Ensign. It won't bite.
HOSHI: No, it'll just scramble your molecules.
REED: Crewman?
CREWMAN: We've heard stories, sir. It might not be safe.
REED: I've heard the same stories. Now get up here. Coordinates set?
HOSHI: Aye, sir.
REED: Then energise before we change our minds.
 [Atrium]
 SHRAN: What is it?
KEVAL: Some kind of energy fluctuation.
 [Large room]
 (The landing party disappear into the secret
passage before the Andoriams rush in.)
SHRAN: We detected an energy surge. It came from this chamber.
T'POL: Perhaps you have faulty equipment.
SHRAN: Or perhaps you have equipment we don't know about. (to Tholos)
Watch them.
 [Catacombs]
 REED: This is it.
 [Large room]
 THOLOS: (to T'Pol) Most Vulcans smell of dust, but
you're different.
TUCKER: Something sure smells.
THOLOS: Did you say something, pink skin?
 [Atrium]
 (As Reed watches through the holes in the
carving.)
KEVAL: This can't be right. I'm detecting three new biosigns, all
human.
SHRAN: Where are they?
KEVAL: They're within twenty metres.
SHRAN: Where!
KEVAL: I can't pinpoint the signal.
SHRAN: Try boosting the proximity sensors.
 [Large room]
 THOLOS: (to T'Pol) I've heard about your mating
rituals. That Vulcan women force their men to fight each other to the
death. Would you like me to kill someone for you?
ARCHER: Leave her alone.
THOLOS: Would you like me to kill him?
 [Atrium]
 SHRAN: Find them.
KEVAL: They're very close.
(An explosion blasts the carving to pieces. Tucker tackles Tholos as
the landing party burst into the atrium, weapons firing. They take down
one Andorian, but one crewman is hurt,)
REED: Will you be all right?
CREWMAN: Go ahead. I'll cover here.
SHRAN: Keval!
(They go through the new hole in the wall.)
REED: This way.
 [Large room]
 (Reed takes out Tholos just in time.)
REED: Two of them got away. They went down into the catacombs.
ELDER: I hope you're pleased, Captain. You've turned a place of
solitude into a war zone.
ARCHER: Where are the phase pistols?
REED: Here, sir. (Archer hands one to a winded Tucker.)
ARCHER: If he wakes up, stun him again.
Let's go.
VULCAN: I'm going with you.
ELDER: Violence is no longer our way.
VULCAN: We must protect what is ours.
 [Catacombs]
 T'POL: They're down this passage. Thirty metres.
VULCAN: It leads to the reliquary. Only members of the high order are
allowed to go inside.
ARCHER: We'll do our best not to look at anything.
VULCAN: I can't permit it, Captain.
ARCHER: What would you suggest we do?
VULCAN: I'll disarm them myself.
ARCHER: You ever use one of those? I didn't think so. The Andorians
have seen your sacred relics. A couple of humans won't make much of a
difference.
 [Reliquary]
 (Well lit with large candles and wall tapers. The
two sides exchange weapons fire until a stray shot partially brings
down a tapestry and reveals a very modern circular vault door.)
REED: Captain.
(Archer makes a dash to pull the rest of the tapestry
down and opens the vault.)
ARCHER: Hold your fire. You might want to take a look at this.
(They all step into a huge hi-tech complex.)
ARCHER: I don't believe this. (to T'Pol) Does that thing have imaging
sensors?
T'POL: Yes.
ARCHER: Take all the pictures you can. (The Vulcan puts a gun to Archer's head.)
VULCAN: Place your weapons on the ground. I
will kill him if necessary. Give that to me.
(Archer turns quickly and
knocks him out.)
REED: Violence in a sanctuary, Captain?
ARCHER: Very disrespectful. Boy, did it feel good. All this time
they've been calling these monks liars, and all this time they've been
right.
REED: They've got enough equipment down there to see what any Andorian
is having for breakfast.
T'POL: I've completed my scans.
ARCHER: Give it to him.
T'POL: Sir?
ARCHER: Give it to him. (She hands the scanner to Shran.) ARCHER: You've got
what you came for. Now get out of here.
SHRAN: How do we know you won't attack our vessel.
ARCHER: The Vulcans violated your treaty. Your people ought to know
about it. (to T'Pol) You have a problem with that?
T'POL: Your communicator. (Reed hands it over.) T'POL: T'Pol to Enterprise.
TRAVIS [OC]: Go ahead.
T'POL: The Andorian ship will be leaving the surface momentarily.
They're free to go.
TRAVIS [OC]: Acknowledged.
SHRAN: We're in your debt.
ARCHER: (to Vulcan) Thanks for the tour.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Breaking The Ice
Breaking
The Ice
 Mission date: Unknown
Original Airdate: 7 Nov, 2001
  [Mess
hall]
(Tucker is looking at a child's drawing.)TUCKER: Looks like
we're going about warp four point five.
PHLOX: Human children have such fertile imaginations. Sub-commander.
TUCKER: These were sent by my nephew's fourth grade class. I thought
the crew might like to see how excited folks at home are about our
mission.
PHLOX: I'm going to put this one up in Sickbay. Would you like one for
your quarters?
T'POL: This rendering is crude, yet surprisingly accurate.
TUCKER: Some of these kids are pretty talented. Which one do you want?
This one's nice. Or maybe you want First Contact. Or how about this
one? (A picture of a green Vulcan with huge ears.)
T'POL: We're dropping out of warp.
ARCHER [OC]: For those of you who aren't near a window, you might want
to find one. There's something pretty amazing off starboard. (A comet
is gliding past.) ARCHER [OC]: Senior staff
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Please report to the Bridge.
REED: I've checked the Vulcan database, sir. No previous sightings.
HOSHI: That means we discovered it.
TRAVIS: Archer's comet.
ARCHER: Take us closer, Ensign.
TRAVIS: Aye sir.
ARCHER: Ever seen anything like that in your astronomy books?
TUCKER: Wow, that's one big snowball.
T'POL: The diameter is eighty two point six kilometres.
ARCHER: I always wanted to chase a comet. Maybe we should spend a few
days following this one.
T'POL: Vulcan and human scientists have researched hundreds of comets.
They've proven to be little more than rock and ice.
ARCHER: Except this one's bigger than any comet humans have ever seen.
That's got to be worth a look. Stay with it, Travis.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
(In her quarters, T'Pol stares at characters on a computer screen.)
 [Mess hall]
 (Tucker selects a dish from the cabinet, then
orders his drink from the dispenser.)
TUCKER: Milk, cold. (T'Pol enters.) TUCKER: Catching up on your reading?
T'POL: I came for a tea.
TUCKER: Stay away from the Zariphean blend unless you want to stay up
for the next three days.
T'POL: Caffeine has little effect on Vulcan physiology. Green tea, hot.
TUCKER: You want to join me? I could use the company.
T'POL: I'm very tired.
TUCKER: Tell me about it. I put out about a hundred fires in
Engineering this afternoon and missed dinner. Then somebody told me
Chef made a pecan pie, and suddenly my life brightened. It's been my
favourite since I was a kid. Care for a bite?
T'POL: No thank you.
TUCKER: It's delicious.
T'POL: It's mostly sugar.
TUCKER: What, Vulcans don't have a sweet tooth? It may not be good for
the body, but it sure is good for the soul. Mmm, I feel better already.
(T'Pol reads her PADD.) TUCKER: Must be a real page turner. You all right?
T'POL: I'm fine, Commander. Goodnight.
TUCKER: Sweet dreams.
 [Situation room]
 ARCHER: Eisilium?
T'POL: It's an extremely rare mineral. This comet appears to contain
large quantities of it.
ARCHER: I've never heard of eisilium.
T'POL: Vulcan chemists have only obtained small amounts. They've never
been able to study it in detail.
ARCHER: This could be your chance. Can we collect a sample with the
transporter?
T'POL: Most of the eisilium deposits are at least twenty metres beneath
the crust.
TUCKER: That's too deep to get a lock.
REED: We've got the portable drilling rig, sir.
TRAVIS: The comet's certainly big enough to land on. We could take a
shuttlepod.
T'POL: I'd advise setting down near one of the two poles. If you're out
of direct sunlight, the surface ice will be more stable.
ARCHER: How long would you need?
REED: Shouldn't take more than three or four hours.
ARCHER: You up for a little comet walk?
REED: By all means.
ARCHER: Get started.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: Captain, I'm detecting a vessel closing on
our position. It's Vulcan.
T'POL: The starship Ti'Mur.
ARCHER: Hail them. This is Captain Jonathan Archer of the Starship
Enterprise.
VANIK [on viewscreen]: I'm Captain Vanik.
ARCHER: Pleased to meet you.
VANIK [on viewscreen]: You're a long way from Earth, Captain. Are you
lost?
ARCHER: Not at all. Just taking a look at this comet.
VANIK [on viewscreen]: Our sensors detected it two days ago. We also
decided to investigate.
ARCHER: Really? My science officer tells me that Vulcans that Vulcans
aren't very interested in comets.
VANIK [on viewscreen]: Actually, it's your interest in the comet that
we're investigating.
ARCHER: We plan to send a drilling team to the surface to collect core
samples. You're welcome to participate.
VANIK [on viewscreen]: If you have no objection, we'd like to remain
here and observe.
ARCHER: Stay as long as you want. (Vanik cuts transmission.) ARCHER: T'Pol.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: I'd love to know what they're really doing
here. You don't find anything strange about them suddenly showing up?
T'POL: Perhaps they're simply curious.
ARCHER: Curious? That doesn't sound very Vulcan to me. This isn't the
first time we've caught them lurking around. Remember three weeks ago,
the planetary nebula?
T'POL: That was nothing more than a survey ship.
ARCHER: So why didn't they respond to our hails? Why'd they go to warp
when we headed toward them? I'm starting to get the feeling they're
looking over our shoulder a little too often.
T'POL: That seems unlikely.
ARCHER: We'll see. Fine. If Vanik is the kind of guy who likes to
watch, let him.
 [Shuttlepod]
 REED: I've never stood on a comet before.
TRAVIS: Has anyone?
REED: Good question.
TRAVIS: I've only seen snow twice in my life.
REED: Well, then it's only fitting that we commemorate the occasion.
TRAVIS: You mean plant a flag?
REED: No, too predictable.
TRAVIS: Snowball fight.
REED: The EV suits would take all the fun out of that. We'll just have
to see how the spirit moves us when we get there.
(They land on the comet, and stand on the ragged and pockmarked
surface. Travis has a big, big grin.)
 [Engineering]
 HOSHI: Commander, you wanted to see me?
TUCKER: Take a look at something, will you? I've been running
diagnostics and I found some kind of power surge in the transceiver
array.
HOSHI: Looks like an encrypted transmission. It came from the Vulcan
ship.
TUCKER: Who was it sent to?
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: You're sure this was sent to her quarters.
TUCKER: I wish I wasn't. Did she say anything to you about it?
ARCHER: Not a word. We had an agreement. She promised not to speak to
the Vulcans without telling me.
TUCKER: Looks like she's having some trouble keeping her promises.
Should I have Hoshi decrypt it?
ARCHER: Tell her it's top priority.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: Whenever you're ready, Captain.
TUCKER: (at Reed's station) You sure you want me here for this? I've
got a lot of work to do.
ARCHER: Stay put, Commander. This is important. Start the recording. To
the students of Miz Malvin's fourth grade class at the Worley Elementary
School in Kenmare, County Kerry, Ireland. This is Captain Archer aboard
the starship Enterprise. On behalf of the entire crew, I'd like to
thank you for your transmission. We all got a real kick out of your
drawings and letters. You asked a lot of interesting questions. I wish
we had time to answer all of them, but if we did that, we wouldn't get
much exploring done. So I've selected a few, and hopefully our answers
will give you a better idea of what life is like out here. Liam Brennan
asks 'what do you eat?' For the most part, the same things you eat at
home. Our Chef can make anything from a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich to turkey with all the trimmings. We have a hydroponic
greenhouse onboard where we grow fruits and vegetables, and we can also
replicate certain foods with our protein resequencer. Here's one from
Geoff Miles. 'Is dating allowed on Enterprise?' Well, it's not
discouraged, but there isn't a lot of privacy on a starship. Most of
our crew share quarters with at least one other person, so it wouldn't
exactly be practical. But if two crewmembers decide that they really
like each other, there are a lot of places they can go to look at the
stars. Chloe O'Shannon wants to know, 'how do we talk to aliens?' I
think I'll give that one to my Communications Officer, Ensign Hoshi
Sato.
HOSHI: Well, Chloe, that's a very good question. We use a device called
the universal translator. It's like an alien dictionary with hundreds
of languages programmed into it, and it can learn new languages very
quickly, but it doesn't always work, and when that happens it's up to
me to try to translate. I'm sure I don't have to tell you it can be
really hard sometimes. One wrong word can mean the difference between
saying 'take my hand' or 'take my life'. So far I have managed to do
pretty well.
ARCHER: Thanks, Hoshi. Here's one from Molly McCook. 'When you flush
the toilet, where does it go?' That sounds like an engineering
question, so we'll ask Commander Charles Tucker, our Chief Engineer.
Trip.
TUCKER: Pause it, will you? (Hoshi does.) TUCKER: A poop question, sir? Can't I
talk about the warp reactor or the transporter?
ARCHER: It's a perfectly valid question. (Tucker nods at Hoshi to
resume recording.)
TUCKER: The first thing you've got to understand is we recycle pretty
much everything on a starship. That includes waste, and the first thing
that happens to the waste is it gets processed through a machine called
a bio-matter resequencer. Then it gets broken down into. Hold on.
(Hoshi pauses recording.) TUCKER: They're going to think I'm the sanitation
engineer.
ARCHER: You're doing fine. (The recording is resumed.)
TUCKER: So the waste is broken down into little
molecules and then they get transformed into any number of things we
can use on the ship. Cargo containers, insulation, boots, you name it.
ARCHER: Very enlightening, Commander. Gabrielle Witty wants to know if
germs can live in space.
PHLOX: (at T'Pol's station) Ah, I believe I can answer that, Captain.
Hello, children. I'm Doctor Phlox, the ship's physician. I'm from a
system called Denobula Triaxa and I feel very honoured to be part of
this important mission. Germs. They may be tiny but they are among the
most resilient organisms known to medical science. They can survive
almost anywhere, on your kitchen counter, under your fingernail, in the
vacuum of space. Over two hundred million space-dwelling microbes have
been catalogued. One of the most virulent species lives inside grains
of interstellar dust. Polycocyx astris. They can drift in a dormant
state for millions of years and still cause a nasty cold. I once
discovered a peculiar colony of spores on the hull of a
ARCHER: Thank you, Doctor. Fascinating. I think we've taken up enough
of Miz Malvin's classroom time. By the way, we've included some pictures
of a comet we're studying. We think it might be the biggest one ever
discovered by humans or Vulcans. That's what's so exciting about being
on Enterprise. You never know what you're going to find next. We miss
Earth, but hearing from you makes us all feel a little closer to home.
Captain Archer, out. (The recording is stopped.) ARCHER: How'd it go?
 [Comet surface]
 REED: The beauty of ice is that it records
everything like a blank page. The farther down you drill, the farther
back in time you go.
TRAVIS: Lieutenant.
REED: Yes?
TRAVIS: What do you think? (He's built a snowman.)
REED: Hand me the plasma torch. (Reed gives it two eyes and a smiling mouth,
and sticks the torch in as a nose.)
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Lieutenant Reed.
REED: Go ahead, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: How are you doing, Malcolm?
REED: We're just about to set the charges.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: I'm sure I don't need to remind you we're
being observed. (The two men and the snowman are on the viewscreen.)
REED [OC]: No, sir.
ARCHER: We want this to go as smoothly as possible.
 [Comet surface]
 ARCHER [OC]: Make a good impression.
REED: Right.
ARCHER [OC]: So tell me,
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Who's the sculptor?
 [Comet surface]
 REED: It won't be there for long, sir.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Archer out.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Any luck?
HOSHI: Sorry it took so long. The code was pretty complex.
TUCKER: What's it say?
HOSHI: It's in Vulcan. You'll have to run it through the translation
matrix.
TUCKER: You didn't read it?
HOSHI: I didn't feel it'd be right.
TUCKER: Thanks. (She leaves. He goes to his console and translates it)
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in.
TUCKER: Well, we decrypted the message.
ARCHER: And?
TUCKER: It's not exactly what we expected. It's a letter.
ARCHER: What did it say?
TUCKER: It's personal.
ARCHER: What do you mean?
TUCKER: Very personal. You could order me to tell you, sir, but you
wouldn't be happy if I did.
ARCHER: Why the hell was it encrypted?
TUCKER: That's what I want to know. Maybe Vulcans encrypt all their
personal letters. All they had to do was send it through regular
channels, mark it personal, and we'd have left it alone. But no, they
had to encrypt it, force me to start snooping. I feel like I got caught
with my hand in the cookie jar.
ARCHER: Let it go, Trip. Come on, it was an honest mistake.
TUCKER: I can't let it go. I've got to tell her.
ARCHER: How's that going to help?
TUCKER: It's the right thing to do. At least I'll be able to look her
in the eye without feeling guilty.
ARCHER: You're a good man. You might want to take a phase pistol with
you.
TUCKER: I might need one.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER: Got a minute? In private?
T'POL: Excuse us, crewman. (The crewman leaves.)
TUCKER: Did you ever, did you ever do anything totally by mistake that
you weren't very proud of?
T'POL: No.
TUCKER: Did you ever come across something that you thought was one
thing so you reacted in a certain way, but then it turned out to be
something completely different?
T'POL: Your point, Commander?
TUCKER: I found out about your message from the Vulcan ship.
T'POL: It was a personal matter.
TUCKER: Why wasn't it sent through normal Starfleet channels?
T'POL: That takes time. The letter was important.
TUCKER: So they sent it in code? Do you have any idea how suspicious
that looked?
T'POL: You read my letter?
TUCKER: Believe me, I don't feel very good about it.
T'POL: I have more letters in my quarters. Would you like to read those
as well?
TUCKER: I'm trying to apologise here.
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to T'Pol.
T'POL: Yes, Captain.
ARCHER [OC]: Please report to my Ready room.
T'POL: Has anyone else read the letter?
TUCKER: No.
T'POL: I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention it.
TUCKER: I won't, I promise.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: I thought I'd invite Captain Vanik for a
visit. If he's so interested in how we do things, he might as well come
see for himself. Once he realises we're not going to blow up the
galaxy, maybe he'll leave us alone.
T'POL: I'm sure he'll appreciate the gesture.
ARCHER: Dinner's a good way to break the ice. I was hoping you might
give Chef some menu suggestions.
T'POL: Certainly.
ARCHER: A little food, a little wine.
T'POL: Vulcans don't drink wine.
ARCHER: You know what I mean. Just help me make him go away.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: When did these symptoms begin?
T'POL: Two days ago.
PHLOX: (checking her neck) Perhaps you slept in an awkward position.
T'POL: I haven't slept.
PHLOX: For two days? Something on your mind? It appears to be a tension
headache. You know anything said between us is strictly confidential.
Would you like to talk about what's troubling you?
T'POL: No.
PHLOX: I don't know if there's anyone on this ship you would feel
comfortable talking with, but if there is, it might feel good to get
whatever's bothering you out in the open. (gives her a hypo) This is a
simple analgesic. I can give you something later to help you sleep this
evening, if you'd like.
T'POL: Thank you, Doctor.
 [Comet surface]
 (The snowman has gained a large pair of pointy
ears.)
TRAVIS: The ears are a nice touch.
REED: I thought so.
TRAVIS: We should get out more often.
REED: Don't get too comfortable. This landscape is about to change.
Reed to Enterprise.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
REED: Charges are set.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Stand by. Inform the Vulcans we're about
to make a very loud noise.
HOSHI: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: Archer to Reed.
REED [OC]: Yes, Captain.
ARCHER: Blast away.
 [Comet surface]
 REED: Understood.
(They crouch down behind an ice pinnacle while the charge goes off,
then inspect the resulting crater.)
TRAVIS: Impressive.
REED: I was hoping for a little more symmetry.
TRAVIS: I'll get the drill.
 [Captain's mess]
 ARCHER: If I'm not mistaken, you're flying a Surak
class ship.
VANIK: You're not mistaken.
ARCHER: You can get her up to, what, six, six point five?
VANIK: Six point five.
TUCKER: I'd love to get a look inside those nacelles.
VANIK: Our warp systems are classified.
ARCHER: A few years back I was a guest aboard a Maymora class ship, the
Yarahla. Captain Tok. Do you know him?
VANIK: Not personally.
ARCHER: Oh. We made a run to a dark matter nebula. I helped set up the
graviton telescope. Most fun I've ever had on a space walk. Those
Vulcan EV suits are something else, like you're flying around inside
your own little starship.  (Vanik is not eating.)
VANIK:You're easily impressed.
ARCHER: Something wrong with your Pok Tar?
VANIK: No.
ARCHER: If it's not to your liking, I'm sure our Chef can prepare you
something else.
VANIK: I've already eaten.
TUCKER: Hope you saved room for dessert. (A deathly silence.)
ARCHER: After dinner, I thought you might like to take a look around.
Enterprise may not be Surak class, but she's quite a ship.
VANIK: Perhaps another time.
ARCHER: Tea?
VANIK: I only drink water.
ARCHER: You know, for people who claim not to be explorers, you sure do
get around.
VANIK: I hope our presence here is not proving inconvenient.
ARCHER: On the contrary, it's nice to know no matter how big the
universe is, there's always a Vulcan ship nearby.
TUCKER: So, Captain, tell us about yourself.
VANIK: Excuse me?
T'POL: On Earth, it's customary to exchange personal information with
someone you've just met.
ARCHER: We have this peculiar habit of actually talking during meals.
VANIK: I've noticed. What would you like to know?
TUCKER: I don't know. Where were you born, how long have you been
Captain, any hobbies?
VANIK: I've served in the Vulcan space programme for seventy six years,
fifteen of them commanding the Ti'Mur.
T'POL: I believe this is Captain Vanik's first visit aboard an Earth
vessel.
ARCHER: We'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.
VANIK: I have none. Humans have never held much interest for me.
ARCHER: Well, where did the time go? Seems like you just got here. I'm
sure you're eager to get back to your ship so I'll trouble you with
just one last question. (stands) How long to you plan on spying on us?
VANIK: If we were spying, Captain, you would have never detected our
presence. Your inexperience and your arrogance are your enemies, not
us. Archer (opens the door, and a security officer enters.)
ARCHER: Please show Captain Vanik
to the launch bay.
VANIK: Shanshot tumora camosh. (He leaves.)
TUCKER: What'd he say? (T'Pol leaves.)
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: Captain, you should take a look at this.
(An image of the comet rotating.)
 [Comet surface]
 (The drilling rig is set up and busy.)
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Lieutenant Reed.
REED: Go ahead, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: How's it going?
REED: We hit a layer of magnesite and cracked a drill bit, but we've
replaced it.
ARCHER [OC]: You may want to pick up the pace a little bit.
REED: Sir?
ARCHER [OC]: The comet's rotational axis shifted when you set off those
charges. In about two hours the shuttlepod will be facing the star.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: The temperature's going to shoot up by a
couple of hundred degrees. I want you out of there before then.
 [Comet surface]
 REED: We'll be done with time to spare, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: Be sure you are. Archer out.
 [T'Pol's quarters]
(T'Pol is sitting on the floor, meditating with candles.)  T'POL: Come in.
TUCKER: You decide to tell me what Vanik said?
T'POL: Please, sit down.
TUCKER: I've never seen your quarters before. Cozy. (Tucker sits on floor.) TUCKER: You
know you're not supposed to have an open flame on the ship.
T'POL: I was given permission from the Captain. They're for meditation.
TUCKER: So, what can I do for you?
T'POL: Doctor Phlox believes that it might help if I was to discuss my
problem with someone I felt comfortable confiding in.
TUCKER: You want to talk to me? Well, I'm not sure I'm going to be much
help. I mean, I've only been in three relationships and they all went
bust. Are you sure you wouldn't rather talk to Hoshi or Ensign Kimball?
She's married.
T'POL: You were far from my first choice, but speaking with someone
else would mean more people knowing about my situation.
TUCKER: I'll do anything I can. What's your problem?
T'POL: You read the letter.
TUCKER: Yes.
T'POL: Then you know that unless I leave Enterprise immediately, my
wedding plans will be cancelled.
TUCKER: Have you talked to?
T'POL: Koss.
TUCKER: Have you talked to Koss about all this?
T'POL: We haven't spoken in many years. Marriages on Vulcan are
arranged during childhood. I've only met Koss four times.
TUCKER: How can you be in love with a guy you've only met four times?
T'POL: It's assumed that we'd eventually develop an affection for one
another.
TUCKER: So his parents send you an ultimatum? He doesn't have a say?
T'POL: His parents planned the union. It's their decision.
TUCKER: Boy. Where I come from, arranged marriages went out with
slavery.
T'POL: Are you going to give me advice or criticize my people's
tradition.
TUCKER: I'm still a little fuzzy on why they threatened to call it off
in the first place.
T'POL: The ceremony was supposed to take place next week. When I
decided to remain on Enterprise I requested a postponement. Koss's
parents were insulted that I would put off our plans to serve on a
human vessel.
TUCKER: Well, Vanik can take you home. Why don't you go marry Koss,
then come back?
T'POL: It's customary for a husband and wife to reside together for at
least one Vulcan year.
TUCKER: Maybe he can come to Enterprise.
T'POL: He's an architect. It would be illogical for him to live aboard
a starship.
TUCKER: This whole thing sounds illogical.
T'POL: Your advice, Commander.
TUCKER: What do you want to do?
T'POL: That is irrelevant.
TUCKER: No, it's not. It's very relevant. Do you want to go back and
marry this guy, spend a year with him, ten years, a hundred years, or
do you want to stay on Enterprise?
T'POL: I have an obligation.
TUCKER: You've got an obligation to yourself. You've spent the last
year around humans. If there's one thing you should have learned it's
that we're free to make our own decisions. There's a lot to be said for
personal choice.
T'POL: If you'd spent the last year on Vulcan, you would have learned
that our commitment to tradition outweighs personal choice.
TUCKER: I respect your customs, but this marriage was arranged when you
were a kid. A lot's happened since then. People change.
T'POL: Vulcan's don't.
TUCKER: Really.
T'POL: My obligation is to my culture, my heritage. It has to take
precedence.
TUCKER: Sounds to me like you already made up your mind. Why the hell
did you ask me here?
T'POL: It was a mistake. I apologise. (T'Pol stands. Tucker goes to leave.)
TUCKER: Did it ever occur to you that you might have
postponed the wedding because subconsciously you wanted to get out of
it?
T'POL: That would imply that my subconscious mind controls my
decisions. It doesn't.
TUCKER: Well it happens to humans all the time. Maybe you're picking up
some of our bad habits.
 [Comet surface]
 (They're packing up to leave when Travis slips and
falls back into the crater they blew.)
REED: Travis! (Reed goes down to him.)
TRAVIS: I'm okay. Ah!
REED: What?
TRAVIS: My knee.
REED: You rest here.
TRAVIS: I'm all right.
REED: Okay. (Reed helps him up.) REED: Well, let's get you to the pod. I'll come
back for the gear if there's time.
TRAVIS: At least take the core sample. We shouldn't go back to the ship
empty-handed.
(A white dawn is looming below the horizon.)
REED: Almost there.
TRAVIS: It might be faster without the suits.
REED: Yes, and a lot colder.
(The sun has risen. There's a cracking sound.)
REED: What's that? (They look down to see a network of cracks appearing
in the ice in front of them. As they approach the pod, the cracks start
to become crevasses,)
TRAVIS: I hope I never see snow again. (They climb aboard the shuttlepod.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 (Whilst trying to lift off, alarms bleeping, the pod
falls through the weakened surface ice.)
REED: You all right?
TRAVIS: We should have never ignited the thrusters.
REED: Well, it's not like we had a choice. (He sees they have an incoming
transmission.)Reed here.
ARCHER [OC]: You two okay?
REED: More or less. How far did we drop?
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: About eighteen metres. We'll get you out
of there.
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER [OC]: Just give us a few minutes.
REED: We're not going anywhere.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Bring the grappler online.
TUCKER: (at Reed's station) The mouth of that chasm's a little narrow.
ARCHER: I'll get you in close enough. (Archer takes over the helm and flies
low over the comet.) ARCHER: Do you see them?
TUCKER: Bring us in another fifty metres. Two metres starboard. A
little more.
HOSHI: The Vulcan ship's hailing us.
ARCHER: Take a message, I'm busy.
HOSHI: Captain Vanik wants to know if we require assistance.
ARCHER: Tell him we've got everything under control.
TUCKER: There, right there. Synchronise to the rotation. Almost got it.
(He fires the two grapplers, but only one hits the pod.) TUCKER: One hit, one miss.
ARCHER: One'll be fine. Reel them in.
TUCKER: The pod's hit an outcropping. It's wedged in. Take us a few
metres to port. We might be able to pull them around it. Those eisilium
deposits are disrupting the maglock. I'm losing them.
ARCHER: Ease them back down. (The grapple gives way and the pod lands
again with a thump.)
T'POL: They've fallen another nine metres.
ARCHER: Let's try it again.
T'POL: Captain, they're moving out of the sunlight. The surface ice is
recrystallising.
TUCKER: In less than an hour that chasm will be sealed up again.
ARCHER: Then we'd better hurry.
T'POL: There is another option. Captain Vanik.
ARCHER: I'd rather leave him out of this.
T'POL: His ship has a tractor beam that won't be affected by the
eisilium.
ARCHER: Reset the grappler.
T'POL: Vanik offered to assist us. There's no shame in accepting.
ARCHER: We can do this on our own.
TUCKER: I don't like him any more than you do, Captain, but a tractor
beam sounds like a pretty good idea right now.
T'POL: Vanik expects you to refuse his offer. He sees humans as
arrogant, prideful. Why not prove him wrong? You can save them, or you
can let your pride stand in the way. You're human. You're free to
choose.
 [Shuttlepod]
 (There's a big jolt.)
TRAVIS: They've got us.
REED: Go ahead, Enterprise.
VANIK [OC]: This is Captain Vanik of the Vulcan ship Ti'Mur. Stand by
to ignite your engines and return to your ship.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: I thought you might want to take a look at
the data we collected. You helped us bring it back, it's the least we
can do.
VANIK [on viewscreen]: As your science officer told you, we have little
interest in comets.
TUCKER: That tractor beam of yours is quite something. Any chance we
could take a look at the specifications?
VANIK [on viewscreen]: That information is classified.
TUCKER: I thought it might be.
VANIK [on viewscreen]: We'll be leaving within the hour. Is there
anything else we can help you with?
ARCHER: You've done more than enough. See you around. (transmission
ends)
TUCKER: You don't have much time. I assume you're all packed.
T'POL: Captain, with your permission, I'd like to transmit a message to
the Ti'Mur, to send to Vulcan.
ARCHER: Go right ahead.
T'POL: Thank you. (T'Pol leaves.)
ARCHER: What was that all about?
TUCKER: It's personal.
(Later, in her quarters, T'Pol is meditating, with a piece of pie on a
plate in front of her.)

  [Situation
room]
 ARCHER: Morning everyone.
ALL: Morning, sir.
ARCHER: What have we got today?
T'POL: We've detected several phenomenon. A J'ral class supernova
remnant approximately three light years off our course.
ARCHER: That's interesting. What else?
T'POL: A cluster of three neutron stars. Very unusual.
TUCKER: How about that, three stone-cold stars. Pretty exciting, huh?
ARCHER: Anything else?
TUCKER: There is one other thing that might be worth swinging by to
take a look. A Minshara class planet about four and a half light years
away. (A blue green globe is put up on the monitor.)
ARCHER: Any life signs?
TUCKER: Only about five hundred million. If our scans are right, it
looks like there's a whole civilisation down there. (Archer turns to T'Pol, the only one not grinning.)
ARCHER: You might have put that
on the top of the list.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Put us into orbit at five hundred
kilometres.
REED: I'm not picking up any other ships or satellites.
TRAVIS: Should we hail them?
HOSHI: Who? I'm picking up dozens of cities on each continent.
ARCHER: Let's hold off a second. We don't know whether they're using
high-band frequencies or smoke signals.
T'POL: The latter's more likely. I'm not detecting any EM
transmissions.
TUCKER: Pre-industrial?
ARCHER: Let's take a closer look. (An aerial view of a coastal town.) ARCHER: Do
you see that, just off the coast.
HOSHI: I've got it. (They zoom in on a three masted ship.)
TUCKER: Looks like an old clipper ship.
ARCHER: It's almost like travelling back in time.
TUCKER: I cannot wait to get down there.
T'POL: I'd advise against that. It's standard protocol to wait until a
society develops warp drive before initiating first contact.
TUCKER: Those are Vulcan protocols, not human.
T'POL: Starfleet would be wise to adopt them. There's no way to know
how our arrival would affect the evolution of their society.
TUCKER: So what are you suggesting we do?
T'POL: Our sensors can gather a great deal of data from orbit.
ARCHER: Give me a tighter view of the city, Hoshi. (She zooms in to show
people in a narrow street.) ARCHER: Can you get tight enough to see their faces?
(A couple talking, a woman turns her head.) ARCHER: Freeze that. They
don't look so different. What do you think, Trip?
TUCKER: I think you're right, Captain.
T'POL: You'd be recognised immediately as outsiders.
ARCHER: Not if we look like them. Starfleet could've sent a probe out
here to make maps and take pictures, but they didn't. They sent us so
we could explore with our own senses.
(Later, Hoshi is listening to something and quietly laughing)
ARCHER: You okay?
HOSHI: The acoustic relay is picking up dozens of languages. I could
spend the next ten years studying this place.
ARCHER: Well, let's hear some of it. (A medley of russian and eastern
european sounding words.)
HOSHI: It'll take a while to work out a translation matrix for all of
them. We'll be able to narrow it down for you once we pick a landing
site. I did find the one word you might want to remember. Akaali. It's
the name of their species.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: A farm?
T'POL: It's remote and sparsely populated. If you're exposed, there's a
reduced risk of cultural contamination.
ARCHER: This must be why aliens are always landing in cornfields. So,
who do we send first?
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: It should stand up to scrutiny as long as
you don't look too close. Here, see for yourself. (He holds a mirror up
for Hoshi to see her Akaali forehead ridges in place.)
HOSHI: It itches.
PHLOX: You mustn't touch it, Ensign. The irritation will subside.
HOSHI: Are you sure I'm the right person for this?
ARCHER: If the translator goes down, you'll be able to handle yourself
better than any of us.
PHLOX: The anterior crests aren't quite symmetrical. I'll just add a
little more definition to the right side.
ARCHER: We don't need it to be too perfect.
PHLOX: Of course, Captain.
T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: Please report to the Bridge.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Is there a problem?
T'POL: I'm detecting neutrino emissions from a city on the eastern
continent.
ARCHER: What's causing it?
T'POL: Possibly an antimatter reactor.
TUCKER: These people don't even have indoor plumbing.
HOSHI: Maybe some of them are more advanced than others.
ARCHER: Or maybe we're not the first visitors. What about
non-indigenous biosigns?
T'POL: I'm not reading any, but at this range it's hard to be certain.
ARCHER: Trip, T'Pol, let's head down to Sickbay. (to Hoshi) Let the
quartermaster know we'll need three more sets of clothing.
 [Shuttlepod}
 (The crew are in Italian renaissance era style
clothes)
TUCKER: My feet would be a lot happier in my own boots.
ARCHER: What's this?
HOSHI: Identification papers. Everyone in the city has to carry them.
TUCKER: T'Pol. (He gestures to her to cover her ear tips with the long wig. The pod lands outside the city at night.)
 [City street]
 (T'Pol takes scans while Hoshi watches their back.
She catches a man watching them.)
HOSHI: T'Pol. (They move on. Elsewhere, the men are doing the same.)
ARCHER: Over here.
TUCKER: I've got it too. The reactor's about eight metres under this
building.
ARCHER: Looks like some kind of curio shop. (They try the door, but
it's locked.) ARCHER: I guess we'll have to wait until morning.
TUCKER: There could be a lot more people around then. It might be
easier to get a look at this thing tonight.
ARCHER: Except we're on the wrong side of this door.
TUCKER: Not for long. (He produces a lock-pick.)
ARCHER: Seventy eight light years to get here, our first act is
breaking and entering.
TUCKER: Maybe you don't have to mention this part in your log? (Their
actions are not going unobserved, then Archer spots a shadow.)
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: Going as fast as I can. (They're in before the pedestrian can
see them.)
 [Shop]
 (There are glass jugs, a long case clock, an
assortment of stuff.)
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol.
T'POL [OC]: Go ahead, Captain.
ARCHER: I think we found what we're looking for.
T'POL: Acknowledged. We'll meet at your coordinates.
TUCKER: Back here. (As they go through curtains to the back of the
building, the person who was watching them enters the shop - a woman.)
TUCKER: The neutrino emissions are off the meter. It's got to be
through here.
(Archer reaches for the door handle, and a force field flares blue. The
woman is startled.)
TUCKER: It's some kind of magnetic barrier.
ARCHER: Can you disable it?
TUCKER: I'll try. (The woman cocks a hand-crossbow and confronts them.)
RIANN: Who are you? What did you do to that door?
TUCKER: Nothing, honest.
RIANN: I want to know what you're doing here.
ARCHER: You don't need to point that weapon at us. We're collectors.
We're picking up an antique.
RIANN: A real collector would've waited until the shop was open. You're
not here to pick up any antiques. I've been watching the shop for
weeks. I know all about your evening deliveries.
ARCHER: Deliveries?
RIANN: People are getting sick. Some are even dying because of what's
going on in here. Did you know that? Move away from the door.
(T'Pol has arrived and stuns her from behind.)
ARCHER: Was that necessary?
T'POL: She was armed.
ARCHER: Let's try not to shoot anyone else while we're here, okay?
T'POL: I'll try.
ARCHER: The reactor signature's coming from the other side of that
door, but it's protected by some kind of energy field.
T'POL: We should go. It'll be dawn soon.
TUCKER: What about her? We can't just leave her here.
ARCHER: Hoshi. (He hands over ID papers to her to translate.)
HOSHI: Her name's Riann, she's an apothecary.
ARCHER: I'll meet you back at the shuttle.
 [Riann's attic]
 RIANN: (waking suddenly) What did you do to me?
ARCHER: Nothing. You just collapsed.
RIANN: That's the second lie you've told me. You're not very good at
it. Why did you bring me back here. Did Garos tell you to? Are you
working for him?
ARCHER: Garos?
RIANN: You don't know who I'm talking about. He owns the shop you broke
into.
ARCHER: I'm not working for anyone. I just wanted to make sure you got
home all right.
RIANN: Wait. If you don't work for him, what were you doing in there?
ARCHER: There's something strange going on in that shop. I don't know
what, exactly, but I'm trying to figure it out. I'm an investigator
from another city.
RIANN: Which city? Who sent you?
ARCHER: I can't tell you anymore than that, not right now.
RIANN: I suppose telling me nothing is better than another lie.
ARCHER: My colleague's waiting for me. I've got to go. You said
something about a sickness. I wanted to come back tomorrow and talk to
you about it. Will you be here? (She nods, he goes to leave.)
RIANN: You didn't tell me your name.
ARCHER: Jon.
RIANN: Jon. How far away is this city?
 [Bridge]
 REED: Even if we flatten the building with a
torpedo barrage, it probably wouldn't make a dent in that energy field.
ARCHER [OC]: What about the shop itself, can you scan underneath it?
REED: That's strange. Sensors aren't
 [Shuttlepod]
 REED [OC]: Picking up anything under the shop. No
basement, no bedrock. It's like the building's sitting on nothing at
all.
TUCKER: There must be some kind of dampening field in place.
ARCHER: Keep you sensors locked on that shop. If you notice anything
else out of the ordinary, let me know right away.
REED [OC]: Understood.
ARCHER: That woman, Riann, said something about people getting sick.
HOSHI: I think we may have seen some of them. Mottled skin, lesions on
their faces.
TUCKER: If we can get one of these people to the ship, Doctor Phlox
might be able to tell us what's wrong with them.
T'POL: I'd advise against that. If I'm not mistake, the fear of alien
abduction caused a great deal of apprehension on your planet for
centuries. Perhaps we should talk to the shopkeeper first.
 [Shop]
 (Daylight. A man is gluing a wing back onto a
figurine, a woman is browsing.)
GAROS: Welcome, gentlemen. If I don't have what you're looking for, I'm
certain I can find someone who does. Can I help you?
ARCHER: We noticed antiques in the window. My friend here is an amateur
collector.
GAROS: Were you looking for something in particular?
TUCKER: These are interesting.
GAROS: You won't find a more varied collection in the entire city. This
is the pride of my entire collection. (takes a mask off the wall)
TUCKER: Who's it supposed to be?
GAROS: Draylan, the mythical ruler of the afterworld. (Archer is taking
secret scans.) GAROS: You're not from this province, are you?
ARCHER: No, and neither are you. Your DNA doesn't match any other
lifeform on this planet. (Garos activates his own scanner.)
GAROS: Nor does yours. I see why you have
a fondness for masks. Who are you?
ARCHER: I'm Captain Jonathan Archer of the Starship Enterprise. We're
explorers from the planet Earth.
GAROS: Earth? I never heard of it. How did you know I was here?
TUCKER: We picked up the signature from your reactor.
ARCHER: Now that you know who we are, maybe you could tell us what
you're doing here.
GAROS: I'm an explorer as well. At least, I used to be. I'm from the
Malurian system. Two years ago I led a survey mission to study the
Akaali. We had no plans to remain here, but after a few months I found
myself quite taken with these people, so I decided to stay.
ARCHER: If you enjoy the simple life so much, why do you have an
antimatter reactor in your basement?
GAROS: There's nothing nefarious about it, I assure you. The reactor
powers a fabrication device. It allows me to make food and clothing.
ARCHER: I don't know if you've heard, but there's an illness spreading
through this area. Some people seem to think you're the cause of it.
GAROS: I see you've met our apothecary.
ARCHER: You know her?
GAROS: She's been making baseless accusations against me for months.
There's a lethal virus spreading among the Akaali, but it's indigenous.
I certainly didn't bring it here. Unfortunately these people don't have
the medical technology to cure it, so this woman blames the newcomer,
me.
ARCHER: If you wouldn't mind, we'd like to take a look at this reactor
of yours. (The shop door opens.)
GAROS: Perhaps some other time, Captain. Excuse me. Welcome. If I don't
have what you're looking for I'm certain I can find someone who does.
Gentlemen. (opens door for them to leave)
 [Side street]
 ARCHER: His reactor's got an awful lot of power
for a fabrication device.
TUCKER: He could probably feed and clothe half the continent with it.
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol.
T'POL [OC}: Go ahead.
ARCHER: How soon can you meet us?
 [Riann's attic]
 (She's studying a book. There's a knock.)
RIANN: Yes.
ARCHER: Hello again.
RIANN: Hello. Who's your friend?
ARCHER: Her name's T'Pol. She's helping me investigate Garos's shop.
You two have something in common. T'Pol is a scientist as well. (T'Pol looks at bench of glass vials.)
T'POL: Your facility's impressive.
Would you mind?
RIANN: If you're careful not to touch anything. You two are from the
same province?
ARCHER: Not exactly.
RIANN: Must be difficult to make friends when you keep so much to
yourself.
ARCHER: I'm sorry, I don't mean to be evasive.
RIANN: Yes, you do. (T'Pol scans shelves of bottles.) RIANN: Turn down that
flame, please.
ARCHER: I was hoping you could tell us a little bit more about this
illness.
RIANN: Why don't you tell me why you were in Garos's shop.
ARCHER: We were trying to get into the basement. We think there's some
kind of machine there, something he's not supposed to have.
RIANN: What kind of machine?
ARCHER: We're not sure, but it may be indirectly connected to this
epidemic. If you can tell us what you know, we might be able to help.
RIANN: I can't tell you much. People are dying and I can't determine
why. Drop this in the water, carefully. I learned of the epidemic about
eighteen months ago. My brother was one of the first victims.
ARCHER: I'm sorry.
RIANN: At first I thought it was some kind of airborne contagion, but
it never spread beyond this part of the city. I'm sampled the soil, the
water, I can't find anything out of the ordinary. (T'Pol dips litmus
paper into a vial)
ARCHER: Why do you believe this Garos is involved?
RIANN: The first cases occurred here (She goes over to a map on wall.) RIANN: A few
hundred metres from his shop. That was just one month after he arrived.
ARCHER: You said something about evening deliveries.
RIANN: Every few nights, someone carries crates from his shop to
different places outside the city. When I've gone back in the morning,
crates are gone. Hand me that.
ARCHER: That's why you were watching his shop. You thought we were
there for the crates. (Riann pours some liquid from the vial he put the
perforated ball into.)
RIANN: Tea. Would you like some?
T'POL: Jon, may I speak with you?
ARCHER: I'd love a cup. (He and T'Pol go over to the doorway.) ARCHER: Did you
get what you need?
T'POL: I should return to the ship and begin my analysis.
ARCHER: All right, you and the others head back.
T'POL: What about you?
ARCHER: I'll stay here, see if I can earn more about Garos and these
shipments.
T'POL: The longer you remain, the more you risk cultural contamination.
ARCHER: These people are suffering from something a lot worse than
cultural contamination. We've got to find out what it is.
T'POL: Enjoy your tea. 
 [Sickbay]
 (T'Pol's scans of Riann's books are on the
monitor. She is back to her normal appearance.)
PHLOX: Quite impressive. Did you say this is a pre-industrial society?
T'POL: Yes.
PHLOX: Her methods may be unrefined, but this woman is using forensic
techniques far more sophisticated than I would've expected. Isn't it
extraordinary? Thousands of sentient species in our little corner of
the cosmos, each one discovering science in their own unique way.
(He takes T'Pol's litmus paper for analysis.) PHLOX: Had this woman been born on
Vulcan or Earth I'm sure she would have made a fine physician. Here's
our culprit. The water sample's contaminated with tetracyanate 622.
T'POL: I'm not familiar with it.
PHLOX: It's a synthetic compound primarily used as an industrial
lubricant, usually under the strictest safety protocols. It's quite
toxic.
T'POL: Could this be responsible for the epidemic?
PHLOX: If it's managed to seep into the ground water, absolutely.
T'POL: I'll notify the Captain.
 [Street across from Garos's shop]
(Riann is making notes in a book.)  RIANN: Samples from three
new subjects indicate no
ARCHER: Did you say something?
RIANN: Sorry. I mutter when I'm writing sometimes. It's an old habit.
ARCHER: I have a similar one. I talk to my dog.
RIANN: My mother bought me a tousorobco once, but it tuployo pludak.
ARCHER: What was that?
(Riann speaks in Akaali, so Archer kisses her to shut her up while he adjusts
the translator. It doesn't work first time, so he kisses her again.)
ARCHER: Are you all right?
RIANN: All right? I'm all right.
ARCHER: Someone was walking this way, but he turned and went around the
corner. I thought if we pretended to be
RIANN: I understand. (The shop door opens and a man loads three crates
onto a hand cart then wheels it away. They follow.)
 [Forest]
 (As Archer and Riann watch, he unloads the crates
then talks into a device similar to Garos's scanner and finally leaves.)
ARCHER: I want you to head back.
RIANN: Not before I see what's in those crates. Help me open this.
(A bright light appears from above them and they dash for cover.)
ARCHER: Move! (They watch from behind a shrub as a small ship comes
down and tractors the crates up before heading into space again.)
RIANN: Have you ever seen anything like that?
ARCHER: Actually, I have. (A phaser-type beam hits a tree near them.
Archer gets his phase pistol out.) ARCHER: Stay here. (He circles around to find
their attacker.)
RIANN: Jon! (The man is above him in a tree fork. Archer pulls him down and
they fight on the ground. Finally Archer knocks him out, then peels off
his latex mast to reveal a scaly face. Both scrabble for the phase
pistol, Archer gets there first and stuns him.)
ARCHER: It's all right. He's not dead. (He takes the alien's equipment.)
RIANN: Is there anything else you'd like to tell me, Jon?
 [Garos's shop]
 RIANN: If your ship can travel to so many stars
then why would you come here?
ARCHER: To meet you.
RIANN: Me?
ARCHER: Not you personally, but your people.
RIANN: Why? We're so backward compared to you.
ARCHER: If you take away our technology we're not that different. (He uses
one of the devices to deactivate the door forcefield.) ARCHER: Come on.(In the basement - through a window they can see a cavern with other
people and machinery.)
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: They're mining some kind of veridium
isotope.
T'POL: Veridium is primarily used to manufacture explosives.
ARCHER [OC]: I'm not surprised.
T'POL: Did you find any traces of tetracyanate?
 [Garos's shop]
 ARCHER: Their drill bits are saturated with it.
We've got to shut this all down. The reactor seems to be powering the
entire operation but I can't use my phase-pistol. I'd risk blowing up
half the city.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER: Captain, let me come down there and take a
crack at it.
 [Garos's shop]
 ARCHER: I doubt that we have that much time. Our
best shot is the transporter. I'll see what I can do about disengaging
that dampening field. Give me a few minutes.
T'POL [OC]: Understood.
 [Reactor chamber]
 ARCHER: I don't suppose you read Malurian.
RIANN: Can't you use your device?
ARCHER: It wasn't designed for that.
RIANN: What are we looking for?
ARCHER: There's an energy field surrounding the shop. It's keeping my
ship from seeing what's in here. One of these controls should turn it
off. (Riann points to another display.)
RIANN: Here. This is Tengala Street. Here's
the shop. This outline could have something to do with the energy
field. Wait, what are you doing?
ARCHER: If the blue line represents the dampening field, this blue
button should control it.
RIANN: What about the yellow dots?
ARCHER: What about them?
RIANN: How do we know they don't represent the field? Maybe it's the
yellow button.
ARCHER: The blue one's lit.
RIANN: That's what worries me.
ARCHER: We could debate this all day. Blue or yellow?
RIANN: Blue. (Archer presses it, an alarm sounds and all the doors
shot.)
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: There's a ship approaching.
T'POL: From where?
TRAVIS: It must have been in a geosynchonous orbit on the other side of
the planet.
REED: I'm picking up multiple weapon platforms. They're armed to the
teeth.
HOSHI: We're being hailed from the surface.
T'POL: The Captain?
HOSHI: I don't think so.
T'POL: On screen.
GAROS [on viewscreen]: I suggest you leave this system at once or my
ship will open fire.
T'POL: I want to speak with Captain Archer.
GAROS [on viewscreen]: That won't be possible. He's dead.
REED: The ship's firing. (Whumph!)
GAROS [on viewscreen]: My vessel is capable of firing ten of those
charges simultaneously. Again, I suggest you break orbit.
 [Reactor room]
(Outside the window.)  GAROS: How did you learn about
this facility, Captain? Was it from a somewhat ugly Tellarite merchant
perhaps?
ARCHER: I told you. We detected your reactor from orbit.
GAROS: I forgot. You're explorers.
ARCHER: We're trying to help these people. What you're doing here is
contaminating their water supply.
GAROS: There are five hundred million Akaali on this planet. A few
thousand won't be missed. I'm willing to let you go, provided you
promise not to return. We've instructed your ship to send down a launch
vehicle to take you and the woman.
ARCHER: She belongs here.
GAROS: Believe me, she'll be better off on your ship. Now step away
from the control panel, Captain. (Archer gives his phase pistol to Riann.)
ARCHER: If anyone walks through
either of these doors, aim this and pull the trigger.
 [Bridge]
 REED: They're recharging weapons.
T'POL: Prepare to leave orbit on my order.
TUCKER: Belay that! Keep this ship right where it is.
T'POL: I don't have to reiterate that I outrank you, Mister Tucker.
Ensign.
CREWMAN [OC]: Engineering.
TUCKER: Billy, stand by to vent the nacelles on my order.
CREWMAN [OC]: Yes, sir.
TUCKER: We're not going anywhere.
T'POL: I didn't say leave orbit, I said prepare to leave orbit. I have
no intention of abandoning the Captain, dead or alive.(Down in the reactor room, the power is cut and both doors open. Riann and
Archer leave.)
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: The dampening field's down.
TUCKER: Anything?
REED: I've got a fix on it.
TUCKER: Transfer the coordinates. (He leaves. The ship is hit again.)
REED: The forward hull plating's depolarising.
T'POL: Evasive manoeuvres. Keep us within transporter range.
TRAVIS: I'll try.
T'POL: Return fire. (Two torpedoes hit the alien's shields.)
REED: They've got some kind of energy shielding. Our weapons are
ineffective.
HOSHI: It's the Captain.
T'POL: Put him through.
 [Street]
 ARCHER: How's it going up there?
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: A Malurian vessel's opened fire. We're
taking damage.
 [Street]
 ARCHER: And the reactor?
T'POL: We're trying to get a lock on it now.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Are you all right? He said you'd been
killed.
 [Street]
 ARCHER: Don't worry about me, just get the
reactor.
RIANN: Jon. (Garos is nearby, looking for them.)
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: We've lost lateral thrusters.
T'POL: Commander Tucker, status.
 [Transporter alcove]
 TUCKER: This'd be a lot easier if you'd stop
rocking the boat.
T'POL [OC]: How long?
TUCKER: I've almost got a lock.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: I can't shake them.
HOSHI: Even if we get the reactor, how are we going to keep them from
taking it back?
T'POL: If they want it so badly, maybe we should give it to them. (Down in the street, Garos's henchman spots them and opens fire with
his weapon. Archer and Riann duck behind a stone trough. Garos is
attracted by the commotion. Archer takes out the henchman then goes
around the trough to hide from Garos and another gunman.)
 [Transporter alcove]
 TUCKER: I've got a lock.
 [Bridge]
 REED: (Starboard tube's loaded.
T'POL: Stand by to go to full impulse. Now, Commander.
(The reactor is beamed into the alcove then straight out again into the
path of the Malurian ship.)
T'POL: Fire. (The torpedo detonates the reactor as the Malurians arrive
on top of it. Satisfying green ripples.)
REED: Their shielding is down.
T'POL: Come about, Ensign. Target their weapons array.
 [Street]
 RIANN: The oil lamp. (A form of street lighting.)
ARCHER: What about it?
RIANN: There should be at least a litre of residic oil in the container
below it. Residic oil ignites at three hundred and ninety eight
degrees. You wouldn't happen to have anything that gets that hot?
(Archer dodges to the shelter of a building and adjusts his phase
pistol then fires. The lamp behind Garos and his friend explodes,
sending them flying and knocking them out momentarily.)
ARCHER: Archer.
T'POL [OC]: The reactor's been destroyed, Captain. We've disarmed the
Malurian ship. Should we disable their engines?
ARCHER: No. They're about to leave, but first they need to pick up
three passengers. Archer out. I don't think you're going to have time
to pack up your shop. (He gives Garos his gun back. Garos actives a
transporter and the three swirl out of view.)
 Captain's starlog, July 31st, 2151. We've removed
the mining equipment from under the shop. As far as we can tell, none
of the Akaali knows what really happened, with one exception.
 {Riann's attic]
(Archer handa over bottle of liquid.)  ARCHER: Tell them
to take the entire dose.
RIANN: Just one?
ARCHER: That's all they'll need.
RIANN: What if Garos comes back?
ARCHER: I've notified T'Pol's people. They're going to look in on you
from time to time.
RIANN: They could stop by for tea.
ARCHER: You bet. It's probably best if you keep all this to yourself. (She puta the bottle in case with others.)
RIANN: Who'd believe me anyway?
Where is your starship headed now?
ARCHER: There are lots of inhabited planets to see, but I doubt many
will be this memorable. (He kisses her.)
RIANN: Is your translator broken again?
ARCHER: I'm sorry? I don't understand a word you're saying. (And kisses her
again, with passion.)

 Original Airdate: 21 Nov, 2001
  [Cargo
Module 4]
 (Two men are throwing an oval ball between each
other in the reduced gravity.)
KEENE: Hauled down in the corner of the end zone. Touchdown!
RYAN: Like to see you make that catch with the gravity plating at Earth
sea level.
KEENE: I doubt you could throw the ball ten metres on Earth.
RYAN: One more reason not to go.
KEENE: Did you find out what was causing that vibration in module two?
RYAN: The cargo handlers at Jupiter Station. They didn't balance the
load. Shaw and I, we, er, we trimmed it out.
KEENE: Keep an eye on it. (There's a judder.)
VOICE [OC]: Bridge to Captain Keene. We're under attack, sir. It's the
Nausicaans.
KEENE: Drop out of warp. Charge the plasma cannon. (Another hit and we
see the alien ship strafing the cargo hauler.)
 [Archer's quarters]
(Archer is woken by the comm. signal.)  ARCHER: Archer.
CREWMAN [OC]: Sorry to disturb you sir, but I have an incoming
transmission from Starfleet Command. It's Admiral Forrest.
ARCHER: Put him through.
CREWMAN [OC]: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: Admiral. Good to see you.
FORREST [on monitor]: You too, Jon, what I can make out.
ARCHER: We're getting ready to deploy the first subspace amplifier.
Should clear up reception a bit.
FORREST [on monitor]: Whatever you have to do to keep those reports
coming. The scans of that comet were incredible.
ARCHER: Something tells me you didn't call at four in the morning to
talk about comets.
FORREST [on monitor]: I hate to do this to you Jon, but we're turning
you around.
ARCHER: Sir?
FORREST [on monitor]: We picked up an automated distress signal from a
cargo freighter, the ECS Fortunate. The nearest Starfleet vessel is
three weeks away at its maximum warp, but you could be there in a day
and a half.
ARCHER: What's the problem?
FORREST [on monitor]: We're not sure. They're not responding to hails.
I'd like you to check this out. Give them any assistance they need.
ARCHER: We're on our way.
FORREST [on monitor]: Forrest out.
ARCHER: I think our day's going to start a little early. (Porthos wags
his tail.)
 [Situation room]
 T'POL: The Earth cargo ship Fortunate. Y-class
freighter, maximum speed warp one point eight. Crew complement twenty
three.
TRAVIS: Not counting newborn babies.
ARCHER: Ensign?
TRAVIS: I grew up on a J-class, a little smaller but the same basic
design, and one thing I can tell you is that at warp one point eight
you've got a lot of time on your hands between ports. That's how my
parents wound up with me.
T'POL: Do you have any helpful information on this vessel beyond its
recreational activities?
REED: For example, what kind of weapons they carry.
TRAVIS: Well, typically nothing more than a low-yield plasma cannon,
but most freight haulers would've upgraded the first chance they got.
REED: Why is that?
TRAVIS: Think about it. You're a dozen light years from home with
twenty kilotons of dilithium ore in your hold, armed with nothing but a
pop-gun for shooting oncoming meteors. What would you do?
 [Bridge]
 (the Fortunate is on the viewscreen)
REED: I'm reading hull damage. Their warp reactor's offline and most of
their primary systems are down.
ARCHER: Any other ships in the region.
T'POL: None, Captain.
ARCHER: Open a channel. Fortunate, this is Captain Jonathan Archer of
the Starship Enterprise. Fortunate, please respond.
HOSHI: Their comm. systems may be down.
T'POL: I'm reading twenty four biosigns.
ARCHER: Have Doctor Phlox meet us in the Launch bay.
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER: Easy does it. There's a lot of debris out
here.
TRAVIS: Aye sir.
REED: Some of it doesn't appear to be from the Fortunate.
PHLOX: On the bright side, I'm only picking up inorganic material. No
bodies.
REED: The main hatch is damaged. No chance we'll get a positive seal.
TRAVIS: There should be an auxiliary hatch on the port side.
 [Corridor]
 (After docking, the group are met by four men.)
ARCHER: Permission to come aboard.
RYAN: Granted. I'm Matthew Ryan, first officer.
ARCHER: Jonathan Archer, Captain of the Enterprise. Sorry we couldn't
meet under better circumstances. What happened here?
RYAN: Nausicaans. They tried to board us. We managed to fight them off
but not before we took a few bruises.
ARCHER: Nausicaans?
TRAVIS: Pirates, sir. They've been attacking freighters in this sector
for years. My parents had a run-in with them once. They were lucky to
come out of it alive.
RYAN: Your parents ran freight?
TRAVIS: Still do. An old J-class, the Horizon.
ARCHER: I've got repair teams standing by. What can we do?
RYAN: Oh, we can handle this ourselves, Captain, but thank you.
REED: If you didn't need our help, why did you send out a distress
call?
RYAN: One of our younger crewmembers panicked, hit the emergency
beacon. With our comm. down we had no way to tell Starfleet to ignore
it.
ARCHER: Where's your Captain?
RYAN: He was wounded in the attack. I'm in command until he's back on
his feet. I'm sorry we took valuable time away from your mission.
PHLOX: Mister Ryan, I'm a physician. If your Captain or anyone else is
hurt, it wouldn't be right for me to leave without seeing them.
TRAVIS: He's got a lot more experience than any freighter medic I know.
ARCHER: We've come an awfully long way. It would be a shame to turn
around without lending a hand.
 [Fortunate Infirmary]
 RYAN: Is he going to die?
PHLOX: Not any time soon. The Nausicaan weapon disrupted his neural
pathways. I've started him on a cortical regeneration but it'll take
some time.
RYAN: How long?
PHLOX: Two days, maybe three.
ARCHER: Since we have to stick around, we might as well help you get
your ship up and running.
RYAN: That's all right.
ARCHER: I understand you're used to doing things on your own, but we're
here. Use us. We might be able to upgrade your hull plating, your
weapons. Couldn't hurt the next time you run into these Nausicaans. The
sooner you're back at warp, the sooner that cargo you're hauling gets
to where it's supposed to go.
 [Cargo module four]
 SHAW: You're letting them send over more people?
RYAN: A few engineers, that's all.
SHAW: We can't have people crawling all over the place.
RYAN: We'll keep them where they're supposed to be.
SHAW: And what if they find him?
RYAN: What do you want me to do, throw him off the ship? (A group of
men are concealed behind some containers, standing over a Nausicaan who
has been beaten up.) RYAN: Anything? Keep at it. I want those codes.
 [Corridor]
 (Travis examines a piece of equipment.) TRAVIS: Trip'll get
a kick out of this, it's older than he is. The Quartermaster won't have
anything like it but Engineering should be able to make one for you.
RYAN: We've got our own machine shop.
TRAVIS: I'm sure your guys have their hands full. We're happy to do it.
RYAN: That's a transporter. (He gazes at the alcove.)
TRAVIS: Enterprise came with all the trimmings.
RYAN: I've read about them. Have you been through it?
TRAVIS: Not yet. Most of the crew is afraid, but I'm kind of curious to
try it out.
RYAN: They say that for a split second you can actually feel yourself
in both places at once.
TRAVIS: Why do you think I want to try it.
RYAN: So you were on the Horizon? (They start walking again.)
TRAVIS: I was born on her, halfway between
Draylax and Vega Colony.
RYAN: How do your parents feel about you leaving?
TRAVIS: I've still got my sister and her husband aboard the Horizon,
but I know my dad expected me to take over at some point.
RYAN: Then why'd you leave?
TRAVIS: I had to figure out where I wanted to spend the rest of my
life, and I was pretty sure it wasn't on the Draylax - Vega run.
Besides, the Horizon didn't have transporters to play with.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: These valve seals are shot. We'll have to
synthesise some new ones. Give me about forty minutes. If you want, our
resident boomer here can give you a tour.
RYAN: Thanks. I've already seen most of the ship.
TUCKER: You missed the best part. The only warp five engine in the
fleet.
RYAN: I've heard about it.
TUCKER: Once they get installed in the next generation of freighters
it'll change a whole lot of things.
TRAVIS: Even with a warp three engine you'd be able to cut a five year
cargo run down to six months.
RYAN: Warp one point eight works just fine for us. Any faster and
there'd be no time to enjoy the trip.
 [Mess hall]
 TRAVIS: Save room for dessert, home made
ice-cream.
RYAN: You eat this well all the time?
TRAVIS: Chef's the best in Starfleet. I heard the Captain had to call
in a lot of favours to get him on board. It's good you stayed away from
the resequenced meat loaf. They still haven't gotten that right.
RYAN: Resequenced? This tastes real.
TRAVIS: That's because it is.
RYAN: You know the last time I had a steak? Eighteen months ago. All
we've got left now are hydroponics and nutri-paks.
TRAVIS: I remember those. What did we used to call them?
BOTH: Mystery meals.
TRAVIS: My dad was a pretty good cook. He could do magical things with
those nutri-paks.
RYAN: When it was someone's birthday my mother would bake a cake. We
knew batter than to ask what it was made of.
TRAVIS: Didn't stop you from eating it.
RYAN: Oh, no way.
TRAVIS: Your parents on the Fortunate?
RYAN: No. They were on the North Star. (Gloom descends.)
TRAVIS: Were you on board?
RYAN: Yeah, I was one of the survivors. I went to the Fortunate after
that.
TRAVIS: I'm sorry.
RYAN: Running freight is dangerous.
TRAVIS: You ever think about doing something else?
RYAN: You mean join Starfleet?
TRAVIS: The food's not bad.
RYAN: Was this premeditated? Buy me lunch and give me the recruiting
pitch?
TRAVIS: No, but you've spent more time in space than most Starfleet
Captains. There are three more NX class ships on the drawing boards.
They're going to need experienced people.
RYAN: If Starfleet gets all the good crews, who does that leave to run
the freighters?
TRAVIS: Don't worry, not everybody's going to go.
RYAN: You did.
TRAVIS: You think leaving the Horizon was easy for me? That I just took
off because I got tired of the food? That ship was my home.
RYAN: So why'd you leave it? Why did you abandon your family.
TRAVIS: Being in Starfleet is the best thing that ever happened to me.
My parents weren't happy I left, but they respected my decision.
RYAN: Did they? Or were they just saying what you wanted to hear so you
wouldn't feel guilty. Commander Tucker should be done with my valve
assembly by now. Thanks for lunch.
 [Fortunate Corridor]
 (Two boys run past the workers.)
BOY: Come on.
T'POL: Why is power being rerouted from internal sensors to the weapons
systems?
SHAW: Maybe you didn't notice. We were in a battle.
T'POL: The battle is over. I'll remove the bypass.
SHAW: That's all right. You can just leave them.
(Using her scanner, T'Pol discovers a girl hiding in an access port.)
BOY: Ready or not, here I come. Have you seen Nadine?
SHAW: No.
BOY: Have you seen Nadine?
T'POL: I'm sorry, I don't know which child is named Nadine. (The boy runs
off. T'Pol lets the girl out.)
NADINE: Thanks.
T'POL: I just told him the truth.
 [Ready room]
 T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: The repairs are almost finished, Captain.
ARCHER: Acknowledged.
T'POL [OC]: But there is something I need to speak to you about, in
private.
(later)
ARCHER: Those engine parts Mister Tucker gave you working out okay?
RYAN: Some of the connections were off by a few microns, but they
should be fine.
ARCHER: Good. Doctor Phlox tells me Captain Keene's condition is
improving.
RYAN: Well he's still unconscious but the burns are healing, thanks to
your doctor.
ARCHER: Anything else we can do?
RYAN: Thanks, but we're anxious to get underway. Goodbye, Captain.
ARCHER: There's one other question I'd like to ask you. Are there only
humans on board your ship?
RYAN: I think one of the kids has a Teneebian skunk as a pet, if that's
what you mean.
T'POL: It isn't.
ARCHER: T'Pol's scanner picked up a Nausicaan biosign.
RYAN: Are you saying we've got a stowaway?
ARCHER: You know that's not what we're saying. Why don't you tell us
what's going on over there.
RYAN: Well, what are you talking about?
T'POL: My bioscans indicated this Nausicaan was injured.
RYAN: Okay. Not that it's any of your business, but there is a
Nausicaan aboard. He's my prisoner.
ARCHER: What gives you the right to take prisoners?
RYAN: They have been attacking our ship for months, stealing our cargo.
They nearly killed my Captain. Now what gives them the right to do
that?
ARCHER: I want to see him.
RYAN: And what would you do? Take him back to Nausicaa? They'd probably
give him a medal.
ARCHER: What do you plan to do with him?
RYAN: That is my business. Starfleet doesn't have any jurisdiction over
what goes on aboard my ship.
ARCHER: You're right, but there is one thing I do have jurisdiction
over. Archer to Tucker.
TUCKER [OC]: Go ahead, Captain.
ARCHER: I want you to remove all the spare parts and equipment you
installed on the Fortunate.
TUCKER [OC]: Sir?
ARCHER: You heard me, Trip.
RYAN: You wouldn't do that.
ARCHER: Watch me.
 [Cargo Module 8]
 RYAN: He's in there.
ARCHER: Where?
RYAN: He's tied up over there.
T'POL: I'm reading one biosign, but it's not Nausicaan.
(It's Shaw with a rifle. Ryan picks up a pistol too.)
ARCHER: Don't do this.
(Reed fires the first shot, but misses Ryan.)
REED: Get down.
PHLOX: Under the circumstances, I defer to your experience. (Archer also has a phase pistol.)
ARCHER: Ryan! You're making a big mistake.
(to Reed, sotto) Go. (Reed fires before they both move to try and
flank the pair. Ryan fires at the bulkhead above T'Pol before leaving
the module and sealing the door.)
T'POL: Captain, there's a breach.
ARCHER: Ryan! (There's a jolt.)
REED: What was that?
(The module gently floats away from the freighter.)
 [Bridge]
 (The viewscreen is showing it happening.)
TUCKER: What the hell's going on over there?
HOSHI: There are four biosigns on the module. It's the away team.
TUCKER: Tucker to Captain Archer.
 [Cargo Module 8]
 TUCKER [OC]: Are you all right?
ARCHER: We're fine. I don't want the Fortunate leaving.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER: Understood. Hail them.
HOSHI: No response.
TRAVIS: They're charging weapons.
TUCKER: Polarise the hull plating.
 [Cargo Module 8]
 T'POL: The Fortunate has fired its weapons.
ARCHER: Trip, report.
TUCKER [OC]: They're getting a little trigger-happy, sir. Stand by.
Load starboard tubes three and four. Target their engines.
TRAVIS [OC]: Aye, sir.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: They're jettisoning our pod. Their warp
drive's coming online.
TUCKER: Fire. (But the little blue streak doesn't get there in time.)
 [Cargo Module 8]
 TUCKER [OC]: Enterprise to Archer.
ARCHER: How're you doing, Trip?
TUCKER [OC]: We're okay, sir. We didn't take too much damage, but the
Fortunate just went to warp.
ARCHER: Follow them.
T'POL: Captain, considering our rate of decompression, I'd suggest
Enterprise retrieve us as quickly as possible.
ARCHER: Belay that, Trip. Send a shuttlepod over here to pick us up.
We've sprung a leak.
TUCKER [OC]: On our way.
 [Situation room]
 REED: We're trying to track their warp trail, but
their plasma cannon knocked out our long range sensors.
ARCHER: How long till they're back online?
T'POL: Mister Tucker says at least four hours.
TRAVIS: We don't know where they are, but we know who they're looking
for. The Nausicaans. Ryan's after revenge, sir.
T'POL: A very primitive emotion, but it would explain his irrational
behaviour.
TRAVIS: It's rational to him. Those pirates attacked his ship. That's
his family. If we want to find the Fortunate, we need to find the
Nausicaans.
 [Cargo Module 4]
 RYAN: The frequencies.
NAUSICAAN: You're not very skilled at interrogation. I could give you
some lessons.
RYAN: (kicking him in the chest) Give me the frequencies.
NAUSICAAN: You know my shipmates will come for me.
RYAN: I'm counting on it.
 [Fortunate corridor]
 RYAN: That wasn't so difficult, was it.
SHAW: You nearly killed him.
RYAN: Remodulate the weapons.
SHAW: What about the Nausicaan?
RYAN: Keep him locked up. We might still need him.
SHAW: We've got what we wanted. Let's just get him off the ship.
RYAN: How?
SHAW: An escape pod.
RYAN: So his friends can pick him up and he can tell them to change
their shield modulations? What was the point of all this?
SHAW: I've been asking myself the same question. We've always dealt
with the Nausicaans without taking hostages or beating information out
of them.
RYAN: If we don't show them that we're serious, they're never going to
leave us alone.
SHAW: How would the Captain want us to handle this?
RYAN: I'm responsible for this ship now, and I need to know that you
are going to help me do whatever it takes to protect her. (Shaw nods.)
RYAN: We've taken enough casualties. It's time we started inflicting some of
our own.
 Captain's starlog, supplemental. We've picked up a
faint warp trail that could be the Fortunate, but we don't know for
sure until our long range sensors are back online.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Anything?
TRAVIS: No. Try bypassing circuit L-47.
CREWMAN: Aye, sir.
TUCKER: I don't know what's going on with that guy. I can understand
taking on those pirates. I probably would have done the same thing. But
firing on a Starfleet vessel? He's got a lot more than pirates to worry
about now.
TRAVIS: Never thought I'd see a Y-class running from any ship I was on.
When I was growing up on the Horizon, anything that happened on board
you handles yourself. If someone on the crew got into a fight, you just
worked it out. You took care of your own. If Starfleet suddenly showed
up and told my father what he could and couldn't do on his own ship?
TUCKER: Things are changing. Ryan's going to have to figure that out.
TRAVIS: Maybe he already has and he just doesn't like it.
TUCKER: Got it. Sensors are back online.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in.
TRAVIS: Do you have a minute, sir?
ARCHER: I think I can squeeze you in. (Archer gestures for him to sit.) ARCHER: What's
on your mind, Travis?
TRAVIS: Permission to speak freely, sir?
ARCHER: Any time.
TRAVIS: I'm worried that we're not handling the situation the right
way.
ARCHER: Go on.
TRAVIS: You know I'd never question your orders.
ARCHER: You served on one of those freighters. I want to hear your
opinion.
TRAVIS: Maybe Ryan's right. Maybe this isn't any of our business. If he
doesn't want our help, why force it on him.
ARCHER: So you think we should just let Ryan take on the Nausicaans?
TRAVIS: Don't underestimate a freighter crew, sir. My father never ran
into any trouble he couldn't handle himself, Nausicaans included.
ARCHER: So what happens to the Nausicaans?
TRAVIS: Sir?
ARCHER: Suppose Ryan finds the ship that attacked him. Maybe it's been
damaged and the Fortunate is more than a match for them. What do you
think Ryan'll do?
TRAVIS: He'd probably try to blow them out of the sky.
ARCHER: I don't know about you, Travis, but that doesn't sit right with
me. Human beings have a code of behaviour that applies whether they're
Starfleet officers or space boomers, and it isn't driven by revenge.
Just because someone isn't born on Earth doesn't make him any less
human.
TRAVIS: You're right, sir. I suppose I should understand that more than
anyone.
ARCHER: Any other orders of mine you'd like to question?
TRAVIS: Not today, sir. Thank you, sir.
 [Fortunate Bridge]
 RYAN: Are you sure?
SHAW: I've seen that hull signature enough times.
RYAN: The new shield frequencies?
SHAW: Loaded and standing by.
RYAN: Bring the cannons online, drop out of warp.
SHAW: They're just sitting there, a hundred kilometres ahead near a
small asteroid.
RYAN: Put it on the viewer. (A little ship makes a dash.) RYAN: They've seen
us. Lay in an intercept course. Full impulse.
SHAW: We're closing. Twenty kilometres. They're firing. The hull
plating is holding.
RYAN: Can you get a weapons lock?
SHAW: We're out of range. (Another hit.)
RYAN: Then get us into range.
SHAW: Ten kilometres, nine. Cannons locked on target.
RYAN: Return fire.
SHAW: They've gone behind the asteroid. I've lost the lock.
(As Fortunate pursues, we see that the asteroid is a docking port and
facility for lots of Nausicaan ships.)
RYAN: This must be where they offload stolen cargo.
SHAW: I'm getting us out of here.
RYAN: Hold your course.
SHAW: Ryan!
RYAN: We still have their shield frequencies. Lock weapons on the first
ship and fire. (Four hits.)RYAN: Again.
SHAW: No effect.
RYAN: Are you sure you programmed the right frequencies?
SHAW: I used the ones he gave us.
(Other ships undock and start attacking Fortunate.)
RYAN: Go to warp!
SHAW: The reactor is offline.
RYAN: Full impulse, then. Hull plating to maximum. (Another big hit and
explosions.)
SHAW: We've lost impulse. They're hailing us.
NAUSICAAN 2 [on viewscreen]: Our scans show you have one of our crewmen
aboard. I assume you're here to return him.
RYAN: He's our prisoner.
NAUSICAAN 2 [on viewscreen]: He won't be for long.
(a jolt and an alarm sounding)
SHAW: They've latched onto us.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Captain, long range sensors are detecting
weapons fire.
ARCHER: Who's doing the shooting?
REED: It's difficult to be sure at this distance, sir. Looks like some
kind of plasma discharge. I can't rule out our boomer friends.
ARCHER: Lay in a course.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
 [Fortunate Bridge]
 SHAW: They're in the access corridor, section D.
RYAN: How many?
SHAW: Three.
RYAN: Pass out weapons.
SHAW: We know what they're after. Why not just let them have
him>
RYAN: We fought them off before, we can do it again.
SHAW: It was one ship, not three.
RYAN: Weapons.
 [Section D corridor]
 (Ryan opens fire on the Nausicaans and a shooting
match ensues. A crewman is hit.)
SHAW: We should pull back. (They retreat into a cargo module and the
Nausicaans try to cut in.)
 [Bridge]
 REED: It's the Fortunate, sir, and three smaller
ships.
T'POL: Nausicaans.
ARCHER: Polarise the hull plating. Drop us out of warp. Are we in
range?
HOSHI: Two hundred thousand kilometres ahead.
ARCHER: Put it up. (Two small ships circling the Fortunate.)
T'POL: There are four Nausicaan biosigns on board the Fortunate and I'm
detecting weapon discharges.
ARCHER: Hail the Nausicaans.
HOSHI: Which ship, sir?
ARCHER: Lets see who answers.
 [Cargo Module 4]
 (The men are holed up with their prisoner as the
Nausicaans try to cut through the door.)
SHAW: We'd better get him to the infirmary.
RYAN: He's going to be okay.
NAUSICAAN: I told you they'd come for me.
RYAN: Shut up.
 [Bridge]
 NAUSICAAN 2 [on viewscreen]: We're involved in a
rescue operation.
ARCHER: There's a lot of firing going on for a rescue.
NAUSICAAN 2 [on viewscreen]: We want our crewman back.
TRAVIS: He wouldn't be there if you hadn't attacked them in the first
place.
ARCHER: Perhaps we have an opportunity here to improve relations
between your people and mine.
NAUSICAAN 2 [on viewscreen]: We're happy with our relations the way
they are.
ARCHER: I have a proposal for you. We'll get your man back and then
you'll let the Fortunate continue on her way.
NAUSICAAN 2 [on viewscreen]: You're facing three of my ships. We are
not interested in your proposals.
ARCHER: We've scanned your ships. Mister Reed.
REED: Fore and aft plasma cannons. I doubt those shields of theirs
would hold up to our torpedoes.
ARCHER: You're not sneaking up on an old freighter this time. This is
an NX Class Starship. Take a good look, because you'll be seeing more
of them. Now, you can reconsider my offer or you can take your chances.
NAUSICAAN 2 [on viewscreen]: If you think you can convince them to
return our crewman, do it quickly. Otherwise we'll be forced to take
our chances.
 [Cargo Module 4]
 (The Nausicaans break through the door, and the
shooting starts again.)
ARCHER [OC]: Enterprise to Ryan. This is Jonathan Archer. We're ten
thousand metres off your starboard bow. I know you can hear me. Why
don't you think about what's best for your crew and let us help you?
RYAN: What a relief. Starfleet's come to save the day.
ARCHER [OC]: I've spoken
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: To the Nausicaan Captain. He's willing to
let the Fortunate go if you turn over his crewman.
 [Cargo Module 4]
 RYAN: What, and you believe him? You believe
they're just going to let us fly away?
ARCHER [OC]: I've got an armoury of torpedoes that will make sure they
do.
RYAN: What about next time, when another freighter gets jumped
 [Bridge]
 RYAN [OC]: In the middle of nowhere. What then?
ARCHER: You've got a chance to stop this before anyone else gets hurt.
RYAN [OC]: I'm dealing with them the only way they understand.
REED: One of the Nausicaan ships has locked weapons on us, sir.
ARCHER: This has gone on long enough. Now you're putting my crew in
danger. Release that hostage.
 [Cargo Module 4]
 RYAN: He's my prisoner, and I'm going to handle
 [Bridge]
 RYAN [OC]: This in my way.
TRAVIS: What are you going to do, kill him?
RYAN [OC]: Oh, you again.
TRAVIS: Sir, with your permission. You think killing one of them is
going to accomplish anything?
 [Cargo Module 4]
 RYAN: What, your Captain decide a little boomer to
boomer talk would persuade me?
TRAVIS [OC]: Just shut up and listen to me. I don't give a damn about
you any more.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: I'm just thinking about my family.
RYAN [OC]: What have they got to do with this?
TRAVIS: What's going to happen to the next freighter that runs into the
Nausicaans? What if it's the Horizon and they have to pay the price for
your
 [Cargo Module 4]
 TRAVIS [OC]: Stubborn stupidity.
RYAN: I'm doing this for them.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: The hell you are! This isn't about
protecting cargo ships.
RYAN [OC]: That is just what it's about.
TRAVIS: Don't kid yourself into thinking you're doing this for some
greater good. This is about revenge, nothing else.
REED: The Nausicaan ships are firing, sir.
ARCHER: Return fire. Starboard tubes three and four.
TRAVIS: You don't like me because I left the Horizon to join Starfleet.
You're afraid that if more people do that there won't be anyone left to
run the freighters. Maybe you're right
 [Cargo Module 4]
 TRAVIS [OC]: Maybe not. But if you don't let your
hostage go
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: The Nausicaans are going to kill you and
your crew.
ARCHER: Port tubes one and two, fire.
TRAVIS: And then there'll be twenty three fewer people out there to run
those freighters.
 [Cargo Module 4]
 TRAVIS [OC]: No maybes. (Ryan hauls the Nausicaan to his feet.)
RYAN: Hold your fire! Take him.
(The Nausicaans leave, quickly.)
 [Bridge]
 REED: The Nausicaans are powering down their
weapons. They're moving off, sir.
 [Fortunate Infirmary]
 ARCHER: Need a hand? (Keene eases himself off the bed.)
KEENE: Just a little stiff. Thank your
doctor for me. I've got some Drilaxian whisky stashed away, if you'd
like to join me.
ARCHER: I'm on duty.
KEENE: Too bad. If you've never had it, you're missing one of the
galaxy's real pleasures. I'm reducing Mister Ryan's rank to Able
Crewman. He gets to spend the rest of the trip purging hydraulic pumps.
ARCHER: If you think he's going to be a problem, we could take him back
to Earth.
KEENE: No, we take care of our own. Besides, that would leave me a man
short.
ARCHER: Understood.
KEENE: I made him my first officer because I trusted him with my ship.
It's going to take him quite a while to earn that back.
ARCHER: His intentions were good, but someone should teach him to
accept help when it's offered.
KEENE: The ones that grew up out here feel they have some special
claim, that this particular stretch of space is theirs. They see
another ship within ten light years, they get jumpy.
ARCHER: They're going to be seeing a lot more ships than they're used
to.
KEENE: The ships get faster. It's progress, I suppose. My family's been
on the Fortunate for three generations. Now, I'm going to need at least
a warp three engine to stay in business.
ARCHER: Maybe that's not so bad. At warp three, help's a lot closer
than before. You won't have to go it alone.
KEENE: Going it alone's all I've ever done, and for some of us it's the
reason we're out here. A chance to prove ourselves.
ARCHER: I think you've already done that.
KEENE: Well, we'll adapt, we always have, but things just won't be the
same. (They shake hands.)
ARCHER: Good luck.
KEENE: Sure you won't join me for that drink?
ARCHER: Thanks, but my crew's anxious to get underway. Next time.

Cold
Front
 Original Airdate: 28 Nov, 2001
  [Temporal
Communication Chamber]
(Silik is strapped into a device with tubes into
his head.)
SILIK: This wasn't part of our agreement.
FUTURE MAN: You failed in your last mission. The Klingon Empire is
intact. You knew there would be consequences.
SILIK: Please, I won't disappoint you again.
FUTURE MAN: We'll restore it, but only if you succeed in your next
mission.
SILIK: But you're disabling me.
FUTURE MAN: You won't need enhanced vision where you're going. Proceed
with the extraction.
(A Suliban medic aims a long needle at Silik's eye.)
 [Turbolift]
 TRAVIS: Hold the door. Where were you last night?
HOSHI: I decided to turn in early.
TRAVIS: Well, you didn't miss much.
HOSHI: What'd they show?
TRAVIS: Night of the Killer Androids.
HOSHI: That bad?
TRAVIS: We've got fifty thousand movies in the database. There must be
something worth watching.
HOSHI: You could always read a book.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Lieutenant.
REED: Ensigns. Enjoy the show last night? Those were two hours of my
life I'd rather have back.
 [Captain's mess]
 DANIELS: Good morning, sir.
ARCHER: Morning, Daniels. I thought this was Taylor's shift.
DANIELS: I switched with him, if that's all right with you.
ARCHER: No problem.
DANIELS: Sir, I noticed we changed course. May I ask why?
ARCHER: There's a stellar nursery not far from here. We detected
several ships inside. We thought we might go say hello.
DANIELS: Very good, sir. More orange juice?
ARCHER: No, thanks, I'm fine.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: What have you got?
TRAVIS: We found one of the ships, sir.
ARCHER: Put it up.
(The ship is on the viewscreen.)
T'POL: It appears to be a transport vessel.
ARCHER: Hail them.
HOSHI: They're responding.
(It is a reptilian type with large scale plates.)
FRADDOCK [on viewscreen]: Can I help you?
ARCHER: My name is Archer. I'm Captain of the starship Enterprise.
We're from Earth. We thought we'd introduce ourselves.
FRADDOCK [on viewscreen]: Pleased to meet you. What do you want?
ARCHER: Nothing. We're new to this region and we're eager to make
contact with other species.
FRADDOCK [on viewscreen]: Oh.
ARCHER: If you don't mind my asking, what brings you here?
FRADDOCK [on viewscreen]: A job. I'm escorting a group of spiritually
minded men on a pilgrimage to the Great Plume of Agosoria.
ARCHER: The, the what?
FRADDOCK [on viewscreen]: Every eleven years, one of the protostars
gives out a neutron blast. These gentlemen believe it's a sacred event.
If you ask me, I think it's just another ball of hydrogen.
T'POL: When is this Great Plume due to erupt?
FRADDOCK [on viewscreen]: Tomorrow.
ARCHER: Mind if we join you?
FRADDOCK [on viewscreen]: It's your time to waste.
ARCHER: I'd like to extend an invitation to you and your passengers to
visit Enterprise.
FRADDOCK [on viewscreen]: I'll ask them if they're interested. I prefer
to stay with my ship.
ARCHER: Understood, Mister?
FRADDOCK [on viewscreen]: Fraddock. Captain Fraddock.
(Ends transmission)
ARCHER: Looks like we could be having guests. Tell Chef to prepare
something.
 [Docking port]
 TUCKER: Seal's good.
ARCHER: Welcome aboard. Captain Jonathan Archer. It's customary on
Earth to greet someone with a handshake.
(Archer holds his hand out to an alien with a very high forehead with
ridged domes.)
MANTOOS: I'm Prah Mantoos. May Agosoria embrace you into his
cycle of renewal.
ARCHER: Thanks.
MANTOOS: These are my fellow celebrants. We've travelled many light
years from different worlds to watch this event.
TUCKER: I'm Commander Tucker, Chief Engineer, and this is our Science
Officer, Sub-commander T'Pol.
MANTOOS: For you, Captain.
(Mantoos hands over glass circle with etchings, in a stand.)
ARCHER: It's beautiful. What exactly is it?
MANTOOS: A clock. It charts time from the beginning of the universe.
(With points around the chin and eyebrows.)
SONSORRA: Voo-Sinteel.
(He hands a long bottle of red liquid to Tucker.)
SONSORRA: It's a spirit traditionally consumed as the Plume reaches its
full brilliance. You'll find it enhances the experience.
TUCKER: Mmm, I'm sure it does.
ARCHER: You're very generous. I'm afraid the only thing we have to
offer you is our hospitality.
MANTOOS: That will be more than enough.
ARCHER: Our chef has prepared a meal in your honour.
MANTOOS: Normally we fast during the Time of Agosoria, but in this case
I suppose we can break with tradition.
ARCHER: Please.
(He leads the way.)
 [Mess hall]
 (A buffet meal. Some crew are in casual dress.)
ARCHER: Four months, three weeks and
T'POL: Six days.
MANTOOS: You've travelled a great distance in a short period of time.
TUCKER: Warp five will get you where you're going pretty fast.
ARCHER: We've seen a lot since we left Earth but I have to say that
this place is definitely one of the highlights.
MANTOOS: I'm pleased you appreciate its beauty, Captain. To us, it's
more than just a simple stellar nursery. According to our sacred text
this is where the universe began.
TUCKER: And the Great Plume of A, Ager?
SONSORRA: Agosoria.
TUCKER: Agosoria. How does that fit in?
MANTOOS: It represents the continuing cycle of creation.
PHLOX: It's not unlike the Hindu faith, Commander. They also believe
that the universe goes through repeated cycles of rebirth.
ARCHER: I didn't realise you were familiar with Earth religions,
Doctor.
PHLOX: Oh, yes. In fact, while I was there I made it a point to study a
number of them. I spent two weeks at a Tibetan monastery where I
learned to sing chords with the high lamas. I attended Mass at Saint
Peter's Square. I was even allowed to observe the Tal-Shanar at the
Vulcan consulate.
SONSORRA: I understand Vulcans are a deeply spiritual people.
 T'POL: Our beliefs are based on logic and the pursuit
of clarity.
SONSORRA: Do you follow a particular faith, Captain?
ARCHER: I guess you could say I try to keep an open mind.
MANTOOS: Many who see the Great Plume are often inspired by it. Perhaps
you will be, too.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Did you get to meet them?
HOSHI: Two, briefly.
REED: What were they like?
HOSHI: Quiet. They're taking a tour of the ship.
TRAVIS: Looks like the Captain's going all out.
REED: I hope he's not planning to show them the Armory.
HOSHI: Don't worry, Lieutenant. They didn't look like the types who'd
go around stealing military secrets.
REED: Still, we're not familiar with these species. Tactical systems
should be off-limits. Starboard targeting sensor's out again.
HOSHI: Should I call Engineering?
REED: No. I'll take care of it. It'll only take a moment. You have the
Bridge, Ensign.
(Reed leaves.)
HOSHI: Aren't you going to take the chair?
TRAVIS: What?
HOSHI: You're in command.
TRAVIS: I'm fine right here.
HOSHI: Haven't you ever wondered what it's like?
TRAVIS: I can wait till I'm promoted.
HOSHI: Okay.
(Travis goes and sits in the Captain's chair.)
TRAVIS: Nice fit. Bridge looks a lot different from here.
Think anyone would mind if I fired a torpedo?
REED: Permission to take my station?
TRAVIS: Sorry, sir.
(He returns to helm.)
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: The gravimetric field displacement
manifold, commonly known as the warp reactor. Just think of it as a
great big engine but instead of using electricity or chemical fuel it
runs on antimatter. See this swirling light? When matter and antimatter
collide it creates a whole lot of energy. We channel that energy
through those conduits over there. They lead to the two large glowing
cylinders you may have seen on the outside of the ship.
SONSORRA: The nacelles.
TUCKER: That's right.
SONSORRA: Which contain warp coils that create the subspace
displacement field.
TUCKER: I see you already know a thing or two about starship engines.
SONSORRA: I'm a warp field theorist.
TUCKER: Oh. Well, I guess that covers the basics. Any questions?
ALIEN: How do you regulate positron flow in your dilithium matrix?
TUCKER: Good one. I'll bring up the schematic of the reactor assembly
and you can see for yourself. If you'll just come with me. We use a
series of magnetic constrictors to align the positron stream.
(One of the point-chinned aliens breaks away from the group.)
TUCKER: If any stray particles escape backups automatically kick in.
During one of our training tests we momentarily lost the primaries and
the backups.
(The alien's arm becomes very flexible as he reaches into part of the
engine and pulls connections before rejoining the group.)
TUCKER: About a billion positrons cut through the plating on three
decks. Nearly caused a hull breach. We spent a month redesigning the
system. It hasn't given us a single problem since.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: We're being hailed by Captain Fraddock.
TRAVIS: He's probably calling about the weather.
T'POL: On screen.
FRADDOCK [on viewscreen]: You might want to focus your sensors on that
plasma lightning up ahead.
T'POL: We're aware of it.
FRADDOCK [on viewscreen]: You ever been in a plasma storm?
T'POL: Twice.
FRADDOCK [on viewscreen]: Then you know it can get a little bumpy. I
suggest we try and go around it.
T'POL: Agreed. Ensign.
TRAVIS: I'm already on it.
 [Sickbay]
(As a volunteer comes out of the body scanner.)
PHLOX: There's your heart, lungs, liver, another heart. Every
organ. This imaging device also allows us to examine your genetic
structure. Ah, you'll be happy to know you're in perfect health. Who
would like to go next?
(The ship judders.)
ARCHER: Excuse me. Archer to the Bridge. Report.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: We're circumnavigating a plasma storm,
Captain.
 [Sickbay]
 T'POL [OC]: It's just turbulence from the outer
edge.
MANTOOS: They're very common in this region. I'm sure there's nothing
to worry about.
 [Bridge]
 REED: That one hit our port bow. Power's down on
C-Deck, subsection four. No other damage.
T'POL: Ensign.
TRAVIS: The storm's moving in our direction. I'm having trouble getting
around it.
T'POL: What about the transport ship?
TRAVIS: He's far enough ahead. He made it past.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: We've got a power surge in the impulse
relays. Here's a good example of how we can reroute the energy flow to
protect our critical systems.
(A big jolt and lights flicker.)
ARCHER: I'm afraid we have to cut the tour a little short. I'll be on
the Bridge.
 [Bridge]
 (Lightning strikes the ship.)
ARCHER: Report.
REED: We're losing main power.
ARCHER: Trip.
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER [OC]: What's happening?
TUCKER: That last bolt struck the warp manifold!
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER [OC]: We've got an antimatter cascade, sir!
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: If it reaches the warp reactor we're going
to (a series of explosions then the lights come back on) I think we're
all right, Captain. The cascade stopped in its tracks.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Good work, Trip.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: It wasn't me, sir.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER: Sorry about the bad weather.
MANTOOS: We're used to it. I'm just grateful there was no serious
damage.
ARCHER: If any of your group would like to watch the Great Plume from
our Mess Hall, they're welcome to come back tomorrow.
MANTOOS: I'll let them know.
ARCHER: Have a great time, Doctor.
PHLOX: I plan to, Captain. Thank you for letting me spend the night
with these people.
ARCHER: I'll expect a full report in the morning.
PHLOX: Aye, Captain.
(Archer speaks to Mantoos, as the group heads through the airlock).
ARCHER: Hope to see you tomorrow.
TUCKER [OC]: Tucker to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead, Trip.
TUCKER [OC]: Can you come down to Engineering for a minute?
ARCHER: On my way.
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER: What is it, Trip?
TUCKER: Take a look at this.
ARCHER: What?
(Tucker reachs into where the alien stuck his arm.)
TUCKER: Right up there. See that conduit?
ARCHER: Yeah.
TUCKER: It's an antimatter junction. It stopped the cascade from
reaching the warp reactor.
ARCHER: What are you getting at?
TUCKER: Somebody got in here and disconnected it from the primary
antimatter feed. If they hadn't, that cascade would have continued
right into the reactor core, and this ship would have gone up just like
the Great Plume of Agosoria.
ARCHER: One of your staff?
TUCKER: I already asked. Nobody seems to know anything about it.
ARCHER: Sounds to me like you've got a hero who's a little reluctant
about taking credit. Talk to them again. Whoever did this deserves a
commendation.
TUCKER: I'm telling you, sir, I don't think it was one of my people.
They would have said something.
 [Ready room]
 FRADDOCK: I spoke with every one of them.
TUCKER: How about the warp theorist?
FRADDOCK: Him, too. None of them went anywhere near that conduit. If I
told you I did it, would there be some kind of reward?
ARCHER: Thank you, Captain.
FRADDOCK: Maybe it was the Cycle of Renewal.
ARCHER: If anyone comes forward, you'll let me know?
FRADDOCK: Oh, you'll be the first.
 [Corridor]
 DANIELS: Sir, I need to speak with you.
ARCHER: Why don't you talk to one of my Bridge officers. I'm a little
busy right now.
DANIELS: It's important.
ARCHER: I'm sorry Daniels, I've got my hands full.
DANIELS: It's about the Suliban.
ARCHER: What about them?
DANIELS: I've reason to believe that one of the pilgrims who came
aboard today is a Suliban soldier. His name is Silik. He's the man you
fought with on the Helix.
ARCHER: How the hell do you know what I did on the Helix?
DANIELS: It might be best if we discussed this in private.
ARCHER: My ready room.
DANIELS: I think it'd be better if we went to my quarters.
ARCHER: What?
DANIELS: You'll understand when we get there, sir.
 [Daniel's quarters]
 (A very small room with two bunk beds)
DANIELS: Oh, please, have a seat. I'm sorry about the mess. Sometimes I
think my bunk-mate majored in Chaos Theory.
(He takes a case out of a locker.)
ARCHER: What is that? That doesn't look like Starfleet issue.
DANIELS: That's because I'm not a member of Starfleet. Not that I
wouldn't be honoured to be one, sir, especially after spending time
ARCHER: Who are you? How do you know what happened on the Helix?
DANIELS: Did Silik tell you who he was working for?
ARCHER: I'm the one asking questions, crewman.
DANIELS: Did he mention the Temporal Cold War?
ARCHER: What do you know about that?
DANIELS: A great deal more than you do, sir.
ARCHER: If you're not a member of Starfleet, then who are you?
DANIELS: I work for a different kind of organization. We make sure that
people like Silik don't interfere with historical events.
ARCHER: I've never heard of a group like that.
DANIELS: That's because it doesn't exist yet.
ARCHER: So you're telling me you're some kind of a time traveller?
DANIELS: That's one way of putting it. Maybe this'll help clear things
up.
(He activates device from the case and the room is filled with
holographic data representations.)
DANIELS: This is how we keep an eye on what's going on. You might call
it a Temporal Observatory. I know this must seem a little overwhelming.
ARCHER: Overwhelming doesn't quite cover it.
DANIELS: I come from right about, right about here. Approximately nine
hundred years from now.
ARCHER: Are you human?
DANIELS: More or less.
ARCHER: And the people giving Silik orders?
DANIELS: They're from an earlier century. From about here. They can't
manifest themselves physically in the past. They can only partially
materialise to deliver information.
ARCHER: But not you?
DANIELS: In the years that followed we eventually perfected the
process.
ARCHER: Sounds dangerous.
DANIELS: When time travel was first developed, it wasn't long before
people realised that laws had to be made. All the species who had the
technology agreed that it would only be used for research.
ARCHER: But it wasn't. That's what the Temporal Cold War is all about.
DANIELS: Look at this. This is a group of anthropologists from 2769
observing the construction of the Great Pyramid at Giza. They're doing
it using the proper procedures set forth in the Temporal Accord. But
there are factions that ignore those procedures.
ARCHER: Why are you telling me all this?
DANIELS: (switches off images) Silik is the one who prevented the
reactor breach.
ARCHER: Are you implying Silik was sent here to save my ship, and if he
hadn't we would have been destroyed today?
DANIELS: I am not implying anything. All I'm saying is that I was
assigned here to capture Silik when he came aboard. He is a threat and
I need you to help me capture him.
ARCHER: You're from nine hundred years in the future, and you need my
help?
DANIELS: The Suliban have been given genetic enhancements that allow
them to evade most sensors. They're nearly impossible to detect.
ARCHER: I've noticed.
DANIELS: I have special equipment that can help track Silik but it'll
be far more effective if I can tie it into your internal sensor grid.
I'll need access to Main Engineering and your command codes. But we
have reason to believe that the twenty second century is a front in
this cold war. What happens here could affect millennia to come. It's
imperative that we find out who Silik is working for and what they're
trying to do.
ARCHER: If I decide to help you I can't do it alone. I need to inform
some of my crew.
DANIELS: The fewer the better. You're asking me to capture someone who
just saved my ship. Why should I trust you?
DANIELS: You like your scrambled eggs soft. Have I ever brought them to
you any other way?
 [Ready room]
(Archer pours out the Voo-Sinteel.)
ARCHER: You sure you don't want a glass?
T'POL: I'm sure. The Vulcan Science Directorate has studied the
question of time travel in great detail. They found no evidence that it
exists or that it can exist.
ARCHER: The Suliban woman I spoke with, Sarin, she also used the phrase
Temporal Cold War.
TUCKER: That's what Daniels called it?
ARCHER: The same words.
T'POL: That proves nothing.
ARCHER: What about the Suliban's genetic engineering? Phlox says it's
far beyond their abilities.
T'POL: That doesn't mean that it was given to them by visitors from the
future. Until Daniels can offer you concrete proof, I'd remain
extremely skeptical.
ARCHER: I'm telling you, he pushed a button on this device and the
whole room changed.
TUCKER: On the Xyrillian ship I was in a holographic chamber where I
could've sworn I was in a boat at sea. If what Daniels says is true,
then Silik saved Enterprise. Maybe we shouldn't look a gift horse in
the mouth.
ARCHER: If there's even a possibility that this cold war exists, we
can't ignore Daniels' request.
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Yes, Hoshi.
HOSHI [OC]: We're approaching the protostar, sir
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: And the transport ship is requesting
permission to dock. Some of the passengers would like to take you up on
your offer and observe it from the Mess Hall.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Initiate docking procedures. I'll be right
there. One of them might be Silik. We don't have time to debate this
any longer. (to T'Pol) I want you to help Daniels.
 [Turbolift]
 TUCKER: I always knew we'd be meeting people from
other planets, but other centuries? You're not buying any of this, are
you?
T'POL: If Daniels could travel through time why not simply go back one
more day into the past and prevent Silik from boarding this ship in the
first place?
TUCKER: Maybe that's plan B.
T'POL: Or maybe he's really not from the future.
TUCKER: Then why make up such a crazy story?
T'POL: He could be trying to conceal his true intentions.
TUCKER: I thought you scientists were supposed to keep an open mind.
T'POL: There's a difference between keeping an open mind and believing
something because you want it to be true.
TUCKER: What the hell's that supposed to mean?
 [Mess hall]
 PHLOX: Roja durana tua teenan, Captain. That is a
traditional greeting on the morning of Agosoria. It means, may the
Plume light your way.
ARCHER: I take it you enjoyed your visit.
PHLOX: Oh, it was mesmerising. Four hours of ritual prayer followed by
the Kaana-sah, a series of exercises designed to purify the body. I
think I strained a leg muscle, but it was well worth it.
ARCHER: How many decided to join us?
PHLOX: Eleven, I believe. The others wanted to observe the star from
their ship.
ARCHER: So that leaves six on the transport?
PHLOX: I didn't take a head count but that sounds about right.
ARCHER: Did any of them seem out of place?
PHLOX: How do you mean?
ARCHER: Did they all take part in the rituals?
PHLOX: As far as I could tell, but our eyes were closed most of the
time. Is there something wrong, Captain?
ARCHER: No, just curious.
PHLOX: You seem a little preoccupied.
ARCHER: It's been a long night. Glad you had a good time. Enjoy the
view.
PHLOX: I will.
 [Engineering]
 DANIELS: My equipment draws a lot of power. I'll
need another twenty megawatts routed to your sensor grid.
T'POL: Commander?
TUCKER: The grid can handle it. So I take it your brother isn't really
an orbital engineer at Jupiter Station.
DANIELS: Actually, I don't have a brother.
TUCKER: And you didn't grow up in Illinois.
DANIELS: Oh, I'm from a place called Illinois, sir. Just not the one
you're familiar with.
TUCKER: It's good to know Earth will still be around in nine hundred
years.
DANIELS: That depends on how you define Earth.
TUCKER: Beg your pardon?
DANIELS: You might want to initialise the grid. I'm ready to download
the biometric parameters.
TUCKER: Right. What's this?
(He picks up Daniels' device.)
DANIELS: It's very delicate. Please don't.
(A holographic screen is being projected from it.)
DANIELS: Please don't touch it.
TUCKER: You know, we've got a little pool going in Engineering where we
try to guess how far the ship will travel each day. I don't suppose you
could give me a tip on tomorrow's distance.
DANIELS: I'm afraid we don't monitor events quite that closely.
T'POL: One of the power relays is offline.
TUCKER: Must have been damaged during the plasma storm. J-37. It's
about three metres behind that bulkhead.
(Daniels slips a device over his hand.)
DANIELS:  I'll take care of it.
(He goes to the bulkhead.)
DANIELS: J-37?
(Daniels activates device and walks through the wall, a few moments and
back he comes.)
DANIELS: Try it now.
 [Archer's quarters]
 (Porthos is barking.)
ARCHER: I know, I know, your breakfast is two hours late. Don't give me
that look. If it's any consolation I missed my breakfast, too.
(Porthos keeps barking.)
ARCHER: What's the problem? You're not getting any cheese.
(Porthos ignores his bowl and starts growling. Archer moves to the
comm.)
SILIK: If you're thinking of calling for help I'd advise against it.
(materialises) I'm not the one you should be worried about, Jon.
ARCHER: What are you doing here?
SILIK: I thought you might want to thank me. I saved your life. The
least you could do is return the favour. There's someone here trying to
find me. I need to know who it is.
ARCHER: I don't know what you're talking about.
SILIK: I detected tachyon radiation. You don't have anything that emits
tachyons. Who's looking for me?
ARCHER: I don't know.
SILIK: Did they tell you that ridiculous story about their noble
efforts to protect history? The great Temporal Accord? They're lying to
you, Jon. None of it is true. Whoever contacted you is working for
another faction. They didn't come here to protect history. They came to
alter it. Who do you think was responsible for the antimatter cascade
that nearly destroyed your ship? It was them. I was sent to prevent it.
ARCHER: And why would you want to do that? The first time we met, you
tried to kill me.
SILIK: I saved your ship because I was instructed to.
ARCHER: By whom? What does Enterprise have to do with your temporal
war?
SILIK: I'm not privy to that kind of information, but I can tell you
this. Whoever's looking for me is a danger to your crew. If you want to
continue on your mission you'll help me find them.
T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
(Silik draws a weapon, then gestures him to answer.)
ARCHER: Archer here.
T'POL [OC]: We've finished the modifications.
ARCHER: Thanks. I'll be there in a few minutes.
T'POL [OC]: Mister Daniels is eager to get started.
ARCHER: He'll have to wait a few minutes. Archer out.
SILIK: You've been very helpful, Jon.
(Silik shoots him and walks out the door, leaving Porthos barking and
licking at his master's face.)
 [Mess hall]
 MANTOOS: It's beginning.
PHLOX: How long before we see the Plume?
MANTOOS: Well, that's hard to predict. Every cycle is unique. Would you
care to recite the Invocation of Renewal with us?
PHLOX: I'd be honoured. Goran tonia Agosoria.
MANTOOS: Yoraya.
PHLOX: Yoraya uralan porporo gost.
ALL: Goran tonia Agosoria. Yoraya uralan porporo gost.
PHLOX: Totonya tur eeta dura.
ALL: Totonya tur eeta dura.
PHLOX: Tyana morita.
ALL: Tyana morita.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Does this mean it's working?
DANIELS: It's working.
(His device chirps.)
T'POL: What is it?
DANIELS: Suliban biosigns. He's somewhere on this deck. I can't isolate
him, but he's close. Call Lieutenant Reed. Tell him to seal off C Deck.
And it wouldn't hurt if he could get down here with a security team.
(Tucker sees a ripple against a bulkhead.)
TUCKER: What's that?
DANIELS: You two should go.
TUCKER: We're not leaving.
DANIELS: Go! Bring help. Go.
(The outline of a figure is on the upper gantry.)
TUCKER: Evacuate Engineering. Everybody out!
(All the crew leave the room. Silik
points his gun at Daniels.)
SILIK: Did they tell you that the twenty second century was
going to be your final resting place?
(Silik shoots him and he ripples, again and he flies apart. Tucker
watches with T'Pol from the doorway.)
TUCKER: Still skeptical? Tucker to Captain Archer. Captain, are you
there? 
(T'Pol checks the sensors.)
T'POL: He's in his quarters.
TUCKER: Tucker to Doctor Phlox.
PHLOX [OC]: Yes, Commander.
TUCKER: Meet us in the Captain's quarters on the double.
PHLOX [OC]: On my way.
 [Archer's quarters]
(Phlox gives an injection and Archer wakes.) 
PHLOX: Easy, Captain. Aside from a nasty headache, you're going to be
fine. You were stunned by a particle weapon.
ARCHER: It was Silik. I guess he decided not to try and kill me this
time.
TUCKER: He wasn't quite as generous when it came to Daniels. He's dead,
sir.
ARCHER: Have our guests left yet?
T'POL: No, the Plume is just beginning.
ARCHER: Enterprise to Captain Fraddock.
FRADDOCK [OC]: Fraddock.
ARCHER: I'm looking for one of your passengers. Have any of the ones
who were here returned in the last hour or so?
FRADDOCK [OC]: None.
ARCHER: You're sure?
FRADDOCK [OC]: The hatch has been sealed the entire time.
ARCHER: Thanks. Archer out.
(He opens another channel.)
ARCHER: Mister Reed.
 [Bridge]
 REED: Yes, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: We've got a Suliban loose on the ship.
 [Archer's quarters]
 ARCHER: I want you to lock down every outer door
and exit hatch. Post security teams on all decks.
REED [OC]: Understood.
ARCHER: Do you think you can find him using Daniels' sensors?
TUCKER: I can sure as hell try.
ARCHER: Get to Engineering.
TUCKER: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: T'Pol. Thanks, Doc.
 [Daniels quarters]
 (Archer takes the case from the locker and opens
it.)
T'POL: Captain?
ARCHER: It's gone. He took it.
T'POL: Took what?
ARCHER: The device I told you about. The one Daniels used to show me
all those things. That kind of information could give an advantage to
whomever Silik's working for.
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: Someone just used our comm. system to
transmit a message.
 [Daniels quarters]
 ARCHER: What kind of message?
HOSHI [OC]: It's encrypted, sir.
 [Engineering]
 (As the people in the mess hall watch as
spectacular display of stellar pyrotechnics.)
ARCHER: Anything?
TUCKER: I'm sorry, Captain. I can't make heads or tails of most of
this. These might represent Suliban bio-signs but I wouldn't bet on it.
(Silik squishes himself through narrow gaps between conduits in the
bulkheads.)
TUCKER: B-deck, service junction 59. Somebody's trying to bypass the
lock out codes for Launch Bay Two.
ARCHER: Tell Malcolm to meet me with a security team.
TUCKER: Captain, I've got something that might give you a leg up.
 [Corridor]
 REED: Looks like he slipped through here. We could
remove these conduits but it would take some time.
(Archer switches on Daniels' 'walk through walls' device)
REED: Sir?
(Archer tests it, his hand passes through the bulkhead. Reed hands over
a phase pistol.)
ARCHER: Stay here.
 [Service Junction 59]
 SILIK: Very clever. Careful, Jon. It would be a
shame to trigger another antimatter cascade. There'd be nobody here to
stop it.
ARCHER: Put that device on the floor.
SILIK: It would be in your best interest to let me take it.
ARCHER: You keep saying you're here to help us, but I can't stop
wondering what kind of genetic enhancements you'll get for bringing
back that little prize. Eyes in the back of your head? A pair of wings?
SILIK: That's a cynical attitude, Jon. I thought your species was more
trusting.
(Enterprise shakes violently, both fall, there's a fight, Silik loses
his weapon but escapes into a Jefferies tube.)
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: There's a vessel approaching no bigger
than a shuttlepod. It's Suliban.
 [Launch Bay]
 ARCHER: I'm not going to ask you again. Put it
down.
SILIK: You're going to kill me after I saved your life?
(Silik shoots Daniels holoprojector out of his hand.)
SILIK: You may have endangered your future, Jon.
(Silik disappears into the main bay. Suddenly hatch 4 opens and Archer
is hanging onto a rail to stop being sucked into space. He drops his
phase pistol and crawls onto a walk way. Silik calmly dives out of the
ship. Archer manages to get out of the bay, close the launch doors and
recompress the area. Silik free-falls to the Suliban pod)
T'POL: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Yeah.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: A Suliban vessel just took something in and
went to warp. Should we go after them?
 [Launch bay]
 ARCHER: No. Let 'em go.
 [Ready room]
(Archer admires his new clock.) 
ARCHER: Come in.
T'POL: The transport ship has left. We're ready to resume course. Have
you learned how it works?
ARCHER: Not a clue. Starfleet's in store for one hell of a report. I'm
not quite sure where to begin.
T'POL: I'd be glad to help.
ARCHER: First thing in the morning. I don't know about you, but I could
use a good night's sleep.
T'POL: Agreed.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Mister Reed, assign new quarters to
Daniels' roommate and seal off cabin E-14. It's off-limits til further
notice.
REED: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: God knows what else is in there. Let's get back on the road,
Travis.
(A big security magnetic lock is clamped on Daniels' door and the light
glows red.)

  [Bridge]
 (A satellite spreads its panels and points its
antenna back towards home.)
REED: Echo Two is away, sir. A clean launch.
T'POL: It's made contact with Echo One.
ARCHER: How long before we get subspace online?
HOSHI: I'd like to send a few test transmissions to calibrate
amplifiers. An hour.
ARCHER: My guess is we have a lot of people on board waiting to call
home.
REED: A vessel is dropping out of warp, Captain. Twelve kilometres dead
ahead.
ARCHER: Put it up. (A sleek, flattened shape with green highlights
comes into view.) ARCHER: Look familiar?
T'POL: I don't recognise the configuration.
ARCHER: Good. Hail them. This is the Starship Enterprise. What can we
do for you? My name is Jonathan Archer. We're on a mission of
exploration from the planet Earth. Hoshi?
HOSHI: The channel's open, sir.
ARCHER: Do you need assistance? If you don't want to talk, that's fine
but, you dropped in on us. (the mystery ship turns about and goes to
warp) Was it something I said? Did you get anything on sensors?
REED: No.
ARCHER: No what?
REED: No biosigns, no propulsion or weapon signatures, no readings at
all.
 [Situation room]
 ARCHER: Are there inhabited systems nearby?
T'POL: None.
ARCHER: Why fly right up to us just to give us the silent treatment?
HOSHI: Maybe they got our signal but it didn't make any sense to them.
Our translator is far from perfect.
T'POL: I wouldn't take offense. Not every species has motives that can
be understood in human terms.
TRAVIS: Maybe they checked us out and decided we weren't very
interesting.
REED: Us? Not interesting?
ARCHER: Let's calibrate the subspace amplifier. At least the people
back home want to talk to us.
(The rest return to their Bridge stations.)
HOSHI: Sir? (quietly) I tracked them down. It took me all week.
ARCHER: Where are they?
HOSHI: Kota Baharu. It's in Malaysia.
ARCHER: What time is it there?
HOSHI: A little after nine at night.
ARCHER: That shouldn't be too late. Let's break in that new amplifier.
I'll be in my Ready Room.
 [Ready room]
 MARY REED [on monitor]: Is he all right?
ARCHER: He's fine.
STUART REED [on monitor]: Is he in some kind of trouble?
ARCHER: No, sir. Malcolm's doing a great job. I'm sure you know it's
his birthday in a couple of days.
MARY REED [on monitor]: Yes, yes, it is. September 2nd.
STUART REED [on monitor]: We haven't seen our son on his birthday for
quite a few years.
MARY REED [on monitor]: He called from San Francisco to let us know
he'd been assigned to Enterprise but we haven't heard from him since.
STUART REED [on monitor]: What are Malcolm's duties on your ship,
Captain?
ARCHER: He's my Armoury Officer.
STUART REED [on monitor]: Well, his grandfather would be pleased. He
was an ordinance officer himself in the Royal Navy.
ARCHER: It must be in Malcolm's blood.
MARY REED [on monitor]: The Reeds have been navy men for generations.
STUART REED [on monitor]: Until Malcolm decided to join Starfleet. I
suppose the ocean wasn't big enough for him.
ARCHER: He's a long way from home in any case, Mister Reed. I'd like to
do something for his birthday, make him a special dinner. I was hoping
you could tell me what he likes to eat.
MARY REED [on monitor]: Captain, Malcolm's never been comfortable
making requests.
ARCHER: I'm not sure I understand.
STUART REED [on monitor]: He always ate whatever was put in front of
him.
ARCHER: Are you saying he doesn't have a favourite food?
MARY REED [on monitor]: Not that he's ever told me.
ARCHER: Well, if you happen to think of anything you can always contact
me through Starfleet.
MARY REED [on monitor]: Give Malcolm our best.
ARCHER: I will.
STUART REED [on monitor]: Safe journey, Captain.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: How'd it go?
ARCHER: Could have gone better. Apparently, he hasn't called home since
we left Earth. I want you to find out what he likes to eat.
HOSHI: Me, sir?
ARCHER: But don't let Malcolm know.
HOSHI: Maybe this is more in Chef's area.
ARCHER: We're talking about a delicate assignment, Hoshi. It needs your
finesse.
HOSHI: Sir, I'm running a diagnostic on our subspace transceiver array.
ARCHER: Get some help if you need it, but make this a top priority.
That's an order.
HOSHI: Yes, sir.
 [Corridor]
(Archer is walking Porthos.)  ARCHER: Where were you at
dinner?
TUCKER: I ate in my quarters. Now that we've got the amplifier working
I wanted to answer a few letters.
ARCHER: You missed T'Pol's latest bout with chopsticks.
TUCKER: Damn. Dinner and a show.
ARCHER: I thought you were going to upgrade this. TUCKER: That is the upgrade.
Well if you want, I can change the colour.
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER: What's the word from home?
TUCKER: The usual, engineering updates. Oh, and Duvall got promoted.
They're giving him the Shenandoah.
ARCHER: Duvall got his own command? Thank God we're a hundred light
years away.
TUCKER: And I got a letter from Natalie.
ARCHER: The Natalie, from Pensacola?
TUCKER: Yep. Natalie from Pensacola. Looks like I've got a charge
imbalance in this manifold. I'll get right on it.
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: You know, they say long-distance relationships never work.
Well, this is about as long-distance as you can get.
ARCHER: You okay?
TUCKER: Oh, yeah. I just, I just wish I'd have had the chance to say
goodbye face to face.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER: Let me ask you something. Do you spend
much time with Malcolm?
TUCKER: I was in the Armoury yesterday for a few hours swapping out
some power relays.
ARCHER: You talk about anything interesting?
TUCKER: Power relays.
ARCHER: I talked to his parents this morning.
TUCKER: Really?
ARCHER: Yeah. (to Porthos) Sit. If I asked your parents what you like
to eat, would they be able to tell me? (They resuming walking.)
TUCKER: Are you kidding? My mom would give you her
recipe for pan-fried catfish, and wouldn't let you go till you promised
not to screw it up.
ARCHER: Malcolm's parents didn't know what his favorite food was. They
didn't even know he was an Armoury Officer.
 [Mess hall]
 TUCKER: That's strange.
ARCHER: It made me think. We don't know that much about Malcolm, do we?
(weird noise)
T'POL [OC]: Bridge to the Captain.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL: The alien vessel has returned.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Guess we weren't so uninteresting after
all.
T'POL: They dropped out of warp five hundred kilometres dead ahead.
TRAVIS: I had to reverse engines to keep from banging into them.
ARCHER: Let's try this again. (Hoshi opens a channel.) ARCHER: Welcome back. I
was hoping we'd have an opportunity to meet again. The primary mission
of my ship is to make peaceful contact with other species. If there's
anything we can do to assure you of our intentions (pauses, Hoshi
shakes her head) Well, it's been nice talking to you. Let's do this
again sometime.
HOSHI: I'm picking up something.
ARCHER: Can you translate it?
HOSHI: I don't think it's a language.
(An eardrum busting sound rips through the Bridge.)
T'POL: We're being scanned. (The green ship fires several shots as it
passes overhead.)
ARCHER: Hull plating.
REED: It's offline!
ARCHER: Hard about.
TRAVIS: They've gone to warp, sir.
ARCHER: Everybody okay?
REED: Damage reports are coming in, sir. No one's been hurt.
ARCHER: What the hell was that about?
REED: Captain, when they fired their weapon they dropped their
shielding for about two seconds and I was able to take some scans.
ARCHER: What did you get?
REED: Biosigns. At least fifteen, maybe more.
T'POL: Their DNA doesn't match anything in our database.
REED: It's a good thing they're gone. I doubt very much our torpedoes
could've penetrated their shielding.
ARCHER: Stay on long-range scanners. If they come anywhere near us, I
want to know. T'Pol.
 [Corridor]
 TUCKER: That support frame's bent. We'll need to
reinforce it. (crewman starts up with a welding torch)
ARCHER: How bad is it?
TUCKER: If that last shot had been about a half a metre higher we'd be
looking at stars.
ARCHER: (to welder) Hold it a minute.
TUCKER: There were thirteen people working in this section Captain,
including yours truly. If that bulkhead had blown.
(walking further along)
ARCHER: Did your people run into as many hostile aliens when they first
went into deep space?
T'POL: It was a different time.
ARCHER: How so?
T'POL: There were fewer warp-capable species.
ARCHER: This ship just isn't equipped to handle some of the threats
we're coming up against. It's time we do something about that.
T'POL: What are you suggesting?
ARCHER: Enterprise was fitted with phase cannon ports, but since we
left Spacedock a few weeks ahead of schedule the cannons were never
installed. (They step into a turbolift.) ARCHER: I think it's time they were. We
should head back to Earth.
 [Armoury]
 REED: Just give us two weeks, Captain.
TUCKER: I know we can do it. Most of the stuff we need is already on
the ship.
ARCHER: The armoury team at Jupiter Station is trained for this kind of
work. If we're going to do this let's do it right.
TUCKER: My engineers are just as good as they are.
ARCHER: I know that, Trip, but we have other systems that could use
overhauls. Look at the bright side. You'll got a chance to say goodbye
to Natalie. (He starts to leave.)
REED: Sir, with your permission, we could at least begin the work, get
a few things started for Jupiter Station.
TUCKER: It'll cut down the time we'll have to spend in Spacedock.
ARCHER: Do what you can. Archer to Mayweather.
TRAVIS [OC]: Go ahead, Captain.
ARCHER: We're heading home.
 [Engineering]
 (A presentation with computer graphics to a group
of the crew.)
REED: This, ladies and gentlemen is a phase-modulated energy weapon.
It's rated for a maximum power output of five hundred gigajoules.
Enterprise was designed to carry three of them. We have one, and it's
only a prototype.
TUCKER: Our job is to get it up and running and build two more from
scratch. The Captain is taking us back because he thinks this ought to
be done by the boys in Spacedock.
REED: Far be it from me to question the Captain's judgment, but
Commander Tucker and I believe we can do this ourselves.
TUCKER: That means double shifts. By the time we reach Jupiter Station,
I don't want their engineers to have a thing to do but give us a wash
and a wax. Any questions?
CREWMAN: Are we expecting another attack, sir?
TUCKER: We all signed up for this trip because we wanted to do
something no one had ever done before, not because we thought it'd be
easy or safe. But we're not here to take foolish risks. The Captain and
the rest of the crew are depending on us to keep Enterprise ready for
anything.
REED: And once we get these phase cannons online, we'll have a lot more
firepower to do just that.
TUCKER: So what are you standing around for?
 [Bridge]
 MADELINE [on monitor]: He once told me that he
loved to eat octopus, especially the little suction cups, but I think
he was pulling my leg. You can never tell whether my brother's joking
or not. Can I talk to him?
HOSHI: We really would like to keep this a surprise.
MADELINE [on monitor]: Oh right, the dinner. I remember one time, this
was at least ten years ago, he went for a whole week without eating.
HOSHI: Really?
MADELINE [on monitor]: Got by on nothing but water and a little apple
juice.
HOSHI: Why?
MADELINE [on monitor]: Some sort of survival training. Or was it a
contest?
HOSHI: When he started eating again, do you remember the first thing he
wanted?
MADELINE [on monitor]: He was so weak he could barely get out of bed.
For two days all he had was protein concentrate.
HOSHI: When you two were growing up he never said, hey, let's go out
for pizza, boy, I'd love some Indian food?
MADELINE [on monitor]: Not that I remember. Malcolm isn't the easiest
person to get to know.
HOSHI: I'm figuring that out.
LATRELLE [on monitor]: When we were training in San Francisco there was
a little restaurant on the Embarcadero he liked to go to. They had a
specialty, some kind of fish, I think.
HOSHI: What kind? Halibut? Swordfish?
LATRELLE [on monitor]: No.
HOSHI: Mahi-mahi? Scallops?
LATRELLE [on monitor]: I had sea bass.
HOSHI: Great! And Malcolm?
LATRELLE [on monitor]: I don't remember.
HOSHI: Try, please.
LATRELLE [on monitor]: Maureen.
HOSHI: Is that a fish?
LATRELLE [on monitor]: No, she was the waitress. That's why Malcolm
wanted to go there. He had a thing for her. I think he hates fish.
HOSHI: Thanks.
TRAVIS: So how's your secret mission coming?
HOSHI: I've talked to his sister, his best friend, his Uncle Archie,
his two spinster aunts. The most anyone seems to know about his eating
habits is that he occasionally eats.
T'POL: Ensign, if you want to know something about Mister Reed perhaps
you should ask him.
 {Mess hall}
 HOSHI: Anyone sitting here?
REED: Er, no. Please. (He carries on working on two PADDS while eating.)
HOSHI: This is the first chance I've had to eat all day.
REED: Tell me about it. I haven't set foot outside the Armoury since oh
seven hundred.
HOSHI: How's your ravioli?
REED: It's fine.
HOSHI: Nothing like a nice plate of pasta. You know, I used to love to
cook but I never get a chance to anymore, and the way that Chef
protects the galley. One of these nights, I should fix something
myself.
REED: (not paying attention) I'm sorry?
HOSHI: You'd love my enchiladas.
REED: Enchiladas?
HOSHI: If you don't like them, I can fix something else. What's your
favourite food?
REED: I appreciate the offer, but it really isn't necessary.
HOSHI: Aren't you getting a little tired of having to eat whatever Chef
happens to serve?
REED: No, he's a fine cook.
HOSHI: Don't get me wrong. He's terrific. It's just that dinner in the
Mess Hall can lack a certain personal touch. I've got a hot plate in my
quarters.
REED: That's very flattering. I'm just not sure it would be
appropriate.
HOSHI: What do you mean?
REED: Well, we work together and it just might be a little awkward,
Serving on the same ship.
HOSHI: What does that have to do with? (enlightenment arrives) Oh! No,
I didn't, I didn't mean to imply anything other than just making
dinner, Lieutenant. (Hoshi stands to leave.)
REED: Well, then, it's my mistake then.
HOSHI: No, it's my fault. I shouldn't have. Yeah, I'll just.
REED: No, please, finish your dinner.
HOSHI: No, no, no, you've got a lot of work to do, so. (Hoshi leaves with her
tray.)
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Captain, I'm detecting a ship dead astern.
Eight thousand metres.
ARCHER: Let me guess. Our shadow?
T'POL: Closing to seven thousand. Six thousand.
ARCHER: Polarise the hull plating. (The ship shakes under the attack.)
 [Mess hall]
 REED: Reed to Bridge. (no reply) Armoury, report.
Get to your stations. Move.
 [Bridge]
 (Half lights, displays flashing on and off.)
T'POL: Warp drive is offline. (Everything goes black.) T'POL: Main power is
down.
ARCHER: Torpedoes.
T'POL: Tactical systems are down.
ARCHER: Why don't you save time and tell me what isn't down?
T'POL: The outer doors in Launch Bay two are opening.
ARCHER: Seal them.
T'POL: I can't.
(Archer leaves the Bridge.)
 [Corridor]
 (Two men working by flashlight see a pair of pale
skinned humanoids with very long legs cross a junction. They follow,
then their flashlights fall to the floor. Archer and his two security
guards come across the weird aliens crouching over the crewmen doing
something strange with beams coming from their hands.)
ARCHER: Get away from those men! (Archer fires his phase pistol, no effect on
the big eyed alien with a vertical mouth slit and no nose. The aliens
leave and the security guards follow.) ARCHER: Go. Archer to Sickbay.
PHLOX [OC]: Phlox here, Captain.
ARCHER: Report to E deck, section seven. This is an emergency.
PHLOX [OC]: On my way.
CREWMAN [OC]: Security to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
CREWMAN [OC]: The aliens are gone, sir. They've launched their shuttle.
(Another salvo at a nacelle and the green ship leaves.)
ARCHER: Bridge, report!
T'POL [OC]: The alien vessel has gone to warp, but that last shot
damaged our port nacelle. We're venting drive plasma.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: Doctor?
PHLOX: I've stabilised them, but they were subjected to some rather
invasive scans.
ARCHER: Will they be all right? (Both men are just staring at the
ceiling.)
PHLOX: There could be some residual neurological damage, but I'm doing
everything I can.
ARCHER: Have you ever heard of anything like this?
T'POL: No.
ARCHER: Are there any Vulcan records of a species that uses similar
tactics? And I don't care how classified they might be.
T'POL: None that I know of, Captain.
ARCHER: Find out what you can.
TUCKER [OC]: Tucker to Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
TUCKER [OC]: We've got the plasma leak
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Under control, but our port nacelle took a
lot of damage.
ARCHER [OC]: How long before we can go to warp?
TUCKER: A couple of days.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: What about impulse power?
TUCKER [OC]: That's the good news.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: It should be back online in a few minutes.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: I'll take all the good news I can get.
Keep me posted, Doctor.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: There are no Vulcan ships within scanning
range.
TRAVIS: Sir, we could try to contact the Vulcan High Command. They're
only two days away at warp six. I'm sure they'd give us a hand.
ARCHER: I'm sure they would. (Archer nods to Hoshi.)
HOSHI: I can't raise Vulcan. It's funny. I ran a diagnostic after the
attack, but now Echo Two won't respond.
T'POL: That's because it isn't there.
ARCHER: What?
T'POL: There's nothing but debris at the co-ordinates where we deployed
the amplifier.
ARCHER: What about Echo One?
T'POL: Destroyed as well.
  [Armoury]
 CREWMAN: The stabiliser on cannon port two checks
out okay, sir.
REED: Port two or port one?
CREWMAN: Port one, sir. Sorry.
REED: Get it right. Start on those beam emitters.
CREWMAN: Yes, sir.
TUCKER: Targeting scanners will be online in an hour.
REED: We should be aligning them by now, not installing them.
 [Jefferies tube]
 TUCKER: You were a little hard on Eddie.
Everyone's busting their tails to get this job done. (Reed gets an electric shock.)
REED: Ow!
TUCKER: You okay?
REED: Yeah, fine. I told them to depolarise these relays!
TUCKER: What were you trying to do?
REED: Bypass the EPS grid.
TUCKER: Why?
REED: Well, we could draw power for the cannons directly from the
impulse engines.
TUCKER: Are you trying to make this blow up in your face?
REED: The relays were rated to handle that much power.
TUCKER: What if there's a surge?
REED: I've thought of that. These inverters were designed to cut in at
the first sign of an overload.
TUCKER: We've got to do this by the book, or we'll end up blowing a
bigger hole in ourselves than the bad guys.
REED: I've run a dozen simulations. It's an acceptable risk.
TUCKER: When it comes to modifying ship systems, why don't you let the
Chief Engineer decide what's an acceptable risk?
REED: Sir, if we do this by the book, those aliens are likely to be
back before we're done.
TUCKER: I want to get this job done as quickly as you do, Lieutenant,
but not if it means taking shortcuts that could get our people killed.
REED: Yes, sir.
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER: Don't you ever rest?
TUCKER: You know, I can't sleep without the warp engines online. If I
don't feel those vibrations, something just doesn't seem right.
ARCHER: Well, I hope you get them fixed soon because you look like
hell.
TUCKER: Well, with all due respect, Captain, you shouldn't be talking.
ARCHER: How's it coming?
TUCKER: It'll be online by the end of the day tomorrow, guaranteed.
Could you check the dilithium alignment for me?
ARCHER: Sure. Point oh six microns. At least we'll be flying home under
our own power.
TUCKER: Let me know if it drops below point oh three.
ARCHER: I tried to get a message to the Vulcan High Command, but it
didn't go through. If it had, we'd be expecting a Surak class ship
tomorrow, oh so politely offering to help us.
TUCKER: Well, the Vulcans would have loved that. Towing the pride of
Starfleet back to base.
ARCHER: Maybe we should thank our visitors for blowing up the subspace
amplifiers. It's holding at point oh five.
TUCKER: Keep an eye on it.
ARCHER: You looking forward to seeing Earth?
TUCKER: Sure. I just didn't think I'd be seeing it so soon.
ARCHER: This time, we won't be leaving before we're ready.
TUCKER: Are your ears a little pointier than usual?
ARCHER: I nev (He pauses as crewman walks past.) ARCHER: I never said we didn't
belong out here. I just wish we'd have launched with all our systems
online, especially weapons.
TUCKER: If we hadn't launched when we did, they'd have sent Klaang back
to Kronos in a box.
ARCHER: I keep reminding myself of that. But I rushed us out of
Spacedock because I had something to prove, and I risked the lives of
eighty one humans, a Vulcan, and a Denobulan to do it.
TUCKER: Don't forget Porthos.
ARCHER: Thanks.
TUCKER: In the old days, astronauts rode rockets with millions of
litres of hydrogen burning under their seats. You think they said, gee
I'd love to go to the moon today but it seems a little risky? I think
if you asked anyone on board whether they thought this mission was
worth the risk you'd get the same answer from every one of them.
ARCHER: Let me know when we're ready to go to warp.
TUCKER: Aye, sir.
 [Cannon port one]
 TUCKER: Have you still got those guns of yours
hooked up to the impulse engines?
REED: I'm just disconnecting them now.
TUCKER: Hang on a minute. You're sure this'll work?
REED: Yes, Commander, I am.
TUCKER: Then based on the recommendation of the Armoury officer, the
Chief Engineer finds the level of risk acceptable.
REED: In that case, if the Chief Engineer wouldn't mind getting his
hands dirty, I could use some help.
 Captain's starlog, September 1, 2151. It's been
two days now with no sign of the alien vessel.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: My crew has managed to do in forty eight
hours what would've taken the armoury team at Jupiter Station at least
a week. To say that I'm proud of them would be an understatement. We're
preparing our first test. Everybody has their fingers crossed,
including me.
 [Bridge]
(There is a crater-pocked asteroid on
viewscreen.)  ARCHER: You're sure there's nothing down there?
T'POL: Yes, Captain.
ARCHER: Not even a microbe? I don't want to blow up something that
could evolve into a sentient species in a couple of billion years.
T'POL: There's nothing there.
ARCHER: Archer to Lieutenant Reed. Have you got a lock?
REED [OC]: Yes, Captain.
ARCHER: Let's start small. Shave a couple of metres off the top of that
peak.
 [Armoury]
 REED: Acquiring the target. Full power to the
primary coils. (hatches open on the underside of the saucer and the
cannons emerge) Phase cannons one and two standing by.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Mister Reed, the honour is all yours. (two
cannon beams turn the mountain into a crater and blow a few circuits) I
just asked for a little off the top.
 [Armoury]
 REED: Check the cannons. Be careful down there.
The blast yield was ten times what we expected.
ARCHER [OC]: What happened?
REED: Something overloaded the phase modulators.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER: The plasma recoil blew out relays across
decks C and D.
T'POL: I'm getting an anomalous reading from Launch Bay two.
ARCHER: Trip, T'Pol.
 [Launch bay 2]
 (Reed, Archer and Tucker enter cautiously, phase
pistols drawn. T'Pol follows with a scanner. Tucker spots round object by upper walkway.)
TUCKER: There. What's that?
ARCHER: You think that's what's causing the power surge?
T'POL: It's very likely. It's putting out a tremendous amount of
energy. Over six hundred megajoules.
REED: They're toying with us. They want us to know they can destroy us
whenever they want, even with our own weapons.
T'POL: Whatever it is, it's tapped into most of our systems including
internal sensors and communications on every deck. (Archer is at a wall panel.)
ARCHER: Activate visual sensor J-15. I assume you
planted that device because you wanted to learn more about us. (We see
him from the viewpoint of an observer via a camera.) ARCHER: I'll be happy to
give you a quick lesson. We're not here to make enemies, but just
because we're not looking for a fight doesn't mean we'll run away from
one. You may think you've left us defenceless, but let me tell you
something about humans. We don't give up easily. We'll protect
Enterprise any way we can. (He destroys the round object.)
 [Sickbay]
 HOSHI: Doctor?
PHLOX: I'll be with you in a moment, Ensign.
HOSHI: I see you released your patients.
PHLOX: They're going to be fine. I sent them back to their quarters to
rest.
HOSHI: That's good to hear.
PHLOX: What can I do for you?
HOSHI You spend a lot of time in the Mess Hall. Have you ever had a
meal with Lieutenant Reed?
PHLOX: Many times.
HOSHI: Any idea what his favourite food might be?
PHLOX: Ah, the birthday dinner. Well, the man loves a good breakfast.
HOSHI: Like what?
PHLOX: Eggs, I've seen him eat a lot of eggs.
HOSHI: How does he like them?
PHLOX: Scrambled, poached, over easy.
HOSHI: Maybe Chef could make him a big omelette.
PHLOX: Oh, and he enjoys pancakes, on occasion. He has the odd habit of
spreading peanut butter on them. Sausage, that's another favourite.
Bacon too, come to think of it.
HOSHI: Is there any one food in particular?
PHLOX: Not that I recall.
HOSHI: Breaking a Vulcan encryption code would be easier than this.
PHLOX: If anything comes to mind, I'll let you know.
HOSHI: I don't suppose scanning his taste buds would help?
PHLOX: Medically speaking, there's no accounting for taste.
HOSHI: Thanks anyways.
PHLOX: Bromelin!
HOSHI: Sorry?
PHLOX: I think I can help you, Ensign, but it would mean going into
Mister Reed's medical record. That information is confidential.
HOSHI: I'm under direct orders from the Captain. Couldn't you make an
exception?
PHLOX: Under the circumstances, I suppose it wouldn't hurt. I've made
it a point to study each crewman's medical history, and I remember
noticing that Lieutenant Reed suffers from a number of allergies. Let's
see. Dust mites, oak pollen, tropical grasses. Ah ha ha, here it is.
He's averse to various plant enzymes, including bromelin.
HOSHI: What does all of this have to do with what he likes to eat?
PHLOX: Over the last several years he's been taking regular injections
so that his body can tolerate bromelin.
HOSHI: A plant enzyme.
PHLOX: Yes.
HOSHI: Found in?
PHLOX: Among other things, pineapple.
HOSHI: Pineapple! (She dashes for the door.)
PHLOX: This doesn't mean it's his favourite food.
HOSHI: It's close enough. Thank you, Doctor.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: It's them.
ARCHER: Where are they?
T'POL: Closing from astern, twenty thousand metres. Fifteen.
TRAVIS: Should I try evasive manoeuvres?
ARCHER: No. Come about, and hold our position. Bridge to the Armoury.
Guess who's back.
 [Armoury]
 REED: We see them. Both forward cannons are
charged and ready.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Get a lock and standby.
T'POL: They've stopped. Eleven thousand metres.
HOSHI: We're being hailed.
ARCHER: Put it through.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: Defenceless. (The image we saw in the launch
bay.) ARCHER [on viewscreen]: Prepare to surrender your vessel. You are defenseless. Prepare to
surrender your vessel.
ARCHER: Shut it off.
TRAVIS: Ten thousand metres, nine.
ARCHER: Mister Reed, both cannons, fire. (Two beams scrape along the
green ship's shields.)
T'POL: I'm reading a fluctuation in their shielding, but it's marginal.
TRAVIS: Five thousand metres.
ARCHER: Is that the best we can do, Lieutenant?!
 [Armoury]
 REED: Even if these cannons had been installed at
Jupiter Station, they wouldn't be any more effective than they are now.
ARCHER: What about yesterday? I saw you blow something up the size of
Mount McKinley.
REED: Yes sir, but that was due to an overload.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Can you overload them again?
 [Armoury]
 REED: Sir, after the damage from the first time
the plasma recoil would probably knock out two decks.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Can you overload them again?
 [Armoury]
 REED: I believe so.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: I'd rather knock out two decks than
surrender this ship.
 [Armoury]
 REED: But sir.
TUCKER: Hold on a minute. I think there's a way to handle the recoil.
 [Bridge]
 REED [OC]: How?
TUCKER [OC]: All that excess energy's got to go somewhere.
 [Armoury]
 TUCKER: Why not put it to use?
TRAVIS [OC]: Three thousand metres.
TUCKER: If we repolarise the gravity plating to absorb the recoil,
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER [OC]: Then we can shunt the energy to
structural integrity.
ARCHER: Sounds good to me.
 [Armoury]
 REED: The grav-plating wasn't designed
 [Bridge]
 REED [OC]: To withstand that much force.
ARCHER: We all understand the risks. Get started.
REED [OC]: Aye, sir.
TRAVIS: One thousand metres.
ARCHER: Malcolm?
 [Armoury]
 REED: Stand by. Trip? We're ready, sir.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Then fire! (Two beams scrape the ship,
their shields ripple and fall, a couple of explosions are seen.)
T'POL: (Enterprise rocks too) Their shields are failing.
ARCHER: Torpedoes! (Two hits to the aft of the ship and it turns away,
trailing smoke or whatever.) ARCHER: Bridge to the Armoury. Everything okay down
there?
 [Armoury]
 TUCKER: We blew out the plasma relays on B deck
but it's nothing we can't take care of. What about our friends?
ARCHER [OC]: I have a feeling
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Their repairs are going to be a little
more extensive.
 [Armoury]
 ARCHER [OC]: How'd the cannons hold up?
REED: Fairly well.
 [Bridge]
 REED [OC]: I'll have them back online within the
hour.
 [Armoury]
 REED: The aft cannon should be working by the end
of day tomorrow.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Good work. Well, I see no reason for us to
go back to Jupiter Station now. Do you?
T'POL: No.
HOSHI: At least there's one good thing about coming back this far. We
can drop another subspace amplifier.
ARCHER: Get on it. Travis, resume our previous course.
TRAVIS: Gladly, sir.
 [Armoury]
 TUCKER: To our mysterious friends. I wish I
could've seen the looks on their faces. (The clink of beer glasses.)
REED and ARCHER: Hear, hear.
ARCHER: Don't get too used to drinking on duty. But you did your jobs
pretty damn well yesterday. I'd say that deserves a little celebration.
REED: Cheers.
TUCKER: If you really want to thank us, how about letting us sleep in
tomorrow?
ARCHER: Permission granted. Hoshi, what can we do for you? (Hoshi is carrying a large case.)
HOSHI: Sorry to interrupt, Captain. I have that
component that you asked for.
ARCHER: Great, put it down right here. (opens it up) As long as we've
got you here, Malcolm. (He displays an iced cake with pink lettering.) ARCHER: Happy
birthday.
REED: You shouldn't have gone to any trouble.
ARCHER: Oh, no trouble at all. (Archer offers the cake slice to Reed.) ARCHER: Mister Reed, the
honour is yours. (Reed cuts a corner of the cake and looks at the filling.)
REED:  Pineapple! That's my
favourite. How on Earth did you know?
HOSHI: We have our sources.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Dear Doctor
Dear
Doctor
 Original Airdate: 23 Jan, 2002
  [Sickbay]
 (Phlox enters and switches on the lights.)
PHLOX: Good morning, everyone. Be patient. (The menagerie awakes and
starts chirping, rustling and making general living noises as he goes
around feeding them.) PHLOX: Ah! Someone had a busy night. (He picks up a small
egg, drops in some meat, a clawed arm reaches from the sand and drags
it down.) PHLOX: Don't worry. I didn't forget you. (He removes cover from case and
offers a green caterpillar to the occupant.) PHLOX: Now, Let's try it without
biting my fingers this time. (Phlox eats the second one himself.  Later, Hoshi enters bearing a PADD.)
HOSHI: People are getting jealous. You get more
letters from home than anyone on this ship. What's her name?
PHLOX: It's nothing like that. They're from Doctor Lucas. He's a
colleague from the Interspecies Medical Exchange.
HOSHI: I didn't know there were humans serving on Denobula.
PHLOX: He's the first. He helped me get settled in when I came to San
Francisco. I'm trying to return the favour.
HOSHI: I had a pen pal once when I was twelve, from Brisbane,
Australia, and I loved getting her letters. It was like this little
window into distant places with strange sounding names.
PHLOX: The curiosity of an explorer, even then.
HOSHI: Are we still on for later?
PHLOX: Oh, yes. I'm looking forward to it. If you think you're ready,
we can tackle gerunds today.
HOSHI: I can hardly wait. (Hoshi leaves. Phlox sits down to listen to his
letter.)
LUCAS [OC]: My dear Doctor Phlox, it's me again, Jeremy. I hope you are
well. It's been a hell of a week here. Wall to wall emergencies and
three midnight deliveries. It's mating season, so you know how that
goes. I thought human reproduction was complicated. You Denobulans make
us look like single-cell organisms.
 PHLOX [OC]: Dear Doctor Lucas, sorry to hear about
your difficult week. I know the rigours of mating season only too well.
It might help to bear in mind that a dose of niaxilin can be quite
effective in separating the two combatants. It sounds like you've
settled into your new living quarters. That part of the city has some
very lively Kaybin bars along the river.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Up here, Doc!
PHLOX [OC]: They're open all night, if I recall. Please, don't venture
inside them unescorted. They can be quite disturbing to the
uninitiated. (There is an injured crewman on the upper walkway.)
TUCKER: He was trying
to reroute a nitrogen valve and the seal blew. How bad is it? (Phlox checks the man's head and hand.)
PHLOX: Oh, it's superficial. Only first degree
burns. A little dermoline gel should do the trick.
 PHLOX [OC]: Most of my work is fairly routine.
Scrapes and bruises, the occasional emergency. And you'll be pleased to
hear that the crew finally seems to be growing accustomed to an alien
doctor on board. I must admit, I wasn't planning to stay this long but
the opportunity to observe your species on their first deep space
venture has proven irresistible.
 [Mess hall]
 PHLOX: Lieutenant, I saved a seat for you.
REED: Yeah, another time, Doctor. I'm due back in the Armoury.
 PHLOX [OC]: It's a bit daunting at times, trying
to socialise with the crew, form friendships, but our profession
guarantees that sooner or later everyone comes to see us. It makes
interaction quite a bit easier.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: It's just a little gastrointestinal
distress.
ARCHER: He hasn't been himself lately. (Archer strokes Porthos.)
PHLOX: Well, you've been feeding him cheese again, haven't you? You've
got to learn how to say no, Captain.
ARCHER: No more dairy products, you hear that? Doctor's orders.
PHLOX [OC]: I never thought I'd meet a species that forges such
intimate bonds with lesser creatures. It's surprising the things you
humans choose to invest your emotions in.
ARCHER: Sorry to bother you with this.
PHLOX: No bother. He was one of my more co-operative patients today.
ARCHER: Thanks, Doc. (to Porthos) See all the trouble you cause?
 PHLOX [OC]: I've noticed how the captain seems to
anthropomorphise his pet. He even talks to the creature although I'm
fairly certain it has no idea what he's saying. Then again, I've been
known to speak to my Pyrithian bat on occasion.
 [Mess hall]
 (It's movie night - For Whom The Bell Tolls, 1943,
starring Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman.)
ROBERT [on screen]: We won't be going to America this time, but always
I go with you wherever you go. Understand? You go now, Maria.
MARIA [on screen]: No. I stay with you, Roberto.
ROBERT [on screen]: No, Maria. What I do now, I do alone. I couldn't do
it if you were here. If you go, then I go, too. Don't you see how it
is? Whichever one there is.
MARIA [on screen]: No! No!
CUTLER: (seeing Phlox looking around) We can go if you're bored.
PHLOX: No, no. I'd like to stay and see what happens.
CUTLER: You won't be disappointed. The ending's classic.
PHLOX: No, not the film. I'm sensing a rising emotional undercurrent in
the room. I'm curious to see if it culminates in some kind of group
response.
CUTLER: They don't have movies where you come from, do they?
PHLOX: We had something similar a few hundred years ago, but they lost
their appeal when people discovered their real lives were more
interesting.
CUTLER: Still, it's nice to take a break from real life every now and
then, don't you think?
PHLOX: I suppose it is. (Phlox takes popcorn.)
ROBERT [on screen]: I am you now, and you are me. Now you understand
and you're going well and fast and far (Tucker realises Phlox has spotted him crying.)
TUCKER: Something in my eye.
ROBERT [on screen]: Stand up now and go and we both go. Stand up,
Maria. Remember, you're me too.
 PHLOX [OC]: It's remarkable, Doctor. Even
fictional characters seem to elicit human compassion. My shipmates have
calmly faced any number of dangers, and yet a simple movie can bring
tears to their eyes.
 [Corridor]
 PHLOX: Temporal vein.
CUTLER: Temporal vein. Internal maxillary.
PHLOX: And what is the maxillary connected to?
CUTLER: Posterior auricular?
PHLOX: Very good. The external jugular.
CUTLER: Oh, er, superior vena cava.
PHLOX: And that leads to?
CUTLER: Oh, easy. The seat of all joy and sadness.
PHLOX: Physiologically, it is nothing more than a very efficient pump.
What could possibly make you people think it is the source of all
emotion?
CUTLER: You know, you may know about our cardiopulmonary system, but
you have a lot to learn about the human heart. (gestures to door) This
is me.
PHLOX: Good night. (Phlox starts to walk away.)
CUTLER: Oh, Doctor. I just wanted to thank you. It was fun tonight.
PHLOX: You're welcome.
CUTLER: Er, they're showing another one next week. Sunset Boulevard. I
think you might like it.
PHLOX: I'm sure I will. (Cutler puts her hand on his shoulder.)
CUTLER: See you tomorrow? Oh, sorry. I
forgot Denobulans don't like to be touched.
PHLOX: It's all right. I'm trying to shed some of my cultural
inhibitions.
CUTLER: Oh, in that case. (She gives him a kiss on the cheek.) CUTLER: Good night.
(Cutler goes into her quarters, Phlox walks on.)
 PHLOX [OC]: Since we were on the subject of
mating, I think Crewman Cutler may be romantically interested in me. I
can't be certain, however. The pheromones of human females aren't as
potent as Denobulans'.
 [Bridge]
 (A spaceship hangs motionless in the middle of the
viewscreen.)
ARCHER: Are there any inhabited systems nearby?
T'POL: There's a Minshara class planet less than a light year away.
HOSHI: The ship's not answering our hails, Captain.
REED: It's definitely pre-warp, sir. It could be unmanned. Maybe a
probe of some kind.
ARCHER: Any biosigns?
T'POL: Two, but they're very faint.
ARCHER: Bring it into Launch Bay two, and tell Doctor Phlox he might
have a couple of patients.
 [Sickbay]
 (They revive a humanoid with pronounced bones
around the eye sockets and forehead.)
ARCHER: We found your ship adrift. We thought we might be able to help.
ALIEN: Trenakadula ta? Morana dona?
HOSHI: I need a little more.
ARCHER: I'm Jonathan Archer. You're on the Starship Enterprise.
ALIEN: Kandala vaganish. Yoreta vala? (Hoshi nods.)
ARCHER: Can you understand me?
ALIEN: Who are you? What planet?
ARCHER: Earth. We're from Earth.
ALIEN: This is a warp vessel?
ARCHER: Yes.
ALIEN: We left Valakis over a year ago, along with three other ships.
ARCHER: Why?
ALIEN: You must have noticed our condition by now.
PHLOX: I detected the illness.
ALIEN: Twelve million of us died the year before we left. I can only
imagine how many have died since. Our doctors can't find a cure, but a
more advanced people, people with warp technology, like you, your
medical science must be more effective.
T'POL: You've encountered other warp-capable species?
ALIEN: The M'klexa and the Ferengi. They both visited our world. Do you
know them?
T'POL: No.
ALIEN: Are you the ship's doctor?
PHLOX: I am.
ALIEN: My people are dying. Will you allow him to help us?
(Archer and T'Pol walk away a little to discuss.)
ARCHER: Any thoughts?
T'POL: They did come looking for us, and considering they've already
met two other warp-capable species the risk of contamination seems
acceptable.
ARCHER: (to Phlox) See what you can do.
ALIEN: Thank you.
 PHLOX [OC]: If this letter arrives later than
usual, Doctor, I hope you'll forgive me. I've been presented with a
rather unusual case involving a pair of alien astronauts. It may not
surprise you that they landed in my Sickbay through an act of human
compassion. I said before that my duties entail the occasional
emergency. Emergencies, it seems, come in all shapes and sizes. I was
once nearly overwhelmed by fifty patients in a refugee camp on Matalas.
Captain Archer is now asking me to take responsibility for over fifty
million.
 [Mess hall]
 HOSHI: (in Denobulan) How are your patients?
PHLOX: (in Denobulan) Their condition is grave, but they're resting for
now.
HOSHI: (in Denobulan) I'm sure you'll find a way to help them.
PHLOX: (in Denobulan) Your syntax is improving. Continue.
HOSHI: (in Denobulan) Do you like the food?
PHLOX: (in Denobulan) The sauce is good but I don't care for this
vegetable.
HOSHI: (in Denobulan) Eggplant's not a vegetable, it's a nostril.
PHLOX: It's a nostril?
HOSHI: (in Denobulan) A fruit. (in English) I've noticed you and
Crewman Cutler spending a lot of time together. Is there something
going on between you two?
PHLOX: In Denobulan, please.
HOSHI: (in Denobulan) Are you two mating?
PHLOX: I believe the word you're searching for is dating. (He gives it in
Denobulan.)
HOSHI: Well, are you? (She speaks in Denobulan, but is having to use her PADD for
reference.) HOSHI: Well, are you?
PHLOX: (in Denobulan) I'm not exactly sure.
HOSHI: There are ways you can tell. (in Denobulan) Does she want to
spend time with you? Does she find excuses to (in English) to make
physical contact?
PHLOX: Well, she did kiss me on the cheek the other night.
HOSHI: In Denobulan, Doctor.
PHLOX: (in Denobulan) Do you have any advice?
HOSHI: (in Denobulan) I think you make a very cute washboard.
PHLOX: I beg your pardon?
HOSHI: Couple. A cute couple.
 [Bridge]
 REED: It's pretty crowded out there. A lot of
spacecraft and artificial satellites.
TRAVIS: Nothing I can't avoid, sir.
ARCHER: Put us in a low orbit, Travis. They're expecting us.
 PHLOX [OC]: The Captain has committed all our
resources to helping people he didn't even know existed two days ago.
Once again, I am struck by your species' desire to help others.
 [Hospital Ward]
 ESAAK: It seems the more aggressively we treat the
illness the more resistant it becomes.
PHLOX: What's the current rate of infection?
ESAAK: One out of three.
ARCHER: It's a full blown epidemic.
ESAAK: These are in the most advanced stage. (Phlox checks the apparatus.)
PHLOX: You're treating them with a synthetic
antibody?
ESAAK: It's effective at first, but the disease mutates. Once it moves
into the respiratory system there's no way of controlling it. Pulmonary
failure usually follows in a few days.
PHLOX: Captain, treatment with priaxate should ease the symptoms in the
sickest patients, at least temporarily. I can easily show the Valakians
how to synthesize as much as they need.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
PHLOX: I'll need all of the lab work you have, and case histories of
patients in every stage of the disease.
ESAAK: Certainly. (The group moves off, but Hoshi stays behind to check
on one of the astronauts.)
HOSHI: Excuse me. We're the ones that brought him here. Can you tell me
how he's doing?
LARR: Dak mul ahna.
HOSHI: I'm sorry. Could you say that again?
(As Phlox and the doctor discuss medicine.)
T'POL: We should assign some crewmen to watch Doctor Phlox and his
equipment.
ARCHER: I don't think these people are about to steal anything.
T'POL: Your experience with lesser civilisations is limited, Captain.
You might be surprised what a temptation our technology can be.
(She overhears Hoshi's young man.)
LARR: Dak mul ahna. Kal ah ku dah.
ARCHER: Hoshi?
HOSHI: Captain, the UT can't translate his language.
ESAAK: Dukat ah pra kee, Larr. (Larr bows and leaves them.)
HOSHI: He doesn't speak the same language as you?
ESAAK: No, he's Menk. They're not as evolved as Valakians but they're
very hard workers.
ARCHER: They're indigenous to this planet?
ESAAK: Is that so strange?
ARCHER: On most of the planets we've encountered, only one species of
humanoids survived the evolutionary process.
ESAAK: You two are not from the same planet?
T'POL: No. We may look alike, but the similarity ends there.
PHLOX: I don't see any Menk patients here. Where are they being
treated?
ESAAK: They haven't contracted the disease.
PHLOX: Have you looked into their immunity?
ESAAK: It was one of the first things we pursued, but Menk and Valakian
are physiologically incompatible.
PHLOX: Still, could be significant. I'd like to see your data on the
Menk as well.
ESAAK: Of course.
 PHLOX [OC]: I had meant to transmit this letter by
now but the Valakian epidemic has been taking up most of my time.
Working with the physicians here has been quite fulfilling. I suppose
it's the reason we joined the Interspecies Medical Exchange, but I
worry about falsely raising their hopes. Despite Captain Archer's
confidence in me I'm afraid the scale of the disaster may outweigh our
best intentions. I've decided to enlist Crewman Cutler's help in my
task.
 [Sickbay]
(Cutler helps to pack medical supplies.)  CUTLER: So what
are the Menk like?
PHLOX: You'll have the chance to see for yourself. You're a trained
exobiologist. I'd find your assistance in the field invaluable.
CUTLER: Thank you, Doctor.
PHLOX [OC]: On a personal note, the affection Crewman Cutler is showing
has left me a bit perplexed, so I've decided to discuss it with the one
person on board who might understand the complexities of the situation.
(Later, T'Pol is on a biobed.)
T'POL: That's impossible.
PHLOX: It's nothing to be ashamed of.
T'POL: My teeth were sealed with a tri-fluorinate compound twenty three
years ago.
PHLOX: Well, normal wear and tear has allowed some decay to sneak in.
See for yourself. There, on your anterior tricuspid. (T'Pol gets up.)
T'POL: I'm sure you have more pressing concerns. I'll come
back later.
PHLOX: I'm waiting for the computer to analyse some tissue samples.
It'll only take a moment to repair. (T'Pol lies down again.) PHLOX: Open,
please. Wider. You've lived among humans for quite some time now,
Sub-commander. I'm curious, have you ever known them to mate outside
their species? Ah! There it is.
T'POL: Are you asking out of personal interest or scientific curiosity?
PHLOX: Both, I suppose. There's a crewman on board I've become close
with. I think she's attracted to me.
T'POL: In my experience, humans lack the emotional maturity for
interspecies relationships. They tend to be easily infatuated with
things they find new. This crewman may simply be satisfying her
curiosity at your expense.
PHLOX: Open.
PHLOX [OC]: Sub-commander T'Pol has a very pragmatic feel of the
universe. I admire her logic although she lacks the instinctiveness
that a more emotional response can provide. Somehow, I find this
unsettling.
PHLOX: There. That wasn't so bad. Thanks for your insights.
T'POL: Be careful.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in.
PHLOX: You asked to see me, Captain?
ARCHER: I've just gotten a call from the director of the clinic. He's
eager to hear if you've made any progress. Doctor?
PHLOX: I've developed a medication to ease the symptoms of the disease,
but
ARCHER: But?
PHLOX: This epidemic isn't being caused by a virus or bacteria. The
proteins that bind to their chromosomes are deteriorating. Their
illness is genetic. It's been going on for thousands of years, but the
rate of mutation has accelerated over the last few generations. Based
on my projections, the Valakians will be extinct in less than two
centuries. I wish I had better news.
ARCHER: What about a cure?
PHLOX: Genetic abnormalities on this level are very difficult to
reverse.
ARCHER: But not impossible.
PHLOX: No. I still believe the Menk immunity could be the key to a
cure. I plan to study them in more detail.
ARCHER: Take all the time you need.
 PHLOX [OC]: When I began to practice medicine I
had no idea it would take me on journeys to other worlds. Every species
I encounter allows me to explore a new physiology. At the moment, I
find myself in the enviable position of studying two humanoids from the
same planet. It's a rare and exciting opportunity.
 [Menk village]
 (A simple rustic village in the woods.)
PHLOX: Tell them we'd like to run some tests, take samples of their
blood. It will be completely painless.
HOSHI: Kuhl toh bah.
LARR: Kuhl pra toh bah aren so l'tee.
MENK: Ylyn parum ta see ettaj.
HOSHI: He's says they'd be happy to help.
PHLOX [OC]: As fascinating as the two species are from a biological
standpoint, it's their ability to co-exist that intrigues me the most.
The Valakians are highly evolved, technologically advanced, while the
Menk are relatively primitive by comparison. To my surprise, the two
seem to be living side by side, peacefully.
(A little later, Cutler and Phlox are gathering samples.)
HOSHI: Pra du matta.
LARR: Pra ducat matta ku mampah. (Phlox is scanning Menk.)
MENK: Koh utah?
HOSHI: He wants to know what you're doing.
PHLOX: Have you learned enough Menk to explain a molecular bio scan?
HOSHI: Doctor, er, esatta prah koo kuvalakii.
CUTLER: What'd you say?
HOSHI: I told him the Doctor was looking inside of him.
CUTLER: Thank you.
HOSHI: Tik tik.
MENK: Nan dah.
HOSHI: You're welcome.
LARR: Neek. Rasata. Food.
CUTLER: Did he just say food?
LARR: Rasata. Food.
PHLOX: Have you been teaching him English?
HOSHI: No, he must have picked it up by listening to us.
PHLOX: Perhaps we've found an assistant comm. officer.
LARR: No food?
HOSHI: Tik tik.
LARR: Tik tik.
PHLOX: I haven't seen any crops or livestock. I wonder where they get
this.
HOSHI: Larr, ku rasata gol dach?
LARR: Pah ku mano. Nda tomah.
HOSHI: He says the soil here isn't good for planting.
LARR: Gol dach puu kani valakii. Hrat atiba si ohno.
HOSHI: The Valakians don't let them live where the land is fertile.
LARR: Valakii fora tlet rasata kee, akem, pinj erana.
HOSHI: The Valakians give them whatever they need. Food, clothing,
medicine.
LARR: Menk akata y Valakii.
HOSHI: He says the Valakians are good to them. They protect them.
(All tuck into the food.)
PHLOX [OC]: Despite the Menk's insistence that they're treated well, my
human crewmates seem to see things differently.
CUTLER: Tik tik. Well, that's the last one.
PHLOX [OC]: They think the Menk are being exploited by the Valakians,
so their first instinct is to rise to their defence, despite the fact
that the Menk don't appear to need or want a defender.
PHLOX: Wait a moment. (Larr has been re-arranging the phials in the
container.) PHLOX: Impressive.
CUTLER: What'd he do?
PHLOX: He's grouped the samples together by family. Cross-referenced by
bloodlines and marriage if I'm interpreting the colour codes correctly.
Tik tik.
PHLOX [OC]: On the surface the Menk appear to be a primitive species,
unsophisticated even by human standards. No offence. But their
abilities appear to have been underestimated, even by myself.
CUTLER: It seems like a vacation, if I didn't keep remembering why we
were here.
HOSHI: I'm going to help Larr finish packing up. He's back on duty at
the hospital in an hour. (Hoshi leaves.)
CUTLER: This really doesn't bother you.
PHLOX: What?
CUTLER: The way the Valakians treat them.
PHLOX: Why should it? On most worlds with two humanoid species one
would have driven the other to extinction. Here, they've developed a
symbiotic relationship that seems to work quite well.
CUTLER: They force the Menk to live in compounds. They treat them
almost like pets.
PHLOX: Their culture is different. It's their way.
CUTLER: Doesn't make it right.
PHLOX: Are you married, crewman?
CUTLER: Of course not. I would have told you.
PHLOX: I'm married.
CUTLER: You are?
PHLOX: Three times.
CUTLER: So, you have two ex-wives?
PHLOX: I have three current wives and they each have two husbands not
counting myself.
CUTLER: Is that considered normal for Denobulans?
PHLOX: Quite.
CUTLER: Why are you telling me this?
PHLOX: I've been getting certain signals from you that suggest you may
be interested in a romantic relationship with me.
CUTLER: Oh.
PHLOX: Unless I misinterpreted those signals.
CUTLER: You didn't. But I still don't know why you're telling me this.
PHLOX: You need to know that my culture is different.
CUTLER: That doesn't matter.
PHLOX: It doesn't? This culture's different. That seems to matter to
you a great deal.
CUTLER: Phlox, as far as your extended family goes I'm not interested
in becoming wife number four. I just want to be your friend.
PHLOX: What do you mean by friend?
CUTLER: Let's just see where it goes.
 [Valakian hospital ward]
(The alien removes his oxygen mask.)  ALIEN: Captain, I'm
glad you could come.
ARCHER: It was no problem. How are you feeling?
ALIEN: The medication you gave us helps with the pain, but my prognosis
hasn't changed.
ARCHER: We're trying to do something about that. I have a lot of faith
in Doctor Phlox.
ALIEN: I wanted to thank you for getting me home before it was too
late. It took us a year to get out to where you found us. You brought
us home in a day.
ARCHER: We started out in ships very similar to yours. Someday you'll
be travelling just as fast as we are.
ALIEN: Someday may not be soon enough. If your doctor can't help us we
need to keep searching for others that can. We need warp drive. A
million more of us will die before our next ship even leaves this
system. With warp engines we won't have to wait for people to find us.
We can seek help on our own.
ARCHER: You may not find that everyone you meet wants to help you.
ALIEN: Still, we have to try. (comm. beep.)
ARCHER: Archer.
PHLOX [OC]: It's Phlox, Captain. We've collected all the samples.
ARCHER: I'll meet you at the shuttlepod. Archer out.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Anything to report?
T'POL: We've received twenty nine hails in the past two hours.
ARCHER: From whom?
T'POL: Apparently, word of our arrival has spread quickly. Other
clinics are requesting help. Two orbital spacecraft approached us while
you were on the planet. They mistakenly believed that we already had a
cure. We had to turn them away.
ARCHER: Do you have a minute?
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: The Valakians want our warp technology.
T'POL: What did you tell them?
ARCHER: That I'd think about it.
T'POL: And?
ARCHER: Safe to say I know where you stand on the subject.
T'POL: Even if you give them our reactor schematics they don't have the
technical expertise to build a warp engine.
ARCHER: They have no experience working with antimatter. I doubt they
even realize how dangerous it is. They're not ready.
T'POL: Then your decision shouldn't be difficult.
ARCHER: We could stay and help them.
T'POL: The Vulcans stayed to help Earth ninety years ago. We're still
there.
ARCHER: I never thought I'd say this, but I'm beginning to understand
how the Vulcans must have felt.(In Sickbay, Phlox is studying a DNA sequence, and
what he sees troubles him greatly.)
 [Mess hall]
 PHLOX: Trouble sleeping, Captain?
ARCHER: Looks like I'm not the only one.
PHLOX: Actually, Denobulans require very little rest, unless you count
our annual hibernation cycle.
ARCHER: Am I going to be without my doctor this winter?
PHLOX: Only for six days.
ARCHER: Maybe I'll join you. Any progress?
PHLOX: The research has been challenging, to say the least.
ARCHER: A cure, Doctor. Have you found a cure?
PHLOX: Even if I could find one, I'm not sure it would be ethical.
ARCHER: Ethical?
PHLOX: We'd be interfering with an evolutionary process that has been
going on for thousands of years.
ARCHER: Every time you treat an illness, you're interfering. That's
what doctors do.
PHLOX: You're forgetting about the Menk.
ARCHER: What about the Menk?
PHLOX: I've been studying their genome as well, and I've seen evidence
of increasing intelligence. Motor skills, linguistic abilities. Unlike
the Valakians they appear to be in the process of an evolutionary
awakening. It may take millennia, but the Menk have the potential to
become the dominant species on this planet.
ARCHER: And that won't happen as long as the Valakians are around.
PHLOX: If the Menk are to flourish, they need an opportunity to survive
on their own.
ARCHER: Well, what are you suggesting? We choose one species over the
other?
PHLOX: All I'm saying is that we let nature make the choice.
ARCHER: The hell with nature. You're a doctor. You have a moral
obligation to help people who are suffering.
PHLOX: I'm also a scientist, and I'm obligated to consider the larger
issues. Thirty five thousand years ago, your species co-existed with
other humanoids. Isn't that correct?
ARCHER: Go ahead.
PHLOX: What if an alien race had interfered and given the Neanderthals
an evolutionary advantage? Fortunately for you, they didn't.
ARCHER: I appreciate your perspective on all of this, but we're talking
about something that might happen. Might happen thousands of years from
now. They've asked for our help. I am not prepared to walk away based
on a theory.
PHLOX: Evolution is more than a theory. It is a fundamental scientific
principle. Forgive me for saying so, but I believe your compassion for
these people is affecting your judgment.
ARCHER: My compassion guides my judgment.
PHLOX: Captain.
ARCHER: Can you find a cure? Doctor?
PHLOX: I already have.
 PHLOX [OC]: Two days ago, when we first discovered
the alien shuttle, I had no idea that I'd be facing a dilemma of this
magnitude. For the first time, I find myself in conflict with my
Captain. But he is my Captain and he's placed a great deal of trust in
me. I believe I owe him the same. I only hope that he is willing to
look beyond his sympathy for these poor people.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: Doctor.
PHLOX: Captain.
ARCHER: I'm going down to the Valakian hospital.
PHLOX: Sir, it would go against all my principles if I didn't ask you
to reconsider what I
ARCHER: I have reconsidered. I spent the whole night reconsidering, and
what I've decided goes against all my principles. Someday my people are
going to come up with some sort of a doctrine, something that tells us
what we can and can't do out here, should and shouldn't do. But until
somebody tells me that they've drafted that directive I'm going to have
to remind myself every day that we didn't come out here to play God.
 PHLOX [OC]: I'd like to think, Doctor Lucas, that
if I'd had the chance to talk to you face to face you'd have never let
me even consider withholding my findings from the Captain. But I'm
ashamed to say that I almost did just that.
 [Valakian hospital ward]
 ARCHER: Phlox tells me this medicine will help
ease the symptoms for a decade, maybe more. A lot can happen in that
time. I wouldn't be surprised if you developed a cure on your own.
ESAAK: And if we don't? With a warp capable starship, our chances would
be greatly improved.
ARCHER: I'm sorry. (Archer hands over a PADD.) ARCHER: This will give you detailed
instructions on how to synthesise more of the medicine.
ESAAK: We appreciate everything you've done.
 PHLOX [OC]: If I hadn't trusted him to make the
right choice I'd have been no better than the Vulcan diplomats who held
your species back because they felt you couldn't make proper decisions
on your own.
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox is dictating his letter.) PHLOX:  I came very close to
misjudging Jonathan Archer, but this incident has helped me gain a new
respect for him. Happiness and health to you, Doctor. Your dedicated
colleague, Phlox. (Hoshi enters.)HOSHI: You wanted to see me?
PHLOX: Please. (He hands over the data slide.) PHLOX: For Doctor Lucas.
HOSHI: It'll go out first thing in the morning. Everything all right?
PHLOX: Fine, fine. The past few days have been taxing.
HOSHI: Want my advice? Get out of Sickbay.
PHLOX: Yes. Perhaps you're right.
HOSHI: Good night. (Hoshi leaves.)
PHLOX: Good night. Phlox to Crewman Cutler.
CUTLER [OC]: Go ahead.
PHLOX: I, er, know it's short notice, but I was wondering if you might
like to join me for a little snack in the Mess hall. I could use a
friend right about now.
CUTLER [OC]: Ten minutes?
PHLOX: Thank you. Sweet dreams. (He turns off the lights and leaves.)

  [Armoury]
 (A phase pistol is loaded, and a target projector is
set up.)
REED: You have a ten second firing window. Ready?
HOSHI: Ready.
REED: Go. (He pushes a button on PADD, the 3D target starts moving around
and Hoshi fires a lot of shots in its direction.) REED: Time.
HOSHI: Any better?
REED: Your hit to miss ratio is still below fifty percent. If those had
been live rounds, you'd have blown out two or three bulkheads.
HOSHI: I never had this much trouble with the EM-33.
REED: This is an entirely new weapon. Unlike the EM-33 you don't have
to compensate for particle drift. Just point straight at the target,
and try and keep your shoulders relaxed. It's hard to aim accurately
when you're tense. Ahem.
HOSHI: You all right?
REED: Yeah, fine. You'll get the hang of it. Let's try for twenty
seconds this time.
(The engine sound changes.)
HOSHI: I thought we were staying at warp for the next few days. (Reed checks the monitor.)
REED: We're approaching a gas giant. Class nine.
HOSHI: So much for target practice.
REED: We'll pick it up tomorrow.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: The probe's entered the outer atmosphere. (The viewscreen is fuzzy orange.)
ARCHER: Can we clean up the signal?
HOSHI: I'm trying, sir. There's a lot of EM interference. It sounds
very strange.
T'POL: Intense magnetic fields often create unique waveforms.
ARCHER: Let's hear them. (Electronic Jupiter-type music,)
TRAVIS: Siren calls. That's what we called them when I was a kid. My
dad would put them through the speakers whenever we flew by a gas
giant. It gave me nightmares sometimes. (Hoshi stops the sounds.)
T'POL: Other than keeping Ensign Mayweather up at night, I'm not sure
what we expect to accomplish here. There are four gas giants in your
own solar system.
ARCHER: None of them are class nine. I think this one's worth a closer
look.
T'POL: I'm reading an anomalous power signature in the lower
atmosphere, and several biosigns.
ARCHER: Get the probe closer.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir. (Through the murk, a ship comes into view.)
 [Sickbay]
(Reed sneezing into a tissue.)  REED: We can travel
faster than the speed of light. You'd think we could find a cure for
the common cold.
PHLOX: You should be grateful. A human cold is so mild. I once had a
patient with the Kamaraazite flu. He sneezed so violently he nearly
regurgitated his pineal gland.
REED: I don't see how I could actually catch a cold on a hermetically
sealed starship.
PHLOX: Oh, you may have picked up the virus from a piece of equipment.
It could have been lurking inside a sealed container.
REED: I did open a case of plasma coolant.
PHLOX: Whoever packed that case was probably nursing a cold.
REED: But that was back in Spacedock five months ago.
PHLOX: You underestimate the tenacity of a virus, Lieutenant. It can
lay dormant for months, adapt to whatever environment it finds itself
in. This should ease the symptoms. (Phlox gives Reed a hypospray.) PHLOX: But the only cure
I know of involves bed rest.
REED: No, that'll have to wait. The Captain wants me on the team
investigating that shipwreck.
PHLOX: Well, you won't be contagious inside an environment suit. Just
try not to sneeze in your helmet.
REED: I'll do my best.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in. Hoshi.
HOSHI: Do you have a minute, sir?
ARCHER: Of course. What's on your mind?
HOSHI: That shipwreck. We have no idea what type of life forms we'll
find on that alien vessel, and there's a lot of interference in the
atmosphere. Are you sure the away team won't need a translator?
ARCHER: They have their UTs, and we'll try to keep an open comlink.
HOSHI: What about the language on the control panels, the hatches? They
might need someone to help them find their way around.
ARCHER: Are you trying to tell me something?
HOSHI: I realise that I haven't always been the first one in line to
volunteer for this type of mission, but I want you to know that I am
prepared to go. Took a while, but I think I finally got my space legs.
ARCHER: I never doubted that you'd find them. Your timing couldn't be
better. T'Pol just asked me to assign you to the team. You'd better get
to the launch bay before they leave without you.
HOSHI: Aye, sir.
 [Locker room]
 T'POL: I thought you were acquainted with the
environmental suit.
HOSHI: I am. I'm just brushing up on the backup systems. I wouldn't
want the emergency oxygen to fail during a hull breach.
REED: Trust me, Ensign. If there's a hull breach the pressure will
crush you to something about this big. (He holds up a clenched fist.)
T'POL: I requested you for your skills as a translator, but if you're
uncomfortable.
HOSHI: I'm perfectly comfortable. I used to find the suits a little
claustrophobic, but I'm getting used to them. I'll see you in the
shuttlepod.
 [Shuttlepod]
(Reed is doing the flying.)  REED: It's one hundred
kilometres below us, still descending.
T'POL: Gravity's pulling it deeper into the atmosphere. At their
current altitude the pressure is fifteen thousand gsc.
REED: That's well within our hull tolerance.
T'POL: For the moment. But at the rate that vessel is sinking, we'll
have an hour at most.
HOSHI: You sound uncomfortable, Sub-Commander.
T'POL: I'm merely stating facts.
REED: We'll be on our way back well before we're in any danger. I for
one have no interest in imploding a valuable shuttlepod.
HOSHI: Or three valuable officers. (The pod shakes.)
T'POL: We've entered an eddy of liquid helium. We're clear.
HOSHI: That wasn't so bad.
T'POL: One hundred metres.
HOSHI: Is that a hatch on the port side?
REED: I see it.
T'POL: Fifty metres. Forty.
HOSHI: What's that?
REED: It's just the proximity alarm.
T'POL: Twenty metres. Ten. Engaging docking interface.
 [Alien ship]
 T'POL: Nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Carbon dioxide
levels are high, but nothing's toxic. It's breathable.
HOSHI: You first. (Reed opens his helmet and nods, T'Pol opens hers and
nearly gags.) HOSHI: Perhaps we should leave the helmets on.
REED: What is it?
HOSHI: (coughing) You can't smell that?
REED: No. This damn cold.
HOSHI: Count your blessings. (They walk along the corridor.) HOSHI: You two might
want to take a look at this. (There are symbols on a bulkhead.) HOSHI: It says deck two,
red sector.
REED: What language?
HOSHI: Klingon. (All draw their phase pistols.) HOSHI: I thought you knew
Klingon ships. Why didn't you recognise this one from the outside?
T'POL: There are many classes of ships. I'm not familiar with all of
them.
REED: So I'm assuming you don't know how many Klingons are on board.
T'POL: I'm reading three biosigns. That way. All very weak.
HOSHI: How weak?
 [Klingon bridge]
 T'POL: They're still alive. We should leave before
they regain consciousness.
REED: And what if they don't? The atmosphere's going to crush this ship
like an eggshell pretty soon.
HOSHI: Shouldn't we try to help them?
T'POL: They don't want our help.
HOSHI: How do you know?
T'POL: They're Klingons. To die at their post assures them a path to
the afterlife. If we rescue them, they'd be dishonoured.
REED: Well, I for one don't intend to just fly off and let these people
die, honourable deaths or not.
T'POL: Your compassion is admirable but misguided. If they awake and
find us on their ship, they'll kill us. (In the Klingon galley, there are carcasses hanging from butcher's hooks, some
green stuff in bowls. A woman walks out of a storage area,)
 [Klingon bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: How many are there?
T'POL: Three on the bridge, but I'm detecting at least nine more
biosigns on board.
ARCHER [OC]: You can't tell what happened to them?
 [Bridge]
 T'POL [OC]: I'm detecting residual amounts of an
carbon dioxide based neurotoxin, but it seems to have dissipated.
There's not enough to affect us.
ARCHER: Stand by. How long is the pod's hull going to hold up?
TUCKER: At their present rate of descent, half hour, give or take.
ARCHER: T'Pol.
T'POL [OC]: Yes, Captain.
ARCHER: You've got twenty minutes to see if you can do anything for
that crew, then I want you out of there.
 [Klingon bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: Understood?
T'POL: I don't believe there's anything we can do in twenty minutes. I
suggest we leave now.
ARCHER [OC]: You have a margin of safety. (He crackles out.)
T'POL: Captain? T'Pol to Enterprise.
 [Klingon corridor]
 (The Klingon woman moves towards the voices.)
REED [OC]: Damn interference.
T'POL [OC]: Or we've dropped out of comm. range.
HOSHI [OC]: We still have twenty minutes.
T'POL [OC]: It doesn't make sense to place ourselves at risk when
they'd rather die.
REED [OC]: There must be something we can do. Maybe they have a
distress beacon we can activate.
 [Klingon bridge]
 (The woman sees them then retreats.)
T'POL: I doubt you'll find one. Klingons don't call for help.
HOSHI: What if we carry some of them into the pod? We could save three
or four.
T'POL: And if they wake up on the trip back to Enterprise? (The sound of a
bulkhead closing. Reed pulls his pistol and goes to investigate. The woman
jumps him and escapes.)
 [Klingon Corridor]
 HOSHI: What's that?
T'POL: It's our shuttlepod taking off.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER: Try it now.
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol. What's your status?
TUCKER: They're back in comm. range. (Travis sees the shuttlepod leaving the gas giant.)
TRAVIS:  Captain.
ARCHER: Shuttlepod One, respond.
TRAVIS: Sir, they're heading into open space.
TUCKER: I'm picking up something.
BU'KAH [OC]: Duj-to! Chak wa kah Deesh paklah! kah Deesh paklah!
ARCHER: Sounds like Klingon.
TUCKER: I'll try to tie in the UT.
BU'KAH [OC]: Chak wa kah Deesh paklah! kah Deesh paklah! 'kiv Duj in
range. Respond. We've been attacked by an unknown ship designation
Enterprise NX-01. Any warships in range, respond.
ARCHER: Set a pursuit course.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: Bring the grappler online.
(The launcher lowers, two lines are fired and latch onto the
shuttlepod.)
TUCKER: We've got it.
ARCHER: Bridge to Security. Send a team to launch bay one. Trip. The
bridge is yours, Travis.
TRAVIS: Yes, sir.
 [Launch bay]
 (Archer and Trip enter cautiously, with phase
pistols drawn, two security guards right behind them. The pod hatch is
open, and Bu'kaH jumps the guard who goes to look inside. It takes stun
shots from both Archer and Trip to knock her out.)
ARCHER: Everybody all right? (Trip nods as the guards get up again.)
ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge.
TRAVIS [OC]: Mayweather.
ARCHER: Have you still got a fix on the shipwreck?
TRAVIS [OC]: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: Transfer the coordinates to the launch bay. I'm going back for
the boarding party.
TRAVIS [OC]: Sir, the alien ship sunk another two thousand metres. It's
below the shuttle's safety limits.
ARCHER: Then polarise the hull plating. We'll take Enterprise down.
 [Klingon Bridge]
 REED: There's got to be some way off this ship.
HOSHI: What about escape pods?
REED: I don't know about the structural integrity of Klingon escape
pods. My guess is we're better off in here.
T'POL: It's irrelevant, Lieutenant. Klingons don't use escape pods. It
would be considered an act of cowardice to abandon ship.
HOSHI: Maybe we can use their comm. system to contact Enterprise.
T'POL: I doubt their comm. will penetrate the EM field any better than
our own. If we can access their helm controls we might be able to put
this vessel into a stable orbit.
REED: I haven't had much experience at piloting Klingon ships.
T'POL: We have no other choice. (The hull groans under the pressure.)
T'POL: Start translating those consoles. Look for anything marked propulsion,
helm, navigation.
HOSHI: I'll try, but reading Klingon is a lot different than speaking
it.
REED: We could always try waking one of them to help us.
HOSHI: All right. (reads a monitor screen) Kolat chack tabak. Plasma
containment, maybe.
T'POL: You're certain?
HOSHI: Containment. I'm certain. (She moves to the next screen.) HOSHI: Pu'DaH dak cha.
Something they call photon torpedoes.
REED: Photon torpedoes? I've never heard of anything like that. What
else?
HOSHI: Well, this all looks like weapons systems. Torpedoes, tactical
sensors, disruptor arrays.
T'POL: (another screen) What about this one?
HOSHI: I recognise pressure. Ka'tahl. That can mean wall or barrier.
T'POL: Or hull?
HOSHI: Maybe.
REED: If I'm reading this correctly we've got a few hours at most. The
hull integrity's failing.
T'POL: Then we'd better hurry. This appears to be the helm station.
HOSHI: I think you're right. Quee nagah. Impulse drive.
REED: Good work, Hoshi. (Reed tries to use the controls, but alarms sound
instead and text scrolls on a screen.) REED: Hoshi?
HOSHI: It says the pressure's failing in the J'khat bah. Fusion
manifold. Do you know what that means?
REED: To quote our very own Mister Tucker, that means we're dead in the
water.
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to boarding party. Come in.
HOSHI: We read you, Captain.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: How are you holding up?
HOSHI [OC]: We're doing okay, sir. It's nice to hear your voice.
ARCHER: What's your status?
 [Klingon Bridge]
 T'POL: We've been attempting to restart their
engines, but they appear to be offline.
ARCHER [OC]: Don't worry about it. We're coming to get you.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Travis, how much farther?
TRAVIS: Ten thousand metres, but I'm having a hard time getting a fix
on them. Too much interference.
ARCHER: Is our probe still working?
TUCKER: Barely.
ARCHER: Try using it to triangulate their position.
(But we see the probe implode.)
TUCKER: The probe's gone. (The hull groans.)
TRAVIS: Sir, external pressure's at maximum.
ARCHER: I'm afraid we've got a little hitch in our rescue plan. (Big
metallic groans.)
TRAVIS: The hull plating's failing.
ARCHER: We'll be back for you as soon as we can.
 [Klingon Bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: In the meantime, just sit tight.
(He dissolves into static.)
HOSHI: Captain, you're breaking up. Captain?
 [Sickbay]
(The Klingon woman is struggling against biobed restraints.)
 BU'KAH: Release me. Cowards! Let me die on my feet.
PHLOX: T'Pol was right. There's a neurotoxin in her bloodstream.
Untreated, it could kill her within a day or two.
ARCHER: Can you do anything?
PHLOX: I'm working on it.
TUCKER: T'Pol said the Klingons were unconscious. Why is this one so
lively?
PHLOX: She's showing the effects of hypothermia. My guess is she took
refuge in a low temperature environment aboard her ship. The cold would
have delayed the effects of the toxin.
BU'KAH: I demand to speak to your Captain.
TUCKER: You know, I read if they sense a leader's weak, they'll try to
kill him and take command.
ARCHER: I'm the Captain.
BU'KAH: I've never seen your kind before but you have made an enemy of
the Klingon Empire.
ARCHER: From what I've noticed, that's not hard to do. You stranded
three of my people down there.
BU'KAH: You raided my vessel, infected my crew.
ARCHER: We didn't infect anyone. We boarded your ship to try and help.
BU'KAH: Liar.
ARCHER: Look, I don't know what happened to your crew but we had
nothing to do with it. Now your vessel is sinking deeper into the
atmosphere and unless we do something, it'll be destroyed.
BU'KAH: Better that than let it fall into your hands.
ARCHER: I've got three very capable people on your ship. Let them help.
If you tell them how to get the engines running, they can fly it out of
there.
BU'KAH: And fly it where? Back to your world to steal our secrets?
ARCHER: No.
BU'KAH: When our Birds of Prey arrive, your ship will be destroyed.
ARCHER: (to Trip, leaving) Remind me to stop trying to help people.
 [Situation room]
 TRAVIS: I found these schematics in the Vulcan
database. It's a Raptor Class scout vessel.
ARCHER: How long will it last down there?
TRAVIS: Its hull's at least twice as thick as ours, reinforced with
some kind of coherent molecular alloy.
TUCKER: Yeah, it's a tough little ship but it can't hold up under that
pressure forever. What if we use duratanium braces to reinforce a
shuttlepod? It won't look pretty but, it might hold up long enough for
us to get our people out.
TRAVIS: Our only other option is for T'Pol and Malcolm to fix a
broken-down Klingon ship and fly it out themselves.
ARCHER: I don't think we're going to get any help from our guest in
Sickbay. Get started on those braces. (Trip leaves.) ARCHER: Keep an eye out for
any Klingon ships coming this way.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
 [Klingon Bridge]
 (The three have removed their outer suits and are
down to blue long-johns.)
REED: The one time we need our Chief Engineer is the one time we leave
him behind.
HOSHI: Come look at this. (She gets a recording playing on a screen in
front of the captain's chair.)
KLINGON [on monitor]: OonoS Thrott! Nej joS mIch ka Xanant 'ach pagh
Q'tahL Class planet. We destroyed their ship, but we've sustained
damage in our port fusion injector. We've descended into the outer
atmosphere of a Q'tahL Class planet to make repairs in case there are
other Xarantine ships in the area. My crew is falling ill and I have
been unable to determine why. If we had died when the Xarantine
attacked our honour would be secure, but to fall victim to some
disease, to be crushed into nothing in the depths of this miserable
planet.
REED: Sounds like we need to find the port fusion injector.
HOSHI: Wait, I saw that somewhere. Here. One deck below us. It's in the
reactor pit.
REED: Reactor pit? Could that be Engineering?
HOSHI: Could be.
 [Klingon Engineering]
 REED: This one?
HOSHI: No. That says something about plasma induction. Here it is. Port
fusion injector. (The panel has a Klingon slumped across it, so Reed
and T'Pol haul him away.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 (Archer is doing some welding.) ARCHER: I think I might have
made a tactical error dealing with the Klingon woman. I asked her for
help. She could see that as a sign of weakness.
TUCKER: You been boning up on your Klingon psychology?
ARCHER: We've run into them three times, and every time they've wanted
to destroy us. I'd love to figure out why. TUCKER: Well, maybe the best
thing is just to steer clear of them.
ARCHER: That may not be so easy. We could use their help right now. If
we can re-establish a comm. signal with T'Pol and the others, the
Klingon woman could probably talk them through the repairs, but she's
got a thousand generations of instinct telling her not to trust me.
TUCKER: Maybe it's time you started thinking like a Klingon.
[deleted scene]
PHLOX [OC]: Sickbay to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: You'll be pleased to know I've
developed an antitoxin. There's an interesting wrinkle, though. When
you have a moment I'd like to share it with you.
 [Klingon Engineering]
 (Reed stand up, staggers and burns his hand
against a pipe.)
REED: Argh!
HOSHI: Are you okay?
REED: Yes. I seem to be getting a little light-headed. Must be the
heat.
T'POL: You're dehydrated. You need some water.
HOSHI: I saw a galley on the schematics. Deck four, blue sector. I'll
see what I can find.
T'POL: You shouldn't go alone.
REED: Watch yourselves.
 [Klingon Galley]
(Hoshi picks up a bowl to see what's in
it.)  T'POL: It's called gagh. It's a Klingon delicacy, but only when they're
alive.
HOSHI: They look like worms.
T'POL: They are worms. (Hoshi stirs the ladle in a pot and pulls up an animal skull.) HOSHI: Ugh!
(They hear movement from behind a door, and ready their phase pistols.
T'Pol opens the door to reveal three pigs with lots of spines and
attitude, then shuts it again)
T'POL: Targs. Klingons prefer their food freshly slaughtered. Are you
all right? (Hoshi sits down, scared and upset.)
HOSHI: I promised myself I wouldn't do
this.
T'POL: You're in a dangerous situation in an alien environment. Your
anxiety is understandable.
HOSHI: Don't you mean, for a human?
T'POL: You can't deny your nature.
HOSHI: This may sound strange but I envy you sometimes. I know, another
pesky human emotion, but there are times I wish I could just ignore my
feelings. Bury them the way Vulcans do.
T'POL: Take my hand.
HOSHI: Excuse me? (T'Pol kneels in front of her.)
T'POL:  My hand. Close your eyes. (She puts three
fingers on Hoshi's palm.) T'POL: Think of yourself on a turbulent ocean. You
have the power to control the waves.
HOSHI: Whatever it is you're trying to do, it's not working. (T'Pol shifts her fingers.)
T'POL: Focus. The waves are subsiding. The water
is growing still. You're in control.
HOSHI: That was amazing.
T'POL: When we return to the ship, I'll teach you how to do it on your
own.
HOSHI: Thanks. (The ship jolts.)
T'POL: Lieutenant Reed, report.
 [Klingon Engineering]
 REED: The hull pressure's approaching critical.
This ship's about to be crushed.
(A visual of the outer hull starting to cave in. Reed is drinking.)
REED: It'll work.
T'POL: If you're wrong, you could destroy the ship.
REED: Look, even with Hoshi's help it could take hours just to find the
fusion injector in here. We're out of time.
HOSHI: I say we try the weapons.
T'POL: How do you know you can even access the tactical systems?
REED: If there's one thing on board this ship I ought to be able to
figure out, it's the torpedoes.
 [Ready room]
 TUCKER: I'd like to run one more structural
diagnostic before you launch.
ARCHER: Qapla'.
TUCKER: Beg your pardon?
ARCHER: Success. I decided to take your advice about thinking like a
Klingon. The Vulcan database has about nine hundred pages on them.
TUCKER: Learn anything?
ARCHER: Plenty. They're driven by a warrior mentality. They tend to
view anyone they meet as a potential enemy.
TUCKER: That may explain why our guest is so irritable.
ARCHER: They also have a strong sense of duty. Er, Heh CHo' mruak tah.
Death before dishonour. Finish up that diagnostic. I'll be in Sickbay.
TUCKER: Going to go put your homework to use?
ARCHER: Something like that.
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox gives Bu'kaH a hypo.)  PHLOX: Please relax. If you
strain against the straps you might hurt yourself.
BU'KAH: What's that? Is that what you used against my crew?
ARCHER: Doctor Phlox has developed an antidote to the neurotoxin in
your system.
BU'KAH: Is this how you plan to gain my trust? First poison me, then
miraculously cure me?
ARCHER: Have you had a drink lately?
BU'KAH: What?
ARCHER: The bio-agent that affected you and your crew was consumed,
apparently in alcohol.
PHLOX: Specifically, the toxin was bonded to a molecule unique to
Xarantine ale.
BU'KAH: There was a raid.
ARCHER: Yes? I can understand your not wanting to talk about it, if the
raid went badly for you.
BU'KAH: The Xarantines are no match for us! We attacked their outpost
and took what we wanted.
PHLOX: And that included some Xarantine ale? (She nods)
ARCHER: Did your whole crew drink it?
BU'KAH: The triumph belonged to all.
ARCHER: I'll take that as a yes. It was that ale that infected you, not
us. Think about it. When did your crew start getting sick? Was it right
after the raid? After you celebrated your victory?
BU'KAH: This is a trick.
ARCHER: Is it? How do you feel? Better or worse since the injection? We
can make enough of this for your entire crew, if it's not too late.
What if this isn't a trick? What if we're telling you the truth? You'd
be letting your crew die a very dishonourable death when you could have
saved them. Can you live with that?
 [Klingon Bridge]
 (A photon torpedo has been fired down into the
lower atmosphere.)
HOSHI: One thousand metres. Two thousand. Three thousand. (Detonation,
the ship shakes.) HOSHI: No effect! We're still sinking.
T'POL: The shock wave dissipated before it reached us.
REED: We'll need to detonate one closer next time. (The hull groans)
T'POL: The ship's hull is under enough pressure already. If you
detonate a torpedo too close.
REED: And if I don't? We need to generate a large enough shock wave to
push us into a higher orbit. To do that, the blast has to be big and it
has to be close. (T'Pol nods.) REED: You heard the Sub-Commander. Load two
this time.
 [Shuttlepod]
(Archer is doing the flying.)  ARCHER: Sensor resolution's
dropping off.
BU'KAH: This was your plan? To grope in the darkness and hope to
stumble across my ship?
ARCHER: That's how we found it the first time. (The shuttlepod jolts.)
BU'KAH: What was that?
ARCHER: Weapons fire.
BU'KAH: Where?
ARCHER: Bearing two nine seven mark two six one, down about two
kilometres.
 [Klingon Bridge]
 REED: Did it work?
HOSHI: We've moved up, but only two hundred metres.
REED: That's all? (There is a big bang inside the ship.)
HOSHI: A compartment just collapsed. Deck
three, green sector.
REED: This whole damn ship's coming apart. How many torpedoes do we
have left?
HOSHI: Six.
REED: Load two more.
HOSHI: It won't be enough.
REED: Load the weapons.
HOSHI: We already tried. It didn't work.
REED: Ensign.
T'POL: She's right. We'll never reach a safe altitude climbing a few
hundred metres at a time.
REED: The longer we stand around arguing the more ground we lose.
HOSHI: Fire them all. What if we detonated all the torpedoes at once?
T'POL: We may gain enough altitude, but I doubt we'd make it in one
piece.
HOSHI: I don't know about you but I'm willing to take the chance.
REED: We'll detonate at eight hundred metres.
HOSHI: I was thinking more like five hundred. Look, I didn't come all
this way to get crushed in the atmosphere of some anonymous gas giant.
Loading ports one through six.
REED: Brace yourselves.
HOSHI: Torpedoes armed. (as she presses the launch button, circuits
explode on the bridge)
 [Shuttlepod]
 BU'KAH: What is it?
ARCHER: Another explosion. There's a shock wave this time. Hang on.
(Debris flies up past the shuttlepod, then the ship itself comes into
view.)
 [Klingon Bridge]
(T'Pol answers her communicator.)  T'POL: T'Pol.
ARCHER [OC]: What have you been shooting at?
REED: We used the shock waves to gain some altitude but it's only
temporary. We'll start sinking again unless we can come up with a way
to get this ship out of here.
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER: I brought someone who should be able to
help do just that. We're docking now.
 [Klingon corridor]
 ARCHER: I believe you've all met Officer Bu'kaH.
What's the status of their engines?
T'POL: The Klingon crew made most of the necessary repairs before they
were overcome, but the port fusion injector is still damaged.
BU'KAH: I will tend to my own ship.
ARCHER: I didn't bring you down here just so you could die with your
shipmates. My crew risked their lives to get this ship out of danger. I
don't intend to leave until the job is finished.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Sir, there are two ships approaching at
high warp. I think they're Klingon.
TUCKER: How long till they get here?
TRAVIS: Sixteen minutes. We're being hailed. It's the Captain.
TUCKER: On screen.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: This is Klingon Raptor Somraw, hailing
Enterprise. Request permission to disembark four passengers. (Bu'kaH is
in the Captain's chair.)
TUCKER: Well, I don't see why not.
(A little later) TUCKER: I kept your seat warm for you.
ARCHER: Thanks. Get ready to break orbit, Travis. I think we've had
about enough of this place.
TRAVIS: Aye, Captain. It's the Raptor, sir. They're hailing us.
TUCKER: Calling to say thanks?
ARCHER: I doubt it. Put it through. (The Klingon Captain appears on the
viewscreen.) What can I do for you?
KLINGON [on viewscreen]: Prepare to surrender your vessel.
ARCHER: Maybe your engineer neglected to tell you, but we just saved
you and your crew.
KLINGON [on viewscreen]: You violated our ship, accessed our weapons.
ARCHER: It was either that or stand by and watch you get crushed.
KLINGON [on viewscreen]: Disruptors!
TUCKER: They're charging weapons.
ARCHER: You wouldn't last ten seconds in a battle with us. You've got
multiple hull breaches, your shields are down, and from what I'm told
you're fresh out of torpedoes. If I were you, I'd take what little
honour I had left and go home. Fire one shot and I'll blast you right
back to where we found you. (The transmission ends with a snarl.)
TRAVIS: They're moving off.
ARCHER: Get us out of here before their friends show up. (He shakes head.)
 [Decon chamber]
 (The team is relaxing in the UV light, and the comm. unit is beeping.)
REED: Is someone going to get that?
HOSHI: You're closer.
T'POL: T'Pol.
PHLOX [OC]: This is Doctor Phlox. You'll be happy to know that you're
now free of any microbes or parasites. Your captivity in Decon is over.
REED: Are you sure, Doctor? Who knows what was living on that ship?
HOSHI: What if we picked up something your scans can't detect?
PHLOX [OC]: Well, I'm quite sure you didn't. I've run every possible
test.
T'POL: Maybe you should run them again, Doctor. I believe I'm
developing a slight headache.
PHLOX [OC]: Of course, if you insist. I wouldn't want to miss anything.
T'POL: Thank you, Doctor.
REED: That should buy us at least another half an hour.
HOSHI: Oh, I could stay in here all day.
REED: Went to a spa once in Mexico. The most relaxing place I've ever
been, but it doesn't compare to this. Oh, it certainly feels nice to be
clean again.
T'POL: It is pleasant.
HOSHI: Do you smell that?
T'POL: I don't smell anything.
HOSHI: Exactly.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Shadows of P'Jem
Shadows
of P'Jem
 Original Airdate: 6 Feb, 2002
  [Starfleet
headquarters, San Francisco - Forrest's office]
 SOVAL: The loss to the Vulcan people is
incalculable. P'Jem was one of our most revered sanctuaries.
FORREST: Ambassador, we are very sorry for your loss, but with all due
respect the High Command has to take some responsibility. You were
using the monastery as a surveillance station.
SOVAL: We were observing a dangerous and aggressive neighbour. The
Andorians wouldn't have found the station if your people hadn't
interfered. They've been in space for six months and they've already
destabilised an entire sector.
FORREST: I'm afraid I can't agree with that, Ambassador. This was a
volatile situation long before Starfleet got involved. Perhaps if you'd
been a little more open with us, this tragedy might have been avoided.
SOVAL: We warned you something like this would happen. He's too
impulsive. Captain Gardner would have made a far more suitable
commanding officer.
FORREST: The Vulcan Consulate doesn't make command assignments here.
SOVAL: There was a time when your people sought our guidance. I regret
that time has passed. I've been recalled to Vulcan for consultation. In
the meantime, our joint fleet operations have been suspended.
AIDE [OC]: Yes, Admiral?
FORREST: Get me Captain Archer.
AIDE [OC]: Aye sir.
 [Captain's mess]
 TUCKER: I noticed we changed course overnight.
ARCHER: I found a new system in the Vulcan database. Coridan. They're
only a few light years away so I thought we'd take a look.
TUCKER: Inhabited?
ARCHER: Just over three billion humanoids. Apparently, the Vulcans have
a mining agreement with them. I had Hoshi send a message to their
Chancellor and she invited us to visit their capital city.
TUCKER: Then I'll start shining my boots.
ARCHER: I think I'll just take Hoshi, this time. The Chancellor asked
me to limit the number of people I bring down until they get to know us
better.
TUCKER: Oh.
ARCHER: It's really too bad. According to the database, they've got the
largest starship construction yards in the sector. They're supposed to
have ships that can run circles around the Vulcans.
TUCKER: Better than six five?
ARCHER: They say some Coridan ships have reached warp seven, but that's
just a rumour.
TUCKER: Warp seven?
ARCHER: You should lend Hoshi your camera. I'll be sure she takes lots
of pictures.
(Archer finally cracks and grins.)
TUCKER: You had me going there for a minute.
ARCHER: You're just too easy a target.
TUCKER: So you're taking me, right?
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
HOSHI [OC]: I'm receiving a transmission from Starfleet Command. It's
Admiral Forrest, sir.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Was anyone killed?
FORREST [on monitor]: The Andorians gave the monks three hours before
they started their bombardment. Fortunately, they all got out in time.
ARCHER: How are the Vulcans taking this?
FORREST [on monitor]: Not well.
ARCHER: I can't really blame the Andorians for reacting this way.
FORREST [on monitor]: Jon.
ARCHER: If the roles were reversed the Vulcans might have done the same
thing.
FORREST [on monitor]: The Vulcans may have good reason for keeping an
eye on them. I've seen the reports. These Andorian commandos are a
dangerous group.
ARCHER: That's the same crap the Vulcans used to say about us.
FORREST [on monitor]: Jon, you're doing a lot of good work, but you've
got to be more careful. Earth can't be getting involved in
inter-species conflicts.
ARCHER: I understand.
FORREST [on monitor]: I'm afraid I've got some more bad news.
(Later, Archer is staring out of the window when the door bell sounds.)
ARCHER: Come in. Have a seat.
(T'Pol sits.)
ARCHER: I just spoke with Admiral
Forrest. There's no easy way to say this. The Andorians destroyed the
sanctuary at P'Jem.
T'POL: Were there any survivors?
ARCHER: Fortunately, the monks and the intelligence operatives were
given advance warning. They're fine.
T'POL: Was there time to remove any of the relics?
ARCHER: I don't know. The High Command believes we're to blame for
this. They're sending a ship to take you back to Vulcan. It'll be here
in two days.
T'POL: I won't have time to complete my scans of this sector. I'll ask
Ensign Mayweather to finish them.
ARCHER: Maybe I wasn't clear. This isn't a temporary transfer. They're
reassigning you.
T'POL: I understand the situation, Captain. I'm certain the High
Command will find you a suitable replacement.
ARCHER: Am I the only one who has a problem with this? Because you seem
perfectly fine.
T'POL: My assignment to the Enterprise was only supposed to last eight
days. It was unrealistic to expect it to continue indefinitely.
ARCHER: The High Command is looking for a scapegoat, someone to blame.
They can't punish me so they're taking it out on my science officer.
Sounds like an emotional reaction, if you ask me.
T'POL: I am largely responsible for what happened.
ARCHER: Don't give yourself too much credit. I was the one who found
P'Jem in the database, and I led the landing party. I want you to know
I'm filing a protest with the High Command.
T'POL: That won't make any difference.
ARCHER: You don't know that.
T'POL: Captain, I was assigned to Enterprise not simply as an observer,
but to represent the interests of the Vulcan people. It's clear in the
eyes of my superiors I haven't done that.
ARCHER: They have no right to do this to you. You're a part of my crew.
T'POL: For another forty eight hours. Was there anything else?
ARCHER: No.
 [Corridor]
 TUCKER: This is just another part of the joke,
right?
ARCHER: Sorry, Trip, but I've got to take T'Pol on this one. I need to
spend some time with her alone.
TUCKER:: Now I know you're pulling my leg.
ARCHER: T'Pol's being transferred. A Vulcan ship's on its way to take
her back.
TUCKER: What?
ARCHER: Meet me for lunch. I'll fill you in.
 [Mess hall]
 PHLOX: May I? I just heard about your transfer.
I'm sorry you'll be leaving us. I'm sure you'll excel at whatever new
assignment you're given.
T'POL: I haven't received another assignment.
PHLOX: I assumed you were being promoted.
T'POL: My superiors believe that I'm responsible for the destruction of
the P'Jem sanctuary.
PHLOX: Do you agree with their assessment?
T'POL: It's the logical conclusion.
PHLOX: I'm certain the High Command would reconsider your transfer if
they knew everything you've done for this crew. You realise you're not
the first Vulcan officer to be posted aboard a human starship. The High
Command has tried this before but none of the others lasted more than a
few weeks. They found their crewmates too chaotic and unpredictable.
But you've been here more than six months and you haven't merely
tolerated this crew, you've become part of it. Isn't it logical to take
pride in that accomplishment?
T'POL: Pride is a human indulgence.
PHLOX: I suppose it is. Oh, I have it on good authority that several
crewmembers are planning a gathering in your honour. I believe it's
called a going-away party. I'd keep on alert if I were you.
 [Shuttlepod]
 (En route to the Coridan capital city.)
ARCHER: So, what do you know about Coridan?
T'POL: There are three billion inhabitants, mostly concentrated in
several cities in the equatorial region.
ARCHER: I wasn't asking for the statistics. Your people have been
coming here for decades. You must know something about their culture,
the kinds of food they eat, what they do for fun.
T'POL: The Vulcan database doesn't contain that information.
ARCHER: Of course not.
T'POL: I am uncertain why I was chosen for this mission.
ARCHER: These people have never seen humans before. It makes sense for
someone with a familiar face to make the introductions.
T'POL: I have a lot of work to complete before the Vulcan ship arrives.
ARCHER: Don't worry, I'll get you back in plenty of time. I just
thought you might enjoy one final mission with your Captain. Or maybe I
should just take you back to Enterprise.
T'POL: We're only a few minutes from the capital. Returning to the ship
now would be a waste of fuel.
TUCKER [OC]: Enterprise to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead, Trip.
TUCKER [OC]: We're reading a ship closing on you, fast.
ARCHER: I got it.
T'POL: Some kind of fixed wing aircraft.
ARCHER: Did the Chancellor say anything about sending an escort? (hit
by weapons fire)
T'POL: I don't think they're an escort.
ALIEN [OC]: Alien vessel. Reduce to one quarter power and adjust
heading to three one seven mark five.
ARCHER: I'm taking evasive action. Bring the plasma weapons online.
T'POL: Ready.
ARCHER: Fire.
(They miss.)
 [Room]
 (Water pours through gaps in the roof, light
shines through holes in the corrugated walls.)
ARCHER: Houdini could get out of this.
(The pair are thoroughly trussed
up back to back, with bags over their heads.)
T'POL: Perhaps you should invite him on your next mission.
ARCHER: Harry Houdini was a magician, an escape artist. He was famous
for being able to free himself from any kind of restraint. Rope,
chains, anything.
T'POL: (struggling) That seems unlikely.
ARCHER: That's why he was called a magician. Some people say he was
double-jointed. I don't suppose Vulcans are double-jointed.
T'POL: Unfortunately not.
(A light comes on and the door is unlocked. The bags are removed from
their heads. Three people are there, male humanoids, bumpy foreheads,
slit down the nose, no upper lip.)
TRAEG: A Vulcan. What brings you to Coridan?
ARCHER: If you want answers, talk to me.
TRAEG: You're her superior?
ARCHER: That's right.
TRAEG: I don't recognize your species.
ARCHER: I'm human, from the planet Earth.
TRAEG: Never heard of Vulcans taking orders from anyone.
ARCHER: There's been a misunderstanding. We're here at the invitation
of your Chancellor.
TRAEG: She's not my Chancellor. That government is kept in power by the
Vulcans. If you're with them, you're on the wrong side.
(Traeg pulls a phase
pistol from his pocket.)
TRAEG: What kind of weapon is this? If you won't tell me
(He aims it at T'Pol.)
ARCHER: It's a phase pistol.
TRAEG: We'll put these to good use. I'm curious about your starship.
What can you tell me about it?
ARCHER: Our protein resequencer can make chicken sandwiches.
(He gets hit
for his cheek.)
T'POL: Stop! He's not a tactical officer. He's the ship's steward.
We're here to prepare a banquet for your Chancellor.
TRAEG: Your people have a reputation for truthfulness. You wouldn't be
lying to me, would you, Vulcan? Now I understand. You're the Captain,
aren't you?
T'POL: Perhaps.
TRAEG: Whoever you are, you picked the wrong time for a visit.
(The
group leaves, turning off the light.)
ARCHER: A steward?
 [Situation room]
 CHANCELLOR [on monitor]: We believe your shuttle
was forced down by members of a radical faction, but since the attack
took place outside our sensor grid, your officers won't be easy to
find.
TUCKER: You didn't tell us about any factions.
CHANCELLOR [on monitor]: They're a small group. We had no idea they
were capable of an attack like this. But be assured, Commander, your
people are almost certainly still alive.
REED: Almost certainly?
CHANCELLOR [on monitor]: The radicals will want something in exchange
for the hostages. They always do. Side arms, dicobalt explosives. It's
important that you don't give them anything.
REED: Is this how you protect your visitors?
TUCKER: You might have told us about your little war before you invited
us down.
CHANCELLOR [on monitor]: We're not at war, Commander. This is an
isolated incident.
TUCKER: I don't care what you call it. We just want to know where are
people are.
CHANCELLOR [on monitor]: We are doing everything in our power to find
them. (ends transmission)
TUCKER: We're not going to sit on our hands and wait for a ransom note.
Start scanning for human and Vulcan biosigns. (all walk forward to
their bridge stations)
HOSHI: There are billions of people down there. It could take days.
TRAVIS: It might be easier to locate the shuttlepod.
HOSHI: I'll try, but if the pod's been powered down it's almost
impossible to pick up its signature.
TUCKER: We've got to start somewhere.
 [Room]
 ARCHER: Ready?
T'POL: Yes.
ARCHER: Go.
(They try to stand by pushing against each other.)
ARCHER: Easy.
(With their feet tied together, it's difficult.)
ARCHER: Come on. Go.
(They try
again and fall on their sides.)
ARCHER: I think we got a little higher that
time.
T'POL: Only a few centimetres.
ARCHER: That's not frustration I hear in your voice.
T'POL: No.
ARCHER: Good. Let's try it again. One, two, three.
(They get back to a
sitting position.)
ARCHER: Ready?
T'POL: Yes.
ARCHER: Go.
(They succeed in standing.)
ARCHER:  I think these are starting to
come loose. How about yours?
T'POL: Slightly. If we can turn around, face each other.
ARCHER: We might be able to untie these knots. You'd think the Vulcan
database might have mentioned these people were fighting a civil war.
(T'Pol wriggles her way around his side within the ropes around their
waists.)
T'POL: The database is accurate. The Coridan government doesn't view
this as a civil war.
ARCHER: I imagine your people are going to want their database back,
too. Well, they can have it.
(They are finally face to face.)
ARCHER: Can you
reach the knot?
T'POL: I believe so. Without the database you wouldn't have found this
planet, or P'Jem.
ARCHER: You're not responsible for what happened. You didn't have any
idea that your people had installed a listening post, or that there
were Andorian commandos there.
T'POL: Enterprise had no good reason to visit a Vulcan sanctuary. I had
the opportunity to protest but I chose not to.
(Their wrists are now
untied.)
T'POL: It's clear that living among humans has caused my reasoning to
become compromised.
(They reach around each others waists to free
themselves.)
ARCHER: I think I understand. You're running away because you're afraid
to become one of us.
T'POL: I am not running away.
ARCHER: Then why aren't you fighting this transfer?
(Still reaching behind
each other,)
ARCHER: Your people took something away from my father that meant a
lot to him. They're not going to do the same thing to me.
(They
overbalance, and she lands on top on him. Finally they get free of each
other and start to release their own legs, but the door opens and a
guard comes in. Archer tackles him and takes him down.)
ARCHER: Go get his
weapon.
TRAEG: Stop!
 [Bridge]
 REED: It's definitely a ditanium signature about
four kilometres outside the capital.
TUCKER: It's practically under their noses.
REED: From what we can tell, the entire capital is surrounded by a
shanty town. There are almost as many biosigns on the outskirts as
there are inside the city.
TUCKER: Looks like these people have a lot to learn about building a
free society. Have you found human or Vulcan biosigns?
REED: Not yet.
TUCKER: What about the pod's transponder?
REED: They must have switched it off. Sir, I've got a rescue team
standing by in the launch bay.
TUCKER: Hold on, Malcolm. We don't even know if this is our pod. I
don't want to go down and find it's some alien tractor.
REED: It's our shuttlepod. I'm certain of it. All I'm suggesting is we
go down and have a look around.
HOSHI: Sir, we're being hailed. Audio only.
TUCKER: Who is it?
HOSHI: I can't tell.
TUCKER: Put them through.
TRAEG [OC]: Is this Enterprise?
TUCKER: Yes. And you are?
TRAEG [OC]: We're holding your Captain and your steward. In exchange
for their safe return we want forty of your phase weapons, the same
type we found aboard your shuttle. You'll be hailed at this time
tomorrow.
TUCKER: Wait, let me talk to the Captain.
TRAEG [OC]: I'm sure you wouldn't want any harm to come to her. We'll
rely on your full compliance.
TUCKER: Hello?
HOSHI: They've cut transmission.
TUCKER: Were you able to trace it?
HOSHI: They were using a triaxilating signal.
REED: They called the Captain 'her'. Are we sure they've got the right
hostages?
TRAVIS: At least it sounds like they're still alive.
REED: For how long? We don't have forty phase pistols, we've got
fifteen, and even if we give them to these people there's no guarantee
they'll keep their word. We know where the shuttle is. We have to send
a team down now while we still have the element of surprise.
HOSHI: We're getting another transmission.
TUCKER: Probably thought of something else they want.
HOSHI: It's not from the planet. It's coming from a Vulcan ship, the
Ni'Var.
TUCKER: Put it up.
SOPEK [on viewscreen]: Where's Captain Archer?
TUCKER: He's not here right now. Can I help you?
SOPEK [on viewscreen]: Inform him that we'll be arriving within the
hour.
TUCKER: You guys made great time. We weren't expecting you until
tomorrow.
SOPEK [on viewscreen]: You obviously made an error in your
calculations. Please have Sub-commander T'Pol ready to depart when we
arrive.
TUCKER: We've got a bit of a problem. She's not here either. She and
the Captain were on their way to the capital city when they were
kidnapped.
SOPEK [on viewscreen]: How convenient.
TUCKER: I'm telling you, they were kidnapped.
SOPEK [on viewscreen]: How do you know this?
TUCKER: Maybe the ransom demand we just received gave us a clue. They
threatened to kill them both if we didn't give them what they want.
SOPEK [on viewscreen]: It would be irrational to kill the hostages.
They would lose their negotiating position.
TUCKER: Maybe we're not dealing with the most rational people down
there, did you consider that?
SOPEK [on viewscreen]: Since the situation involves a Vulcan officer,
we will take over the investigation. It would be best if you refrained
from any foolish endeavours.
TUCKER: What the hell's that supposed
(Transmission ends.)
TUCKER: I'm getting
real sick of being cut off.
 [Situation room]
 SOPEK: Your vessel is ill-equipped to mount a
rescue mission. You would most likely become captives yourselves. My
team will penetrate their base of operations.
TUCKER: What does that mean?
REED: Sounds to me like you're planning an assault.
TUCKER: Did it ever occur to you that that could get the Captain and
T'Pol killed?
SOPEK: We've dealt with this sort of threat in the past. Swift,
decisive action is the logical response.
TUCKER: You're awfully trigger-happy for someone who's repressed his
emotions.
SOPEK: They've threatened the life of a Vulcan officer. We must
discourage any such incidents in the future.
REED: This isn't your planet. Maybe the Coridan government has
something to say about this.
SOPEK: I've already been in contact with the Chancellor. She's given me
full authority to implement this action.
TUCKER: You don't really care what happens to them, do you? You
probably wouldn't mind if they got caught in the crossfire. You'd
consider it payback for what happened at P'Jem.
SOPEK: It is not Vulcan policy to negotiate with terrorists.
(Sopek turns to
leave.)
TUCKER: Not even if it saves lives?
SOPEK: Any data you may have on the location of your Captain and the
Sub-Commander would be useful.
TUCKER: Sorry, we don't have anything.
(The Vulcans leave.)
TUCKER: Warm up the
shuttlepod.
 [Room]
 (The pair are even more thoroughly tied, with
ropes connecting ankles to knees and wrists and then to necks. A guard
brings them a plate of food each and places it at their feet.)
ARCHER: We can't eat like this.
(The guard leaves.)
ARCHER: Friendly.
(He has to lie
down on the floor to get a finger to the bowl.)
ARCHER: Can you pick up yours?
T'POL: No.
(Archer takes a lick of the stuff on the plate.)
ARCHER: Dig in,
Sub-commander. I don't think you'll be able to send this back for some
plomeek broth.
T'POL: I'm not hungry.
ARCHER: I didn't ask if you were hungry. You need to keep up your
strength, so eat. That's an order.
(She lies down and dips a finger in
the stuff. Archer discovers a red flashing light in his bowl.)
ARCHER: Look at
this.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: We're being hailed. It's the Vulcans.
TRAVIS: Here we go.
SOPEK [on viewscreen]: This is Sopek. Where's Commander Tucker?
HOSHI: He's unavailable at the moment. Can I take a message?
SOPEK [on viewscreen]: I want to know where that shuttlepod was going.
HOSHI: What shuttlepod is that?
SOPEK [on viewscreen]: The one that left your launch bay nine minutes
ago.
HOSHI: I really wouldn't know, sir. We get shuttlepods coming and going
all the time. It's a little like Union Station around here.
(She starts
messing with the transmission frequency on her board.)
SOPEK [on viewscreen]: I want to know where Commander Tucker is.
HOSHI: I'm sorry, your transmission's breaking up.
 [Shanty town]
 TUCKER: I guess not everyone gets to live in
Emerald City.
REED: Yeah.
(They get jumped and dragged off with bags over their heads.)
 [Another room]
 (The bags are removed.)
SHRAN: You should have listened to the Vulcan. He warned you against
doing anything foolish.
TUCKER: What the hell are you doing here?
SHRAN: Looking out for you pink skins. If you had gone anywhere near
that shuttlepod, you'd have been killed.
THOLOS: They left it in the open for you to find.
TUCKER: How do you know what Sopek told me? That was a secure
transmission.
SHRAN: Sopek is the senior Vulcan officer in the sector. Naturally, we
keep him under close surveillance. We've been monitoring all Vulcan
transmissions and ship deployments since the incident at P'Jem. We know
they're preparing for a war against us.
TUCKER: I'm no fan of the Vulcans, but they're not warmongers.
SHRAN: There's already a war going on, and the Vulcans are in the
middle of it. Several rebel factions here are working to overthrow
their government, a corrupt government that has very close ties to your
peace loving, logical friends.
REED: So, you and the rebels figure you both have a common enemy.
SHRAN: The hostage-takers have no plans to return your Captain or the
female. Once you deliver the weapons, they'll be killed. Fortunately
for you, we have a relationship with the down-trodden here.
TUCKER: You tried to kill us last time we met. Why are you trying to
help us now?
SHRAN: I haven't slept well since our encounter at the Vulcan
sanctuary. I don't like being indebted to anyone, least of all your
Captain.
(Tholos unties the pair.)
TUCKER: You're right. You never would have found that spy station
without his help.
SHRAN: Once he's free, my debt will be repaid in full. Show them.
(Tholos brings up images on a monitor.)
SHRAN: Your people are being held here.
These are barracks for the guards.
REED: How many?
THOLOS: At least four inside the compound, two more up on the wall
here, and two guards outside the gate. All armed with particle weapons.
TUCKER: How'd you get this level of detail?
SHRAN: We have an operative inside the compound.
REED: Unless he's going to take out these guards, you're not going to
have an easy time getting all the way to the hostages.
(Shran gets weapons from a box.)
SHRAN: It's not your concern.
TUCKER: It is if you get the Captain killed. You're outnumbered four to
one. Wouldn't you like to improve those odds?
THOLOS: They could be useful.
SHRAN: Give them their weapons.
 [Room]
 TUCKER [OC]: Captain, can you hear me?
ARCHER: Trip?
TUCKER [OC]: It's me and Malcolm, sir. We're about half a kilometre
away.
ARCHER: Just the two of you?
TUCKER [OC]: Not exactly. We met up with some old friends down here.
Andorians. Apparently, one of them thinks he owes you a favour.
ARCHER: He couldn't have picked a better time.
TUCKER [OC]: One of the people guarding you is working with them. When
he unties you, head for the gate. It's about twenty metres from the
building you're in. Until he shows up, just sit tight.
ARCHER: That won't be a problem.
 [Compound gate]
 TUCKER: Cold, isn't it? Andorian ale?
(Tucker offers a
bottle to two sentry guards.)
TUCKER: It'll warm you up.
(One takes a swig while
the inside man sneaks past and peels back some corrugated sheeting to
let Shran and Tholos in. Putting the metal back makes a noise.)
GUARD: Who's that?
TUCKER: Oh, it's just my friend. Nothing to
(One guard goes to
investigate, the other slams Tucker against the wall, interrupting his dialogue.)
TUCKER: Get off me. Hey,
let me go.
(More guards are attracted to the disturbance, and Tucker knocks out
his assailant with the bottle while the Andorians take out two more.
Reed joins Trip at the gate and Shran lets them in. They head in but
there is an explosion at the gate.)
TUCKER: What the hell is going on?
(Vulcans come through the hole they've created and start a gun fight
with the remaining guards.)
 [Room]
 (Shran's agent comes to free Archer and T'Pol but
gets shot in the back.)
ARCHER: Get down.
(They lie on the floor.)
 [Compound]
 SHRAN: Vulcans! Did you know they were planning to
do this?
TUCKER: You're the ones who have their comm. system bugged.
REED: Our escape plan's shot to hell.
TUCKER: We've got to get them out of there.
(Shran and Trip run for the room Archer and T'Pol are in while Reed
gives covering fire against the Coridans)
 [Room]
 TUCKER: Good to see you, Captain.
ARCHER: What's going on?
Tucker unties Archer while Shran frees T'Pol.)
TUCKER: Vulcans crashed our
rescue party.
ARCHER: (getting a hand up from Shran) Thanks.
SHRAN: I believe this is yours. It's the scanner she gave me from the
Vulcan listening post.
ARCHER: Seems you went to a lot of trouble to return it.
SHRAN: I'm here for only one reason. I need a good night's sleep. My
debt is repaid.
(The Vulcans bring in a howitzer and the fight is over.)
 [Compound]
 SOPEK: Your presence here is a violation of the
Tau Ceti Accords.
SHRAN: You lecture us about treaty violations?
SOPEK: Put down your weapons!
SHRAN: I know better than to lower my guard around Vulcans.
ARCHER: Look, we're all on the same side here.
(T'Pol sees Traeg aim a weapon at Sopek, so she moves to push him aside
and gets shot in the back herself. Shran and Tholos shoot the would-be
assassin.)
ARCHER: Let's get her to the ship.
SOPEK: She's no longer your responsibility. We'll treat her on the
Ni'Var.
(Archer picks T'Pol up.)
ARCHER:
She's still my Science Officer. Is the pod
close?
REED: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: Let's go.
(They head out.)
SHRAN: (to Sopek) You should be the one dying, not her.
 [Sickbay]
 SOPEK: How is she?
PHLOX: Her injuries were quite extensive.
SOPEK: Will she live?
PHLOX: I wish I could say.
ARCHER: I know how you must feel. She saved my life once too. She can
be a real pain in the ass. Stubborn, arrogant. Sometimes she makes me
angry enough, I want to shove her out an airlock. I can understand why
the High Command's upset, but it took a lot of courage to step in front
of that plasma bullet. Do you really want to take her back home in
disgrace?
SOPEK: Nothing can excuse what she did at the sanctuary.
ARCHER: I'm not asking anyone to pin a medal on her. All I'm asking is
that she be given a second chance. If a respected Vulcan captain went
before the High Command and made a plea on T'Pol's behalf, told them
how she saved the life of a superior officer, wouldn't they think twice
about this transfer?
SOPEK: I can't return without her.
PHLOX: She's suffered extreme trauma. I wouldn't advise moving her for
quite some time.
SOPEK: I'm meeting with the High Command in three days. Perhaps, if
there's time, I'll discuss this matter with them.
ARCHER: Thank you.
(Sopek and his aide leave. T'Pol has been
revived by a hypospray and is trying to sit up.)
T'POL: What happened?
ARCHER: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You were shot. Don't you remember?
T'POL: Captain Sopek?
ARCHER: He's all right, thanks to you.
T'POL: I'd like to return to my quarters.
PHLOX: I'm afraid you're going to have to stay here at least another
twenty four hours.
(Phlox leaves them.)
ARCHER: You made quite an impression on Sopek. I've got a feeling he's
going to talk to the High Command about that transfer order. I'd say
the odds are pretty good you're going to be with us for a while longer.
T'POL: You should have consulted me first.
ARCHER: It's probably not too late if you want to catch up to him.
T'POL: That won't be possible. Leaving Sickbay would violate my
doctor's orders.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Shuttlepod One
Shuttlepod
One
 Mission date: 9 Nov, 2151
Original Airdate: Feb 13, 2002
  [Shuttlepod]
 REED: The Captain said they'd be mapping this
asteroid field, but I can't see head nor tails of them.
TUCKER: Maybe it's another asteroid field.
REED: No, this is the one. Two primaries, seventeen planetesimals. (Tucker is examining a circuit with a laser.)
TUCKER: Well, they weren't expecting
us back for three days. Maybe they finished and went off to do
something else.
REED: Well, with our sensor array down, we won't know when they get
back until we see them. Any luck with the comm?
TUCKER: Dead as a doornail. I don't understand it.
REED: Well, no doubt you'll have your boys take this pod apart piece by
piece once it's back in the launch bay.
TUCKER: I'd feel a lot more comfortable having everything in working
order by the time Enterprise gets back.
REED: Well, tinker all you like. I've got a copy of Ulysses here. I
doubt I'll even be halfway through it by the time the ship gets back.
TUCKER: I'd rather realign every micro-circuit on this shuttle than try
to wade through that baby.
REED: British schools have a core curriculum. It serves to provide a
well-rounded education. Sometimes I think you North Americans read
nothing but comic books and those ridiculous science fiction novels.
TUCKER: I'll have you know that Superman was laced with metaphor.
Subtext layered on subtext.
REED: Oh, if only Doctor Cochrane had been a European. The Vulcans
would have been far less reticent to help us. But, no, he had to be
from Montana. He probably spent his nights reading about cowboys and
Indians.
TUCKER: Well, I don't recall any Europeans figuring out how to build a
warp engine. (Reed is looking out the main window.)
REED: Commander.
TUCKER: No Brits, no Italians, no Serbo-Croatians.
REED: Commander. I think you'd better come and take a look at this.
(They are passing an asteroid with a big crash site on it.)
TUCKER: Bring us in closer.
REED: Is it a ship?
TUCKER: If the damn sensors were only working, we could. Bring us
around again. There. Slow down.
(The sight of a piece of metal with 01 on it brings a lump to their
throats)
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in. How are the Tesnians doing?
HOSHI: Dr. Phlox can only keep twelve of them in the Decon chamber at a
time.
ARCHER: What about the other, what is it, twenty two?
HOSHI: He's rotating them. They seem to be doing fine on our atmosphere
but they need at least six hours of boron gas a day. He says we've got
enough to get them home.
ARCHER: Have you learned their language?
HOSHI: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: What do they have to say?
HOSHI: They're pretty rattled. Most of them have been on that ship for
years. It's a lot to digest they lost everything.
ARCHER: They're alive. Does the Captain have any idea what happened?
HOSHI: No, and he feels terrible about the damage to Enterprise. He has
no idea what went wrong. When they approached our docking port they
lost control of their sensor array, and then a few seconds later their
navigation system went out.
ARCHER: Thank God their escape pods were working.
HOSHI: I saw the wreckage on the asteroid. There wasn't much left.
ARCHER: Archer to Mayweather. What's our ETA?
TRAVIS [OC]: We should reach Tesnia in about twenty hours, sir.
ARCHER: Good work. That should get us back to our rendezvous
co-ordinates well before Trip and Malcolm get there. Let's drop out of
warp for a few minutes. I want to inspect the damage to the launch
doors.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
 [Inspection pod]
 (Smaller and rounder than a shuttlepod, with no
wings for atmosphere flight.)
ARCHER: Who's in charge of Engineering while Trip's away?
T'POL: Lieutenant Hess.
ARCHER: Tell her to get a team working on a new starboard door for
launch bay two. (They glide underneath the gaping hole and twisted
metal where the launch door used to be.) ARCHER: Everything else check out all
right?
T'POL: Astrometrics detected what could be micro-singularities in the
vicinity of the asteroid field.
ARCHER: Micro-singularities are a Vulcan myth. There's no scientific
evidence that they exist.
T'POL: Our deflectors registered some unusual charged particles at the
same time the Tesnian ship began to malfunction.
ARCHER: Any similar damage on Enterprise?
T'POL: No, but our hull plating was polarised.
ARCHER: Micro-singularities. If the Vulcans had their way they'd blame
them for the common cold.
 [Shuttlepod]
 TUCKER: How about the lifeboats? They could have
launched the lifeboats before the crash.
REED: They'd be here. They only go three hundred kph. They'd be right
here waiting for us to return.
TUCKER: Are we sure there are no survivors?
REED: Commander, we have to figure out what we're going to do.
TUCKER: We can't just leave. That's Enterprise. At least we should find
the black boxes.
REED: With what? We have no radio. Nothing to pick up the beacons.
TUCKER: What's the range in our distress beacon?
REED: It's offline.
TUCKER: I'm talking about the portable one. The one in the away kit.
REED: Ten million kilometers, maybe twenty, but I highly doubt there'd
be a ship anywhere close to that.
TUCKER: We've only got ten days worth of breathable air. How far to
Echo Three?
REED: At impulse? A lot more than ten days.
TUCKER: Well, if we could get close enough for it to pick up our
distress beacon it'd relay the signal back to Starfleet.
REED: I'm afraid the math doesn't work out, Commander. It's going to
take weeks, maybe months for our signal to reach Echo Three. By the
time Starfleet got a ship out here we'd be, we'd be long dead.
TUCKER: But at least they'd find us. They'd get their shuttlepod back,
a couple of well-preserved corpses.
REED: Sir.
TUCKER: Which way?
REED: Which way to what?
TUCKER: Echo Three. Which way to Echo Three?
REED: I told you, it's too far.
TUCKER: Do you know which direction it is or don't you?
REED: Navigation is down.
TUCKER: That's not what I asked you.
REED: You want me to guess?
TUCKER: You come from a long line of Navy men and you got a real good
memory. Look hard at those stars, find something that looks familiar
and tell me which way to go.
REED: Sir.
TUCKER: That's an order!
REED: I don't suppose you have a sextant handy.
TUCKER: I left it with my slide rule. (Reed sits in the pilot's seat)
Well?
REED: That blue giant, we may have gone by it. I'm not sure.
TUCKER: That's good enough for me. Take one more low pass over the
wreckage and then set a course. (They swoop down over the 01 sign.) TUCKER: See
you around, Captain.
(Later- )
REED: Personal log, Lieutenant Malcolm Reed. November 9, 2151. By the
time anyone hears this, by anyone, I suppose I mean anyone human,
Commander Tucker and I will be long dead. It's my intention to recount
the events that led to the destruction of the Starship Enterprise and
to express my deepest feelings regarding my short but memorable service
with Starfleet.
TUCKER: Tell them I'd love to add my two cents, but I'm trying to get a
little work done. (Reed rewinds a little.)
REED: [OC] short but memorable service with
Starfleet. (He resumes dictation.) REED: In order to test the targeting scanners
on Shuttlepod one, Commander Tucker and I had to get at least twenty
thousand kilometres from Enterprise. During our third trial, we
experienced a brief but sizable jolt, and shortly thereafter realised
that our sensor array had gone offline.
TUCKER: This sensor array is more than offline. It's totally fried.
REED: (rewinds) that our sensor array had gone offline. (resumes) We
had no choice but to head back to the asteroid field where Enterprise
was involved in a mapping project. We found the ship destroyed, its
debris strewn across a square kilometre of one of the larger asteroids.
Had our sensors been working we certainly would have done everything
possible to determine the cause of the disaster, but as it was, with
only a short-range distress beacon and limited air, we had no
alternative but to set a course for Echo Three where someday this
vessel and eventually this log, will be found. May God have mercy on
our souls.
TUCKER: Why don't you cut the crap and get back here and help me?
REED: What would you like me to do?
TUCKER: I don't know. You could hold this flashlight, or turn down the
heat. Whatever you want. I'm just getting a little tired of listening
to all your pessimism.
REED: If there's something you need me to do I would be more than happy
to comply, but I'm afraid pessimism is simply not an accurate
description of my log entry. I'm just being realistic, Commander.
TUCKER: We've got nine days. We're bound to find someone out here.
REED: At warp, perhaps, but at impulse?
TUCKER: Vulcans, Klingons, Suliban, Xyrillians, Andorians. God knows
who's going to be lurking around the next planet we run into.
REED: But that's just it, sir. At impulse, we're not likely to be
running into any planets. Not for at least six or seven years.
TUCKER: Then somebody can run into us. You ever think of that? Or see
us on their sensors. The possibilities are endless.
REED: I'll heat up some rations. Unless of course you'd rather wait
until we run into a vessel serving proper meals.
TUCKER: Rations will be fine. (Reed takes a small box out of a cubby hole.)
REED: What are you in the
mood for?
TUCKER: Depends. What are you serving? (Reed reads the labels.)
REED: Veal marsala. Chilean sea bass. Moo Goo Gai Pan.
TUCKER: Any meat loaf?
REED: With gravy and mashed potatoes.
TUCKER: Perfect. (Reed finds a bottle stashed in the cubby hole, too.)
REED: Kentucky bourbon.
TUCKER: Yeah, the Captain was planning to give that to somebody. Can't
remember who. Guess it's ours now.
(Reed puts the meals into the heater, and a couple of seconds later they
are eating hot food from plastic trays.)
TUCKER: What's that?
REED: The sea bass.
TUCKER: Any good?
REED: It's lovely. Thank you.
(Later again, Trip is trying to sleep but Reed is still doing
dictation.)
REED: Captain Archer claims you told him you weren't even aware that I
was serving on Enterprise. I find that difficult to believe,
considering I wrote you twice in the weeks prior to our departure. Now,
it is possible that you never received those letters. You were, I
believe, in the process of moving back to Malaysia at the time. But you
must have spoken to Aunt Sherry during that period, and I know she
received my letters. I would hate to go to my death thinking that
either of you felt I was trying to avoid
TUCKER: Malcolm! You've been at it for hours now. Don't you think it's
time to give it a rest?
REED: As I'm sure you must have heard that was my esteemed colleague,
Commander Charles Tucker. Mister Tucker doesn't share my belief that it
is essential to say what must be said, to leave a record, tie up loose
ends. Mister Tucker is labouring under the false hope that we are going
to be miraculously rescued before we both suffocate.
TUCKER: Mister and Mrs. Reed, I realise that you've just begun a period
of mourning and that I'll never get an answer to this question, but I
got to ask it anyway. Was Malcolm always this cynical?
REED: In a few days, when the reality of this situation actually begins
to sink in, you might very well decide you want to record some logs of
your own. You have my word, I will not interrupt you.
TUCKER: I just need to get some sleep, Malcolm! Is that so hard to
understand?
REED: We have less than nine days of oxygen left. It seems a waste to
use it up sleeping.
TUCKER: If I don't waste some oxygen sleeping, I'm going to start
getting real cranky, and you don't want to spend your last nine days
cooped up with me when I'm cranky. So turn that thing off and get some
rest.
 [Sickbay]
 REED: We're back.
PHLOX: Lie still, Lieutenant.
REED: What happened? How did we?
ARCHER: You're a very brave man, Malcolm. Commander Tucker's going to
be fine, thanks to you.
REED: I'm afraid I don't understand.
PHLOX: Get some rest. There will be plenty of time to explain what
happened in the morning. (the two men leave)
REED: Sub-Commander?
T'POL: How are you feeling?
REED: I'd feel a lot better if I knew what was going on.
T'POL: Captain Archer would be quite annoyed with me if I told you of
your heroics. I believe he's looking forward to doing that himself in
the morning.
REED: Heroics?
T'POL: I had no idea you could be so selfless in the face of such
danger. Most males of your species would have given in to their fear.
REED: Well, since you're obviously not going to tell me what happened I
suppose a simple good night will have to do.
T'POL: Vulcans can never ignore courage. (She sits on the bed and takes his
hand.)T'POL:  And this Vulcan will never ignore Lieutenant Malcolm Reed again.
REED: I can't say I've ever ignored you, T'Pol. Is it all right if I
call you T'Pol?
T'POL: Yes. May I call you Malcolm?
REED: I suppose so. But, if the truth be known, I've never much cared
for the name Malcolm. Always seemed a bit too stuffy.
T'POL: I think it's a lovely name. Mol-Kom is the Vulcan word for
serenity.
REED: Well, then, perhaps I won't change it. Pity, though. I was rather
growing fond of the name Stinky. I can't believe you just did that.
T'POL: Did what?
REED: You smiled. I saw you smile.
T'POL: Vulcans don't smile.
REED: This one does. I saw you. (T'Pol leans closer and closer.)
T'POL You're mistaken.
REED: It was when I said Stinky, wasn't it? You smiled when I said
Stinky. Good morning, Stinky. It's a lovely day,` isn't it, Stinky?
(She laughs gently and then they almost kiss when a whistle sound goes
off.) REED: What's that?
 [Shuttlepod]
 TUCKER: I got the receiver working but the
transmitter's a lost cause. Who's Stinky?
REED: (sitting up) I beg your pardon?
TUCKER: You were talking in your sleep. You kept calling for some guy
named Stinky.
REED: You repaired the receiver. What is that? Is it a ship?
TUCKER: You know, the range is very limited. It's probably just white
noise. The sound of the galaxy laughing at us.
(the shuttlepod is hit, and shakes about)
REED: What the hell was that?
TUCKER: I don't know, but it felt a little like whatever knocked out
the sensor array.
REED: We're losing atmosphere. Pressure's down eight percent.
TUCKER: Help me. We've got to find the hole.
REED: Without sensors it's not going to be easy to locate the breach.
TUCKER: Then use your ears.
REED: Pressure's down twenty two percent.
TUCKER: The damn hole's too small.
REED: Where is it? (Tucker rips open a ceiling panel.) REED: What are you
doing?
TUCKER: It's nitrogen for the coolant tanks. Just give me a few
seconds. (He fills the pod with opaque gas.) TUCKER: Now let's find that leak. (Reed spots where the gas is being sucked out.) REED: I got it. It's over
here.
TUCKER: There's another one down here. Put your finger on it until we
can figure out what to do.
REED: We've got some valve sealant in storage bin three.
TUCKER: Have we got anything a little closer?
REED: Do you mind passing your meat loaf?
TUCKER: What?(The two food trays still have remains in them.)
REED: I assume you've finished with it. (Trip uses his feet to get the
tray off the bench and push it over to Reed, who puts his boot into the
mash and then uses it to block first his tiny hole and then the other
one.)
TUCKER: And you came close to criticising my choice of cuisine.
Obviously, whatever hit us went clear through the pod. (Reed checks a readout.)
REED: I'm afraid it did more than just puncture
the cabin, Commander. On it's way out it was kind enough to rupture one
of the O2 cylinders.
TUCKER: Great. How much closer to oblivion are we?
REED: We've got less than two days of air left.
(Later, replacing the mash with proper sealant)
REED: The skin of this pod is designed to deflect a meteor five times
the size of this hole.
TUCKER: In that case, I'd guess it wasn't a meteor. I wonder if
something like it destroyed Enterprise.
REED: We'll never know.
TUCKER: Always the optimist.
REED: We have forty hours of air left. What do you expect me to do, sit
here and plan my wedding?
TUCKER: I'm confident there'll be a Charles Tucker the fourth one day.
REED: Then maybe it's your wedding we should be planning. That's
assuming we can find you a bride in the next day and a half. Any
suggestions?
TUCKER: There was a little bar in Mill Valley where all the Starfleet
trainees used to go.
REED: The 602 Club.
TUCKER: You know it?
REED: I was there more times than I can remember.
TUCKER: I met the girl of my dreams my first Friday night there. She
was the one. There's no doubt about it. We had it all figured out.
Where we'd live, how many kids we'd have. Ah, Ruby. Whatever happened
to you?
REED: Ruby? You don't mean the waitress Ruby?
TUCKER: You knew Ruby?
REED: I knew her more times than I can remember.
TUCKER: Ouch.
REED: Seems we have more in common than we thought.
TUCKER: Yeah. (checks readout) Would another half day be worth freezing
your butt off?
REED: What are you talking about?
TUCKER: If we lower the thermostat in here to about minus-five
centigrade, we should be able to use that power to enhance the
efficiency of the atmosphere recyclers.
REED: Our last two and a half days freezing versus our last two days
toasty warm. What a delightful choice.
TUCKER: I'd pick freezing. Another half day's another half day.
REED: Freezing it is then. (He hangs up a mirror.)
TUCKER: And just what are you doing?
REED: An officer at his best is always well-groomed. (And starts shaving.)
TUCKER: Nice to see you're developing a more positive attitude.
REED: Actually, I was thinking about what our corpses would look like
when they're eventually found. With no air in the pod, we should remain
in fairly good condition.
TUCKER: Charming, but you're forgetting one thing, Malcolm.
REED: What's that?
TUCKER: If I remember my honours biology course correctly, your hair
and nails keep growing for quite a while after you're dead. I'm pretty
sure that includes your beard. (Reed turns off the shaver. By the way, that is false. It just that the skin shrinks slightly, creating that illusion.)
REED: Thanks.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in.
T'POL: I've analyzed the scans we took of the Tesnian ship right before
it crashed. I believe they were hit by a micro-singularity.
ARCHER: You still chasing gremlins?
T'POL: This is no myth, Captain. Three of the singularities also hit
Enterprise. They collided with our hull plating here, here and here.
ARCHER: You're telling me these are tiny black holes?
T'POL: They were. The dispersal pattern suggests they dissipated on
impact. This could be a significant discovery, Captain. If we could get
quantum sensor readings of the three impact points, we could
authenticate our findings.
ARCHER: I'd be a little less concerned with winning the Nobel Prize
right now and a little more concerned with Trip and Malcolm. Their
shuttlepod doesn't have the hull plating we do. They could be in for a
rough ride when they get back to the asteroid field. Better hail them.
Agree to a new rendezvous point.
T'POL: I never intended to suggest that our crewmembers were less
important than a scientific discovery. Even one of this historic
magnitude.
ARCHER: Time's a-wasting.
 [Shuttlepod]
 (It's now minus 5C, baseball caps are firmly on
and jackets zipped up to the chin.)
REED: My dearest Deborah. By this time I'm certain you've learned of
the tragedy that befell the starship Enterprise. You've also
undoubtedly learned that my colleague, Commander Charles Tucker, and I
did manage to survive for a few days after the accident. It's during
that brief time that I've chosen to correspond with you. Although our
relationship was short-lived, and at times tumultuous, I can't help but
picture your beautiful smile. It gives me great comfort. Think of me
from time to time. Cordially, Malcolm. (There is static on the comm.) REED: A ship?
TUCKER: It's a little more modulated than the last one, but it could be
just a random gamma-ray burst.
REED: My dearest Rochelle. By this time I'm certain you've learned of
the tragedy
TUCKER: Wouldn't it be easier just to record one message and then add
the Dear Whoever afterward? This is your fifth or sixth identical
letter.
REED: That's not true. There have been subtle differences. I would
never refer to Rochelle as having a beautiful smile. With her, it was
the eyes.
TUCKER: Travis and Hoshi couldn't have been more than twenty four or
twenty five years old.
REED: If the Captain were here with us now I wonder if he'd feel guilty
about bringing them on this mission.
TUCKER: Not for a minute. They died doing what they loved.
REED: I don't remember Hoshi loving much about being in deep space.
TUCKER: She was coming along. She saved our asses on more than one
occasion. I plan on letting her family know just how essential she was.
REED: Sounds to me like you do have some letters to record.
TUCKER: I'll wait to tell them in person.
REED: You know, your treacly optimism is beginning to get just a little
bit tiresome.
TUCKER: Unlike your heartfelt letters of farewell to half the girls in
San Francisco?
REED: At least I'm capable of accepting our fate. We're going to be
dead in about thirty three33 hours. Whether our beards continue to grow
or not is of no concern to me. We will be dead! And unless some ship
happens to cross our path, our bearded bodies will be discovered in
about three or four years. Is that optimistic enough for you?
TUCKER: What's your problem with having a little hope?
REED: What's your problem with facing the truth?
TUCKER: You're a regular grim reaper, Malcolm. Anyone ever tell you
that? Well, if this little trip is a death sentence, then it would seem
to me we're entitled to a last meal. What'll it be? I'm afraid our
selection is somewhat limited.
REED: I'm not hungry. (Tucker gets out the bourbon.)
TUCKER: Well, then how about a drink?
REED: I don't drink on duty.
TUCKER: Are you serious? We're dead men, remember? What's the matter,
Lieutenant? Are you afraid the autopsy will show your blood-alcohol
level was too high to pilot a shuttle? (Tucker gets out glasses and pours two
slugs.) TUCKER: Live a little. That's an order.(He raises a floor panel into a low
table, gets something out from underneath, puts a wick in it and lights
it.)
REED: Do you really think that's going to provide any heat?
TUCKER: The bourbon'll provide the heat. The candle's just for mood. To
the brave men and women of the starship Enterprise.
REED: You know that's going to consume oxygen, don't you?
TUCKER: We'll probably be dead five or six minutes earlier than we
would have been. I can live with that. Anyway, it seems to me as far as
you're concerned, the sooner the better.
REED: Is that really how you see me? The eternal pessimist? The grim
reaper? I don't want to die. What makes you think I want to die?
TUCKER: Because ever since we saw Enterprise spread across that
asteroid, you've done nothing but write your own obituary.
REED: I lost nearly everyone I cared about on that ship. Those girls I
talked about. Rochelle, Deborah, Catelin. None of them worked out
because I could never get very close to them. Never got very close to
my family either, for that matter, not that it's any business of yours.
But with the crew of the Enterprise, it was different. I was really
starting to feel comfortable with them, and now the only one that's
left thinks I'm the bloody angel of death. (Tucker blows out candle.)
TUCKER: All of a sudden, five or six more minutes
sounds kind of nice.
(Three quarters of a bottle later, speech is slurred and thermal
blankets are wrapped around bodies.)
REED: Does that sound modulated enough for you?
TUCKER: Modulated?
REED: The radio. Or is it just the galaxy giggling at us again? (He takes
another drink.)
TUCKER: It can giggle all it wants, but the galaxy's not getting any of
our bourbon.
Deleted scene
REED: You know, it's funny. I was just beginning to think that Captain
Archer was invincible, you know? Just serving on the same starship as
him made me feel safe for some reason. He had a knack for getting us
out of trouble, didn't he.
TUCKER: Yeah, he's always been that way. When I first taught him to
dive, it really got on my nerves. He'd come down to the Keys at least
once a month, and whatever it was I was teaching him, he'd get it the
first time. Did you ever try clearing your mask?
REED: Clear my mask?
TUCKER: Everybody's got to do it before they get certified. You go down
and the instructor fills your mask with water, and you have to clear it
by blowing out through your nose. Nobody likes to do it.
REED: The Captain?
TUCKER: Got it the first time. Filled it with water a second time just
so he could clear it again. I took him on a night dive once into some
caves I'd been to a hundred times before, and for some reason I got a
little lost. So what does Archer do? He swims ahead of me and finds a
way out.
REED: I can't imagine why you'd have a problem with that.
TUCKER: I was the instructor. I'd been diving all my life. Then big
Mister Starfleet comes down and does everything faster and better than
I could. That's when I decided to introduce him to old Waldo.
REED: And who was that?
TUCKER: A green moray. It's said he's thirty years old. Must've been
two and a half metres long. So I took the Captain into Waldo's hole.
Told him there was some beautiful starfish inside, and he reached in.
Damned if old Waldo didn't take hold of his forearm.
REED: A moray eel? Are you out of your mind. (Reed is still drinking.)
TUCKER: I was breaking just about every rule in the book, but he was
wearing titanium mesh. I figures the worst thing that could happen
would be that Waldo would scare him a little. He deserved to have the
piss taken out of him.
REED: So?
TUCKER: No such luck. He pulled Waldo clear out of the hole. I don't
think I'd ever seen that eel's tail before. He found some pressure
point under it's lower jaw, right about here. Waldo just let go. Went
back down his hole.
REED: That must have been the last time the Captain ever went diving
with you.
TUCKER: That's the thing. He found it all funnier than I did. He took
me out to dinner that night. Steaks, lobsters, Kentucky bourbon.
 REED: Hey, what do you think of T'Pol, hmm? Do you
think she's pretty?
TUCKER: T'Pol? Are you serious?
REED: Well, she's a woman, you know? I think she's pretty.
TUCKER: You've had too much to drink.
REED: Don't tell me you've never looked at her, you know, in that way.
TUCKER: Nah, she's a Vulcan.
REED: Well, I think she's pretty.
TUCKER: Oh, God.
REED: You ever noticed her bum?
TUCKER: What?
REED: Her bum. She's got an awfully nice bum.
TUCKER: To Sub-Commander T'Pol.
REED: Awfully nice! (The comm. crackles again.) REED: It's probably nothing,
right?
(Tucker scrambles into the pilot's seat.) TUCKER: It's definitely not nothing.
REED: Well then, that means it's something. What is it? Well, is it
something or someone, because if it's someone
TUCKER: Shush!
REED: Sorry.
TUCKER: Definitely someone.
REED: We have no way to respond, do we. This is like the plane flying
over the desert island in a lost-at-sea movie.
TUCKER: Malcolm!
REED: Sorry. Happy endings. I must think happy endings.
HOSHI [OC}: Shuttlepod one, this is Enterprise. Please respond.
TUCKER: That's Hoshi!
HOSHI [OC]: Transmitting new co-ordinates.
TUCKER: That's impossible!
REED: Don't be so pessimistic. It's not impossible. It's Hoshi. They're
okay. Enterprise is okay. It's Hoshi!
HOSHI [OC]: Adjust your heading to the new coordinates. We will
rendezvous in two days. Commander and Lieutenant, please respond.
REED: Rendezvous. What a beautiful word. What's wrong?
TUCKER: They're still two days away.
REED: And we only have a little more than one day's air left.
TUCKER: And no way to tell them to get here sooner.
(Later, and the pair have lost a lot of their body heat thanks to the
alcohol.)
TUCKER: Are you sure you got the coordinates right?
REED: Yes, not that it matters.
TUCKER: Lieutenant.
REED: They're probably travelling at what, warp two, warp three?
Compared to them, we're like a garden snail. Where we go and how fast
we get there is irrelevant.
TUCKER: If I purge the CO2 filters it'll give us a little more air.
REED: How much? An hour's worth?
TUCKER: Probably less.
REED: Great. So when they reach us in two days we'll have been out of
air for eleven hours. You ever try holding your breath for eleven
hours?
TUCKER: A train leaves New York at three a.m. heading west, while
another leaves Chicago at four thirty heading east. I never could
figure those out.
REED: Enterprise is going to wonder why we haven't responded, right?
Maybe they'll be concerned and increase their speed.
TUCKER: Maybe, but if we really want to get them to go to high warp
we're going to have to attract their attention. Something a little more
dramatic than not answering their hails.
REED: Can they see us on their sensors?
TUCKER: Two days away at warp three? Oh, they can see us, maybe not too
clearly, but we should be a nice little blip on T'Pol's viewer.
REED: Then we've got to get that blip to tell them to pick up a little
steam. What if we fired our weapons?
TUCKER: They're nearly a quarter of a light year away. Our plasma
cannons have a range of less than ten kilometres. It would all still
look like a single blip. It's going to take a lot more than that.
REED: What if we jettison the impulse drive?
TUCKER: What good would that do?
REED: Well, you could rig a self-destruct. I imagine that would make
quite an explosion. Maybe even big enough to make that blip do
something odd.
TUCKER: No, I can't blow up our engine. We'd be adrift, dead in space.
REED: What's the difference between that and travelling at a snail's
pace?
TUCKER: I'm an engineer. I won't blow up our only engine.
REED: Then I'll ask you again. Ever hold your breath for eleven hours?
TUCKER: I think I have some micro-detonators in here somewhere.
(The engine module is jettisoned then exploded, creating a small
shockwave.)
REED: How does it feel to be slower than a snail?
TUCKER: I saw a great cartoon once. There were these two snails sitting
on the back of a big old turtle and one snail turns to the other and
says 'Hold on, Fred. Here we go'.
(Later again, as the pod spins gently in space, the two men are
shivering and shaking with cold.)
TUCKER: If I'm right, I get the rest of the bourbon.
REED: Fine. Less than twelve hours, you win. More than twelve and it's
mine. Go check the pressure gauge.
TUCKER: You check it. I don't think I can move my legs. (Reed rubs frost off the monitor.)
REED: I can't believe we've been
sitting here that long.
TUCKER: Come on, let's hear it. How much air's left?
REED: Ten hours.
TUCKER: That's probably the last bet I'll ever make, and I won. I
should feel like celebrating, shouldn't I?
REED: The whiskey's yours. Now, why don't you give us a toast before
you drink it? TUCKER: Ten hours for two men. If there were only one of
us he'd have twenty hours, wouldn't he?
REED: Great idea. Why don't you climb up into the airlock and seal
yourself in.
TUCKER: That's just what I was thinking.
REED: Any last words you want me to pass along?
TUCKER: Yeah. (Tucker is trying to get some feeling back into his legs.) TUCKER: Tell
Captain Archer that it was one hell of an honour serving with him.
(Tucker opens the inner airlock.)
REED: What are you doing?
TUCKER: We don't know whether or not they saw our little display of
pyrotechnics, but either way this'll double your chances. (Tucker climbs up.)
REED: You're crazy. Now get down from there!
TUCKER: Sit down, Lieutenant.
REED: If anyone should go up in there, it should be me. You're the
Chief Engineer.
TUCKER: I'm also in charge of deciding who's going into this airlock.
Do I make myself clear? (Reed points a phase pistol at Tucker.)
REED: Commander.
TUCKER: What are you going to do? Kill me?
REED: It's set to stun. I don't want to use it, but I will.
TUCKER: Put it down!
REED: Go to hell! (Tucker comes back down.)
TUCKER: Stop trying to be a hero. It doesn't suit
you.
REED: What would you know about being a hero? It takes nothing but a
coward to crawl up inside a hole to die.
TUCKER: Then go ahead and shoot me, but you better hope we don't make
it, because if we survive the first thing I'm going to do is bust your
ass back to Crewman Second Class for insubordination.
REED: Be my guest. I could use a little less responsibility. Now, get
down here.
TUCKER: Who the hell do you think you are?
REED: Your Armoury Officer, and perhaps your friend.
TUCKER: Friends don't shoot each other!
REED: You know, I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure you use up a lot
more oxygen when you shout like that!
TUCKER: So what are you saying? That you'd rather have Enterprise find
the two of us dead in here?
REED: That's exactly what I'm saying. If there's one chance in a
thousand that they saw our impulse drive explode, that they increased
their speed, I'll take that chance. I've invested far too much time
trying to figure you out, Mister Tucker. I'm not about to accept that
it was all for nothing.
 [Sickbay]
 REED: We're back. How did?
ARCHER: Easy, Malcolm. You fellows had a nice little bout with
hypothermia.
REED: The Commander.
ARCHER: He's going to be fine.
PHLOX: It took nearly three hours go get your body temperatures back to
normal.
REED: You must have seen the explosion.
ARCHER: Hard to miss. You know, you guys only had two or three hours of
air left.
REED: You don't say. We saw debris from Enterprise on one of the
asteroids. We assumed, we thought you were all.
ARCHER: I'll tell you all about it in the morning. Right now, the
Doctor needs to warm you up a few degrees. (Archer leaves.)
REED: Sub-Commander.
T'POL: Yes.
REED: Isn't there something you're supposed to say to me?
T'POL: About what?
REED: Heroics. Something about heroics.
T'POL: Good night, Lieutenant.
REED: Trip? (Tucker is out cold.) REED: Mind if I call you Trip? Sleep well, my
friend.

  [Ready
room]
 T'POL: This text book is what you wanted me to
see?
ARCHER: Not exactly. (He holds the book cover up by the side of his computer
screen.) ARCHER: Look familiar? This was my first astronomy book. My father got
it for me on my eighth birthday. I used to stare at the cover for
hours. The Arachnid Nebula. Who'd ever have thought I'd get to see it
in person. It's less than a light year away. We'll be there in a few
hours.
T'POL: (reading bookplate) From the library of Admiral Johnny Archer?
ARCHER: I had high hopes when I was a kid. (comm. chirps) Yes?
REED [OC]: Sir, there's a ship approaching at half impulse. They're
hailing us.
ARCHER: Do you know who it is?
REED [OC]: Hoshi says they're using a Vulcan frequency.
 [Bridge]
 (A small ship with curved nacelles is on the
viewscreen.)
ARCHER: Doesn't look like any Vulcan ship I've ever seen.
T'POL: This class of vessel hasn't been used for a long time.
HOSHI: They're hailing us again.
TAVIN [on viewscreen]: Is this the Earth vessel Enterprise?
ARCHER: It is. I'm Captain Jonathan Archer.
TAVIN [on viewscreen]: My name is Tavin, Captain of the Vahklas. It's
very good to meet you. (He's older, going grey, with a hint of a smile.)
ARCHER: I get the feeling you weren't sent out here by the High
Command.
TAVIN [on viewscreen]: Not quite. We're a civilian ship.
ARCHER: What brings you out this far?
TAVIN [on viewscreen]: I suppose you could say we're on a mission of
exploration.
ARCHER: From what I'm told, Vulcans aren't that interested in
exploring.
TAVIN [on viewscreen]: We're not typical Vulcans. I'd be happy to
explain, but first I'd like to ask a favour.
ARCHER: Certainly.
TAVIN [on viewscreen]: Our propulsion and life-support systems are in
need of repair. We'd be grateful for any assistance you could offer.
ARCHER: We'll see what we can do.
 [Captain's mess]
 (The two ships are docked together.)
TAVIN: We've noticed the High Command looking over our shoulders on
several occasions as well.
ARCHER: That's good to know. I was starting to think they'd singled us
out. Our chef's had a lot of experience lately preparing Vulcan dishes.
T'Pol says he's gotten pretty good at it. (Tavin points at Archer's plate.)
TAVIN: What is that?
ARCHER: Oh, it's called chicken.
TAVIN: May I? (T'Pol glares then passes his plate.)
ARCHER: Of course. It's, er, meat, you know.
TAVIN: It looks delicious.
ARCHER: So, when did you leave Vulcan?
TAVIN: Eight years ago.
TOLARIS: (a younger man) And in those eight years we've experienced
more than most Vulcans will in their lifetime.
ARCHER: You said you were explorers?
TAVIN: Yes, but it's not space we're exploring. It's ourselves.
(He samples the chicken, and beams.) TAVIN: Mmm!
T'POL: You're V'tosh ka'tur.
ARCHER: I'm sorry?
TAVIN: Vulcans without logic. It's a name the Elders give to anyone who
disagrees with the ancestral teachings, but it's not entirely accurate.
We haven't abandoned logic. We've simply learned to exist without the
need to continually repress our emotions. It's taken years of
experimentation, but we've managed to find a balance between the two.
T'POL: That's not possible.
TOLARIS: Here we are.
TAVIN: Logic is an essential part of Vulcan existence, but it has to
complement emotions, not exclude them.
TOLARIS: You must know a great deal about emotion. You live on a human
starship. That's not something that many Vulcans would be comfortable
with.
T'POL: I am here as an observer.
TOLARIS: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
T'POL: I'm not capable of feeling offence.
ARCHER: My Chief Engineer tells me your repairs are going to take three
or four days. We were going to use that time to explore the nebula, if
you don't mind tagging along.
TAVIN: Not at all.
 [Engineering}
(Tucker looks at his monitor.)  TUCKER: I've never seen
an engine this far gone. We're going to have to swap out every plasma
relay in your reactor.
KOV: (young, brown-haired, a little tubby) There are a lot of women on
your ship.
TUCKER: Yeah, nearly a third of the crew.
KOV: Is it true you mate year-round, with any of them you choose?
TUCKER: You haven't been around humans too much, have you?
KOV: You're the first we've met, but I've heard a lot of stories. Your
people indulge their passions. Do you really eat six meals a day?
TUCKER: More like three.
KOV: And what about sleep? I understand you spend more than half the
day in bed.
TUCKER: Eight hours. We sleep for eight hours. In my case, about six.
When we're through here maybe we can get a bite to eat. I might be able
to clear up some of your misconceptions.
KOV: I'd like that, Commander.
TUCKER: Call me Trip.
 [Ready room]
 T'POL: They've asked for any medical supplies we
can spare and a thousand litres of plasma coolant.
ARCHER: Well, that shouldn't be a problem.
T'POL: Tavin has also requested the recipe for Chicken Marsala.
ARCHER: Tell him Chef's recipes are usually classified but, we'll make
an exception in this case. I thought you'd be spending a little more
time getting to know our guests.
T'POL: I've been busy.
ARCHER: It seems to me like, you've been busy avoiding them. I can
understand that you might not approve of what they're trying to do, but
for all we know they're onto something.
T'POL: That's unlikely.
ARCHER: Is it? Eight years. That's a pretty good track record.
T'POL: Just because they smile and eat chicken doesn't mean they've
learned to master their emotions.
ARCHER: Maybe I'm just relieved to finally meet some Vulcans who aren't
giving me a hard time. Then again, if they have found this balance.
T'POL: They're not the first ones to attempt this, Captain. Others have
tried to reintegrate their emotions. They all failed. What they're
doing is dangerous.
ARCHER: Unless my instincts are way off, they don't seem very dangerous
to me. But I could be wrong. I can't order you to spend time with them,
but I would encourage you to keep an open mind.
 [Mess hall]
 (It is empty, save for T'Pol getting a hot drink
whilst reading a PADD.)
TOLARIS: So this is the mess hall.
T'POL: It is.
TOLARIS: The crew must not have much of an appetite.
T'POL: Most of them are asleep. It's quite late.
TOLARIS: Could you show me how to operate this? (The drinks dispenser.)
T'POL: What would you like?
TOLARIS: I'm not sure. I don't have much experience with human food.
What's that?
T'POL: Mint tea.
TOLARIS: That'll be fine. (She takes a mug from the cupboard, puts it into the dispenser,
presses a button and says -)
T'POL:  Mint tea, hot. (Liquid pours into the mug
and she hands it to him.)
TOLARIS: Thank you. It has a lot of flavour.
T'POL: You can try something else.
TOLARIS: No, it's fine. I'm just surprised. Do you like the taste?
T'POL: Their selection of Vulcan beverages is limited.
TOLARIS: But it can make Vulcan tea.
T'POL: Yes.
TOLARIS: Interesting.
T'POL: Unless you need further assistance (T'Pol starts to leave.)
TOLARIS: How long have you lived among humans?
T'POL: I spent two years at the Vulcan consulate on Earth and seven
months on Enterprise.
TOLARIS: That's a long time away from home. Living here has obviously
affected you in ways that you don't realise.
T'POL: You may be right. On occasion, I also drink chamomile tea.
TOLARIS: And you have a sense of humour. A concept that most Vulcans
can't seem to grasp.
T'POL: You're easily amused.
TOLARIS: There's that humour again. I'm curious, why do you stay here?
T'POL: Captain Archer needs a Science Officer.
TOLARIS: Is that the only reason? Maybe you're more attached to these
people than you'd care to admit.
T'POL: What makes you say that?
TOLARIS: Your emotions are much closer to the surface than other
Vulcans. They're easier to read.
T'POL: I have yet to mediate this evening. Perhaps that's what you're
sensing.
TOLARIS: This may surprise you, but we still meditate. The balance
between emotion and logic requires constant discipline.
T'POL: So you've said. You and your colleagues have chosen a reckless
path.
TOLARIS: Have we?
T'POL: History's shown that Vulcans who attempt to embrace their
emotions often revert to their primal nature.
TOLARIS: That's a myth. Propaganda from five thousand years ago. Our
primal nature, T'Pol, is not as dangerous as you think. Commander
Tucker suggests that I try something called pizza. Would you care to
join me?
T'POL: I've already eaten. Another time, perhaps.
 [Bridge]
 REED: Is it what you imagined, sir?
ARCHER: Pictures don't do it justice.
TRAVIS: It's big. Over eight billion kilometres in diameter.
ARCHER: Eight billion? Are you sure?
TRAVIS: According to sensors.
ARCHER: My astronomy book said it was only six and a half.
HOSHI: We'll have to send our readings to the publisher so they can put
out a revised edition.
ARCHER: How long would it take to chart that thing?
T'POL: Several weeks.
TAVIN: My vessel is equipped with translinear sensors. We could help
you complete the survey a good deal quicker.
ARCHER: We should have someone on your ship to monitor the data. (to
T'Pol) Would you mind working from there?
T'POL: No.
ARCHER: (to Tavin) Glad you dropped by. Take us in, Travis.
(Enterprise enters the blue haze of the Arachnid nebula.)
 [Vahklas sensor control]
(The nebula is on the main monitor.)
 TOLARIS: Look at that. I've never seen anything so beautiful. You'd probably
consider that an emotional reaction.
T'POL: Not necessarily. It is aesthetically pleasing.
TOLARIS: Pleasing. Coming from you, that's practically an outburst. (T'Pol spots a statue in an alcove.)
T'POL: It's curious that people who
reject Surak's teachings would display his likeness.
TOLARIS: We don't reject his teachings. We simply disagree with how
they're interpreted. Have you read his original text? He never intended
for us to purge our emotions. He wanted us to master them, and then
carefully integrate them into our lives.
T'POL: I doubt many would agree with you.
TOLARIS: That doesn't mean we're wrong.
T'POL: What did you do on Vulcan before you left?
TOLARIS: I taught literature at the Shirkar Academy.
T'POL: You gave up a great deal to wander the galaxy in a transport.
TOLARIS: I don't have any regrets. I always knew there had to be more
to life than just logic and reason. Haven't you ever felt that way?
T'POL: Not recently.
TOLARIS: But you did once?
T'POL: Once. I should take these readings back to Enterprise.
TOLARIS: T'Pol, you said that you meditated each night. Tonight, don't.
See what happens. I think you'll find your dreams will be far more
interesting. You're a scientist. Consider it an experiment.
 [Mess hall]
 TUCKER: Where'd you hear that?
KOV: A Vulcan anthropologist told me he'd seen the ritual during an
Earth expedition.
TUCKER:: They're not trying to kill the quarterback. They're just
trying to keep him from throwing the ball or running with it. It's only
a game, not a fight to the death.
KOV: I see.
TUCKER: You must think we're a bunch of barbarians.
KOV: Your species does have a reputation, but I've always suspected the
stories were exaggerated.
TUCKER: Well, I hope you'll tell all your friends. Set the record
straight.
KOV: Gladly.
TUCKER: There's, er, something I've always wondered about Vulcans.
Maybe you could clear it up for me.
KOV: Please.
TUCKER: It's kind of personal.
KOV: Go ahead.
TUCKER: Well, I've learned about your marriage customs. How your
parents arrange the whole thing when you're young, stuff like that but,
what about, you know.
KOV: Ah, you mean sex. (Heads turn.)
TUCKER: It's not a topic I've heard Vulcans discuss.
KOV: Well, we do have it, if that's what you're asking.
REED: Am I interrupting anything?
KOV: No, please join us, Mister?
REED: Reed. Malcolm Reed.
KOV: Kov. We were just discussing Vulcan mating rituals. Most of my
people are extremely uncomfortable talking about such things. So many
inhibitions. Vulcan males are driven to mate once every seven years.
TUCKER: Seven years?
REED: Frightening.
KOV: Over the past few years, we've been developing methods to
accelerate the mating cycle.
TUCKER: You up for seconds?
KOV: I've had enough, thank you. Back to work? A pleasure meeting you,
Mister Reed.
REED: Likewise.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: Sir, I'm picking up a transmission from
Echo three. (Archer signs a PADD and hands it back to the red-haired woman - a
yeoman?)
ARCHER: Starfleet?
HOSHI: It's Admiral Forrest.
ARCHER: I'll take it in my ready room.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Admiral Forrest. Good to see you.
FORREST [on monitor]: You, too, Jon. I understand you have guests.
ARCHER: A Vulcan crew. How'd you know?
FORREST [on monitor]: I got a call from Ambassador Soval about an hour
ago. They're aware that you've docked with the Vahklas, and they have a
favour to ask.
ARCHER: A favour from me?  
FORREST [on monitor]: A minister at the High Command has a son on that
ship, an engineer named Kov. Have you met him?
ARCHER: I don't think so.
FORREST [on monitor]: Well, apparently, the two of them had a falling
out about nine, ten years ago. His father's tried to contact him
several times since then, but Kov won't respond.
ARCHER: What do they want me to do?
FORREST [on monitor]: I hear these aren't your garden variety Vulcans.
Can I assume you're on friendly terms?
ARCHER: Yes.
FORREST [on monitor]: Kov's father is dying, Jon. He'd like to speak
with his son. Maybe you can encourage him somehow.
ARCHER: I'll see what I can do.
FORREST [on monitor]: The High Command let you keep your Science
Officer. It wouldn't hurt to return the favour.
ARCHER: Understood.
FORREST [on monitor]: Keep me posted.
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 (She blows out the candle and dreams.)
TOLARIS [OC]: Our primal nature isn't as dangerous as you think.
(She is exploring San Francisco with Tolaris whispering in her ear.)
TOLARIS: Do you like the taste? You must have
learned a great deal about emotion.
(She enters the jazz club, then opens her eyes to see Tolaris sleeping
next to her.)
TOLARIS: Why do you stay here?
(The jazz club, the nebula, making love with Tolaris, the statue of
Surak falls from it's alcove and shatters. She wakes with a start.)
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: This is more than a simple headache. Your
blood pressure's elevated and I'm reading unusually high synaptic
activity. It doesn't appear to be a virus or a bacterial infection. I'd
like to run a cranial scan, just to be safe.
T'POL: That won't be necessary.
PHLOX: It'll only take a moment.
T'POL: I believe I can explain my symptoms. Last night I neglected to
meditate before I went to sleep. As a result, I awoke feeling agitated.
All I need is an injection of inaprovaline. Twenty five milligrams
should suffice.
PHLOX: Very well, Doctor. It's not like you to stray from your routine.
This wouldn't have anything to do with our visitors? You've been
spending quite a bit of time on their ship.
T'POL: I've become acquainted with one of them. He suggested that my
dreams might be more interesting if I didn't meditate.
PHLOX: And?
T'POL: He was wrong. They were unsettling. It was a foolish thing to
do.
PHLOX: Nothing that a little inaprovaline can't cure. I can understand
why you'd be intrigued by their philosophy. Maybe you shouldn't be so
quick to dismiss it after one bad experience.
T'POL: There are too many risks. It would be unwise to continue.
PHLOX: You're probably right, but if you do decide to experiment
further, keep in mind that they've been working at this for a number of
years. You've only known them for two days. Go slowly.
T'POL: Thank you, Doctor.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in.
KOV: Captain.
ARCHER: Please have a seat.
KOV: The repairs to our propulsion system are going well. Mister
Tucker's been very helpful.
ARCHER: That's good to hear.
KOV: Is there a problem?
ARCHER: I called you here to pass along a message from your father.
KOV: You spoke with him?
ARCHER: Actually, it came through a Vulcan ambassador. I'm sorry to be
the one to tell you this, but your father is very ill. He wants you to
contact him as soon as possible. If you'd like, my comm. officer can
arrange the transmission.
KOV: It's a kind offer, but I'll deal with this myself. Thanks for the
message. Kov stands to leave.)
ARCHER: I know it's none of my business, but do you plan on contacting
him?
KOV: The last time I spoke with my father, he said I'd brought shame to
fifteen generations of our family.
ARCHER: He's dying, Kov.
KOV: If it isn't too much trouble, would you please send a message back
for me? Tell him that we said goodbye a long time ago.
 [Vahklas]
(Tolaris enters bearing two mugs.) TOLARIS: Good morning.
Chamomile?
T'POL: Thank you.
TOLARIS: How did it go?
T'POL: The lateral sensors were out of alignment. I haven't had a
chance to scan the disodium layer.
TOLARIS: I mean last night. Did you take my advice?
T'POL: Yes.
TOLARIS: And your dreams?
T'POL: I'd rather not discuss them.
TOLARIS: It will get easier. Tonight will be less disturbing. (He walks
towards her.)
T'POL: (backing away) I plan to resume meditating tonight.
TOLARIS: You can't give up after one trial.
T'POL: It was a mistake to try in the first place.
TOLARIS: Wasn't there anything enjoyable about the experience?
T'POL: I'm reading over twenty million cubic metres of disodium as well
as traces of ethylchlorate.
TOLARIS: We can run the scans later. Tell me about your dreams. Your
emotions were closer to the surface. It must have been intense.
T'POL: It involved a memory. I was walking down a street in San
Francisco on Earth.
TOLARIS: Why did you leave the compound?
T'POL: I was curious about human recreation. I wanted to see it for
myself.
TOLARIS: So you broke protocol?
T'POL: It was late. Everyone in the compound had gone to sleep. I
didn't see any harm in leaving for a couple of hours.
TOLARIS: Where did you go?
T'POL: I simply walked. Then I heard music.
TOLARIS: Music?
T'POL: It was unusual, chaotic, but I was drawn to it.
TOLARIS: Go on.
T'POL: I went into a restaurant where musicians were playing. I sat at
a table.
TOLARIS: How did you feel?
T'POL: I can't remember.
TOLARIS: Try.
T'POL: I felt invigorated.
TOLARIS: Emotion. You felt emotion.
T'POL: Briefly. They finished playing and I returned to the compound.
TOLARIS: You could feel that way again, T'Pol. It isn't difficult, and
it's nothing to be afraid of. I can show you how.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: You want me to talk to him?
ARCHER: From what I hear you've become fast friends. Maybe you'll have
better luck than I did.
TUCKER: Well, I'll try, but something tells me it won't be as simple as
fixing an engine. He's got a lot of resentment.
ARCHER: Do your best.
TUCKER: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: What about this Tolaris fellow?
TUCKER: Well, I haven't really gotten to know him. He seems kind of
quiet, though. A little sullen.
ARCHER: T'Pol's been spending a lot of time with him lately.
TUCKER: Is that a problem?
ARCHER: Two days ago she couldn't wait to get these people off the
ship. I practically had to order her to work with him. Now, they're
almost inseparable.
TUCKER: If I didn't know better I'd say you were a little jealous. If I
was the only human on a ship full of Vulcans and we ran into an Earth
vessel, I'd be spending as much time with them as I could. She likes
being around her own kind. Who doesn't?
ARCHER: Well, let me know how it goes with Kov.
TUCKER: Yes, sir.
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 (The pair are sitting on the floor facing each
other. Candles are lit.)
T'POL: Mind meld?
TOLARIS: It's an ancient technique. It was abandoned centuries ago, but
we've discovered that it can help us access our emotions.
T'POL: How does it work?
TOLARIS: I'd begin by creating a telepathic link. We would be able to
share our memories, our thoughts. In essence, we would become one mind.
It's quite an experience, but it is profoundly intimate. Are you
prepared for that? If you'd like, we could try a more traditional form
of guided meditation but it wouldn't be nearly as effective.
T'POL: Proceed.
TOLARIS: (he puts fingers of his right hand on her face along the cheek
bone and jaw) It's all right. Close your eyes. Try to focus on my
voice. My mind to your mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts. Our minds
are merging, our minds are becoming one.
T'POL: It's not working.
TOLARIS: You're resisting. Relax. My mind to your mind. Your thoughts
to my thoughts. Our minds are merging, our minds are becoming one. (She
takes a sharp intake of breath) TOLARIS: (telepathically) Am I with you?
T'POL: (telepathically) Yes.
TOLARIS: (telepathically) Can you sense my thoughts?
T'POL: (telepathically) Yes.
TOLARIS: You're doing well. I want you to think about that night when
you left the compound. Imagine yourself walking down that street. (She
does, and we see it.) TOLARIS: Good. Now listen. Can you hear the music? Listen.
Now follow it. I can see why you were drawn to this place. It's unlike
anything on Vulcan. I'm not surprised
 [Jazz restaurant - memory]
 (Slightly fuzzy optics. He's sitting at the table
talking to her.)
TOLARIS: it triggered an emotional response. You said you were
invigorated, what else?
T'POL: I don't know.
TOLARIS: Yes, you do. You're just not used to describing your emotions.
You experienced other things. Excitement about breaking protocol,
apprehension about getting caught, and the music, the music made you
feel elated. Allow yourself to feel these emotions again. Don't hold
them back.
T'POL: I have to return to the compound.
TOLARIS: You're anxious. It's just another emotion.
T'POL: Let me go.
TOLARIS: Stay with me, T'Pol.
T'POL: No!
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 T'POL: Stop.
TOLARIS: No. (T'Pol finally manages to break the link.)
T'POL: Stop! This was a mistake.
TOLARIS: You've made progress. Don't give up now.
T'POL: Please go.
TOLARIS: T'Pol.
T'POL: Leave! TOLARIS: You're feeling anger. Your emotions are breaking the
surface. Embrace them! (leaving) What a shame.
(After the door closes T'Pol falls to the floor, then crawls to a comm.
panel.)
T'POL: T'Pol to Sickbay.
 [Engineering]
 KOV: I've already been through this with your
Captain.
TUCKER: Are you sure you're making the right decision?
KOV: If you knew my father, you'd understand.
TUCKER: I don't mean to put too fine a point on this, but you've got a
limited window of opportunity. Once it closes
KOV: I consider you a friend, Trip, and I appreciate what you're trying
to do, but please don't. I have no intention of contacting him. I
test-fired our port thruster last night. It's still off by twelve
percent.
TUCKER: Well, probably a faulty injector. Should be easy enough to fix.
Do Vulcans dance? You know (He moves his arms.)
KOV: No. Only when it's part of some tedious ceremony.
TUCKER: I remember the first dance I ever went to. Bayshore Elementary
Panama City, Florida. A girl I had a crush on, Melissa Lyles, was going
to be there. So I spent weeks practicing the two-step with my brother.
I wanted to make sure I was ready. She was wearing a red dress that
night. Prettiest girl there. All I wanted to do was ask her to dance
with me, but I never worked up the courage to go over and talk to her.
I caught her looking at me a couple times but, I ended up just standing
in a corner with my buddies.
KOV: Interesting, but what does that have to do with our thruster
problem?
TUCKER: It's been more than twenty years and I'm still kicking myself
for not asking that girl to dance. You probably don't know this, but
regret is one of the strongest emotions and one of the saddest. I have
a feeling you haven't had a brush with it yet, but it sounds to me like
you're pretty close. That's something you might want to avoid.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in.
TOLARIS: Good morning.
ARCHER: Morning. Can I get you something? Coffee?
TOLARIS: No, thanks.
ARCHER: Have a seat. Trip tells me the repairs to your ship are almost
finished. You should be on your way pretty soon.
TOLARIS: Yes.
ARCHER: How's that survey coming along?
TOLARIS: We'll be done this afternoon.
ARCHER: That's great news. I wanted to thank you for all of your help.
TOLARIS: It was the least we could do. Besides, we've enjoyed spending
our time here. You have an exceptional crew, Captain.
ARCHER: Starfleet's finest. Sleep well last night?
TOLARIS: Well enough. You?
ARCHER: Tossed and turned. Always happens whenever we're exploring
someplace new.
TOLARIS: I understand. Well, if there's nothing more, Captain, I'm
eager to get back to work. We have another twenty million cubic
kilometres to chart.
ARCHER: Sorry to keep you. I'm afraid you'll be working alone today.
TOLARIS: Oh?
ARCHER: Sub-Commander T'Pol's in Sickbay. From what the doctor tells
me, she's in pretty bad shape.
TOLARIS: That's unfortunate. What happened?
ARCHER: You know damn well what happened. She told me about your, what
did she call it, mind-meld? She said when she asked you to stop, you
got angry. She said she had to force you away.
TOLARIS: What happened between us is personal. It's not your concern.
ARCHER: You assaulted a member of my crew.
TOLARIS: I did no such thing. Mind-melds can be emotionally turbulent.
She simply panicked.
ARCHER: Panic doesn't land you in Sickbay. Our doctor said she could
have suffered neurological damage, thanks to you.
TOLARIS: No one forced her to try the meld. She did it willingly.
ARCHER: You've been manipulating her ever since you came aboard.
TOLARIS: I am helping her shed a lifetime of repression, and you of all
people should understand what I'm trying to do. You're human. I need to
go see her.
ARCHER: T'Pol's had enough of your help. Stay away from her.
TOLARIS: She is in a crucial stage of her awakening. She needs
guidance.
ARCHER: I told you, it's over.
TOLARIS: I think that's for her to decide.
ARCHER: Maybe I'm not making myself clear. Sickbay's off-limits.
TOLARIS: You're in my way, Captain. You'd be wise to let me leave.
ARCHER: What's wrong, Tolaris? Getting angry? I thought you had that
under control.
TOLARIS: (grabbing Archer) Move aside.
ARCHER: T'Pol's right. You've got a temper.
TOLARIS: Now!
ARCHER: Go to hell. (Tolaris pushes him away, against the wall, then
lifts him off his feet against the ceiling and throws him over the
desk. Archer removes a phase pistol from the back of his chair.)
TOLARIS: You planned this.
ARCHER: If I'd known I was going to get thrown across the room that
hard, I might have tried a different approach. I think it's time you
and your friends went on your merry way.
 [Corridor]
 TUCKER: Keep an eye on the intermix pressure.
Don't let it drift above five thousand.
KOV: Five thousand.
TUCKER: And watch those injector ports.
KOV: I will. (at airlock) I thought you'd like to know, I got an update
on my father. Apparently, his condition's improved.
TUCKER: Is that so?
KOV: The surgeons implanted a vaso-stimulator. They say, with any luck
it'll extend his life a few years.
TUCKER: I'm glad to hear it. That'll give you a little more time to
think about making that call.
KOV: I already did. My father's the one who gave me the good news.
Thank you, Trip.
TUCKER: Anytime.
(The Vahklas undocks and flies away.)
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 (She's sitting cross-legged with a single candle
lit.)
T'POL: Come in.
ARCHER: Is this a bad time?
T'POL: Not at all.
ARCHER: Feeling any better?
T'POL: Has the Vulcan ship left?
ARCHER: About twenty minutes ago.
T'POL: Then yes, I'm feeling better.
ARCHER: You do this every night?
T'POL: Every night.
ARCHER: I think I finally understand why. I'll see you in the morning.
T'POL; Captain. Do you dream?
ARCHER: Sure. Sometimes they're even in colour.
T'POL: Is it enjoyable?
ARCHER: Most nights.
T'POL: I envy you. Goodnight.

  [Bridge]
 ARCHER: We couldn't do this in my ready room?
(Tucker has a camera.)
TUCKER: Nah, the Captain's got to be in the Captain's chair. Tilt your
chin up.
ARCHER: Just take the picture.
TUCKER: You've got a stanchion growing out of your head. Swivel to the
right about ten degrees. Every recruit walking into Starfleet Command
is going to see this on the wall.
TRAVIS: It's a real honour, sir. Seeing those Starfleet captains every
day gave us something to aspire to.
TUCKER: There's a reflection from that status display. (to T'Pol) Could
you kill the monitors in the Situation Room? Come on, T'Pol. The artist
in Oakland needs a good picture to paint from.
ARCHER: Do Vulcan captains have their portraits hanging at the High
Command?
T'POL: Vulcans are revered for their accomplishments, not for the way
they look.
TUCKER: Except for the really important ones, who get mummified.
(Archer gets up and walks.)
ARCHER: Why can't they just use a photo from my file?
REED: Sir, I'm picking up a small planet on our current heading.
ARCHER: I thought there weren't any systems along this course.
REED: It's not a system, Captain. It's just a planet.
ARCHER: Put it up.
(A black disc against the stars.)
ARCHER: Magnify.
T'POL: It's a rogue. A planet that's broken out of its orbit.
ARCHER: Lay in a course. Let's take a closer look.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
(Tucker takes the photo.)
TUCKER: Captain Archer in command.
ARCHER: Give it a rest, Trip.
T'POL: This planet supports a diverse animal population.
HOSHI: How is that possible?
TRAVIS: Shouldn't the surface be frozen solid?
T'POL: Hot gas is vented from the planet's interior. Most of the life
forms are concentrated in those areas.
ARCHER: Oases. Any people?
T'POL: No evidence of humanoid life.
REED: I'm picking up a power signature near the equator. There's a ship
down there.
ARCHER: Try to hail them.
HOSHI: No response.
TUCKER: Maybe they want to be left alone. A single ship on a dark
planet? Maybe they're on their honeymoon.
 [Shuttlepod]
 REED: Infrared's useless. There's too much heat
coming from those thermal vents.
(Turbulence. Archer is in the
pilot's seat.)
ARCHER: We should be right over that ship.
T'POL: I'm scanning for a break in the canopy.
HOSHI: If this is anything like the Amazon, good luck.
ARCHER: I used to say I could land a shuttlepod with my eyes closed.
REED: Well, the proof's in the pudding, Captain.
T'POL: There's a clearing ahead, nine hundred metres, but it's not much
bigger than the shuttlepod.
ARCHER: It doesn't have to be.
 [Jungle]
 (Despite being in permanent darkness, the tropical
large leaved foliage is shown green in the torchlight.)
T'POL: Captain, the vessel is that way, six hundred metres.
REED: Follow me.
ARCHER: Why don't you let me play Captain for a while, Malcolm? This
reminds me of the rain forest in New Zealand. I earned my wilderness
merit badge there.
REED: You were a Boy Scout, sir?
ARCHER: I was an Eagle Scout.
REED: Oh, so was I.
ARCHER: Really? How many merit badges?
REED: Twenty eight. You?
ARCHER: Twenty six.
REED: Oh, that's not bad, sir.
T'POL: Captain.
(They draw phase pistols and switch on the night vision monocles, to
see a multi-legged creature crawling up a tree.)
ARCHER: We spot any more creatures like that and we'll earn our
Exobiology badges.
REED: Actually, I already have that one.
 [Campsite]
 (Complete with tents and a fire.)
HOSHI: A campsite, sir.
ARCHER: Anyone home? We're from the Starship Enterprise. Is there
anyone here?
T'POL: I'm still not detecting any biosigns, but their ship's less than
two hundred metres in that direction.
ARCHER: You and Malcolm check it out. We'll stay here in case anyone
shows up.
 [Jungle]
 (As they move through the jungle, we get the idea
they are being watched.)
REED: Did you hear that?
T'POL: Yes.
REED: Anything?
T'POL: For a moment, I had a humanoid biosign. It's gone.
(Again we see them through another's eyes.)
REED: It's not gone.
(They are jumped by two people wearing red goggles and camouflage-style
overalls.)
BURZAAN: (fair haired) Dhk'tr! Siskah tral p'kat.
(He adjusts his goggles then raises them, lowering his weapon.)
BURZAAN: Nahk I'taree.
 [Campsite]
 (The fire is blazing.)
REED: Captain, are you all right?
ARCHER: Everything's fine. These are the Eska.
(By the firelight we see the aliens have high ridged noses extending
into their foreheads.)
DAMRUS: (stocky, deep voiced) My name is Damrus.
ARCHER: This is T'Pol, my science officer, and Lieutenant Malcolm Reed.
REED: Pleased to meet you. Your friends nearly shot me back there.
SHIRAHT: We're sorry. There are dangerous animals in the forest.
DAMRUS: We've never seen other humanoids here before.
T'POL: Have we trespassed in your territory?
DAMRUS: This planet is no one's territory, but it's a special place for
us.
BURZAAN: What are you doing on Dakala?
ARCHER: We're just here to explore. We'd like to stay for a while, if
that's all right. It's a big planet. We could find another landing
site, but I was hoping you might enjoy the company.
(Later, sharing a meal)
ARCHER: You aren't exactly roughing it.
DAMRUS: Drayjin meat is one of life's great pleasure.
REED: Mmm. No argument here. I'm curious why our sensors didn't detect
you.
DAMRUS: We use sensing cloaks. They keep the wildlife from spotting us.
HOSHI: Are you studying wildlife here?
BURZAAN: Not exactly.
DAMRUS: We're on an expedition.
BURZAAN: That drayjin you're eating, we killed it yesterday.
T'POL: You're hunters.
DAMRUS: Our people have been coming here for nine generations.
T'POL: To kill the indigenous species?
DAMRUS: Taking wild animals is part of our tradition. There are higher
primates here. We don't touch them.
ARCHER: Hunting went out of style on Earth over a hundred years ago.
That doesn't mean we don't appreciate your hospitality.
REED: That gear you carry seems pretty elaborate to take down a few
game animals.
BURZAAN: Don't underestimate the game on this planet. They often get
the better of us.
REED: I wonder if I might join one of your hunts.
DAMRUS: I thought you people didn't approve.
REED: You were able to sneak up on us without being detected by our
night-vision sensors. I'd like to see how you did that. I promise I
won't kill anything, sir.
ARCHER: It's up to our hosts.
(Damrus raises his mug to say yes.)
 Captain's starlog, supplemental. Trip and Malcolm
are bringing Hoshi back to Enterprise and putting together some camping
gear to bring back to the surface.
 [Launch bay]
 TUCKER: If the bugs glow in the dark, at least you
can tell when they've crawled into your sleeping bag.
HOSHI: One more reason I am happy to spend the night in my own bunk.
Anyway, it's the things you can't see that I'd be worried about.
REED: Like those bore worms.
TUCKER: Bore worms?
HOSHI: Apparently they crawl into your ear to lay their eggs. Have a
nice night.
 [Campsite]
 T'POL: We can start with the entomologists then
bring the other bioscience teams down. I'd recommend we limit the
number of crewmen on the surface to six at a time.
ARCHER: Sensible.
DAMRUS: Enjoying yourselves?
ARCHER: Very much. Thanks for sharing your camp with us.
DAMRUS: We're heading out in six hours. I suggest you get some sleep,
if you're still planning to come along.
REED: I wouldn't miss it.
DAMRUS: Good night.
(He leaves the group.)
ARCHER: Good night.
REED: Night. I suppose I'll turn in then.
TUCKER: Sounds like a good idea.
(T'Pol leaves too.)
ARCHER: I think I'll sit up for a while.
TUCKER: Have fun.
ARCHER: Yeah.
(Later, he's just about asleep, lying against a fallen tree.)
WOMAN [OC]: Jonathan. Jonathan.
ARCHER: Hello?
(Archer gets up to investigate.)
ARCHER: Is someone there?
WOMAN [OC]: Jonathan.
(Archer turns on a light and goes into the jungle to search.)
ARCHER: Who's there?
(He sees a blonde woman in a long blue dress, then she runs
away.  Later, everyone's awake and Damrus is fingering a
wicked looking blade.)
TUCKER: If the Captain says he saw her, he saw her.
ARCHER: Are there any others in your hunting party?
BURZAAN: No.
DAMRUS: Certainly no human females. You sure she wasn't from your
vessel?
ARCHER: I'm sure. (comm. beep) Archer.
TRAVIS [OC]: Mayweather here, Captain. There are no other ships, on the
surface or in orbit.
ARCHER: Thanks, Travis. Archer out.
(Shiraht returns from the jungle with T'Pol and Reed.)
SHIRAHT: Nothing.
ARCHER: She was young, long blonde hair. She was wearing some kind of a
nightgown.
REED: A nightgown, sir?
T'POL: Perhaps you were dreaming.
ARCHER: It wasn't a dream. She said my name. She knew who I was and, I
think I knew her.
TUCKER: Sir?
ARCHER: There was something about her. I, I've seen her before.
DAMRUS: On this planet, it's always night. You're surrounded by things
you can hear, but not see. It can stimulate the imagination.
BURZAAN: You wouldn't be the first person who looked into the jungle
and saw something that wasn't there.
ARCHER: She was real.
DAMRUS: Captain Archer, what are the chances you'd encounter a
half-naked woman who you think you know dozens of light years from your
homeworld? Go to sleep. If you're lucky, maybe she'll visit you in your
dreams.
(The hunting party is now getting ready to set out. Reed examines
one of the goggles.)
REED: These can detect infrared.
(Damrus takes them off him.)
DAMRUS: Among other things.
TUCKER: What are you going after today?
BURZAAN: We saw a pack of fire wolves yesterday about six kilometres
from here. It's a difficult hike.
REED: I'll try to keep up.
DAMRUS: We'd appreciate it. We only have two days left.
ARCHER: What's the hurry?
DAMRUS: To preserve Dakala, our law states that we're allowed to hunt
here for four days each year. Then we have to leave.
SHIRAHT: Hunters often wait decades for a chance to come here.
(T'Pol points to the map.)
T'POL: Are those volcanic vents?
DAMRUS: Yes. That area's particularly active. Mineral springs, steam
vents. It's quite spectacular.
ARCHER: Could be worth checking out while Malcolm's on his safari.
TUCKER: I'll get my camera.
DAMRUS: Did you sleep well, Captain?
ARCHER: Yes, fine.
DAMRUS: Good. If you see any beautiful females today you'll be sure to
let us know.
 [Jungle]
 (Out hunting, the group spot a hairy four-legged
animal.)
DAMRUS: Drayjin. A female. They're very unpredictable.
 [Thermal vents]
 ARCHER: Reminds me of Yellowstone.
T'POL: It's more like the grottoes of Deneva Prime. I'm detecting a
large geothermal shaft sixty metres in that direction. I'd like to
examine it. Sir?
ARCHER: Permission granted. Stay in contact.
(He turns off his night monocle as she leaves.)
TUCKER: So, she was wearing a nightgown? You think she's real.
ARCHER: I wasn't hallucinating.
TUCKER: Captain, it doesn't make any sense.
ARCHER: I know. Trip, have you ever known me to do anything foolish? I
mean, really foolish?
TUCKER: I remember a poker game at Jupiter Station once. Other than
that.
ARCHER: Last night I walked into an alien jungle, alone, chasing a
woman who couldn't possibly have been there.
TUCKER: That might qualify.
ARCHER: It was like I was being drawn to her. Like I didn't have any
control over what I was doing. I can't explain it.
TUCKER: She must have been some woman.
 [Jungle]
 (The hunters see the drayjin again, then over to
the side, a rock turns into a giant slug and moves off.)
DAMRUS: Wraith!
REED: What is it? Is there something out there?
BURZAAN: It could be a plume of steam. They can fool our thermal
scanners.
REED: Well, let's find out.
DAMRUS: No point in all of us chasing a sensor ghost. You two stay on
the trail.
SHIRAHT: Damrus.
DAMRUS: Take care of our guest. We'll catch up.
 [Thermal vents]
 (Tucker is taking photographs of the vents when
Archer sees her again, nearby. He goes to investigate, she runs, he
follows to a small clearing.)
WOMAN: Jonathan.
ARCHER: Who are you?
(Archer gets out his communicator and switches on the UT.)
ARCHER: How do you know my name?
WOMAN: I need you, Jonathan.
ARCHER: You're speaking English.
WOMAN: I need you to understand.
ARCHER: I know you. How is that possible?
WOMAN: If you didn't know me, would you have come?
ARCHER: You said you needed me. Why?
WOMAN: You're different.
ARCHER: Different?
(She seems to hear something that bothers her.)
ARCHER: What is it?
(The hunters fire at something.)
ARCHER: What's wrong?
WOMAN: Harm.
ARCHER: I don't want to harm you.
WOMAN: Not Jonathan.
ARCHER: Then who? Who wants to harm you?
TUCKER: Captain?
(Archer turns and gets a flashlight shone in his face. When he looks
back she has gone.)
T'POL: Are you all right?
ARCHER: Fine.
TUCKER: You disappeared on us. What are you doing out here?
ARCHER: Just taking some scans.
(Two Eska are pursing their prey when one is attacked by the giant
slug.)
 [Campsite]
 (Burzaan is on a stretcher, screaming in pain.)
DAMRUS: Hold him.
SHIRAHT: I'm trying. If you can't keep him steady.
DAMRUS: Burzaan, you're going to be fine but you have to be still.
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise.
TUCKER: What did that?
REED: I didn't see it.
HOSHI [OC]: Go ahead, sir.
REED: We split off to follow another trail.
ARCHER: Tell Doctor Phlox to stand by.
HOSHI [OC]: Yes, sir.
DAMRUS: It was a drayjin. The females can be very aggressive,
especially if they're protecting a nest.
SHIRAHT: The wound's deep. Give me the bonding kit.
T'POL: There's no internal damage but he's lost a great deal of blood.
ARCHER: We've got a doctor on board our ship. I've alerted him to stand
by.
DAMRUS: We're prepared to deal with injuries here, Captain.
SHIRAHT: We need him for the hunt. Their doctor can help. We only have
two more days.
DAMRUS: Thank you, Captain. Obviously, we want him to have the best
treatment.
ARCHER: Let's get him back to the shuttlepod. You and Malcolm go with
him.
DAMRUS: You should all return to your ship. We came to this planet
aware of its dangers. You didn't.
ARCHER: I'm not ready to leave.
 [Archer's tent]
 T'POL: Lieutenant Reed reports they've docked with
Enterprise.
ARCHER: Thanks. T'Pol, come in. I saw her again, near the thermal
vents. She spoke to me.
T'POL: What did she say?
ARCHER: She said she needed me. I think someone may be trying to hurt
her.
T'POL: I believe you should reconsider returning to Enterprise.
ARCHER: And have Doctor Phlox take a look at me? There are no
psychotropic compounds here.
(He hands ove ar PADD.)
ARCHER: I wasn't hallucinating, and I wasn't dreaming.
T'POL: So the only logical conclusion is that she is a real human
woman?
ARCHER: I don't know what she is. I know it's not possible for her to
be human, but she's appearing to me for a reason and I'm going to
figure out what it is.
T'POL: How?
ARCHER: I'm going to find her.
T'POL: I'll go with you.
ARCHER: No.
T'POL: A well-armed hunter was nearly killed today. It would be foolish
to go into the jungle alone.
ARCHER: I have to. She's chosen to communicate with me. I don't know
why, but I don't think she'd reveal herself if anyone else was around.
T'POL: Is that your only reason for going by yourself?
ARCHER: What?
T'POL: With respect, Captain, I wonder if you would be so determined to
find this apparition if it were a scantily-clad man.
 [Sickbay]
 TUCKER: How's he doing, Doc?
PHLOX: It was a simple matter to synthesise his blood type for a
transfusion. He'll be back on his feet in a few hours.
TUCKER: I'll let the Captain know.
PHLOX: Commander, could you tell me what attacked him?
TUCKER: They call it a drayjin. It looks like a big nasty pig. Kind of
tastes like one, too.
PHLOX: I found cellular residue in the wound. It clearly doesn't belong
to this gentleman. I assume it must have come from the animal that
mauled him.
(They go over to a microscope)
TUCKER: What am I looking at?
PHLOX: The cells are in a state of chromosomal flux. They're mutating.
It's as if they're trying to change into something but can't quite
figure out what. That must have been a most unusual pig.
 [Thermal vents]
 ARCHER: Hello? Are you there?
(He starts scanning, then turns it and the torch off.)
ARCHER: I'm alone.
(He starts to walk but something has hold of his arm.)
WOMAN: Jonathan.
ARCHER: You're not a hallucination. You're real. I can touch you.
WOMAN: Real, yes.
ARCHER: But you're not human, are you.
WOMAN: Human?
ARCHER: Human, like me.
WOMAN: We are not like you.
ARCHER: We? There are more of you? Where? I haven't seen others.
WOMAN: We can become whatever you see. A tree, an animal, water,
whatever you see.
ARCHER: I see a beautiful woman.
WOMAN: Because you want to see a beautiful woman.
ARCHER: How do you know what I want?
(She touchs his temple.)
WOMAN: I can see your thoughts. I see what eludes you.
ARCHER: You're telepathic. That's how you know my language.
WOMAN: I know more than your language.
ARCHER: Then you must know why I'm so drawn to you. Why I feel like I
know you.
WOMAN: You do know me.
ARCHER: From where? Why did you choose me?
WOMAN: You're different.
ARCHER: You said that before. How? Who am I different from?
WOMAN: The others. The only ones who have ever come here, before you.
ARCHER: You mean the Eska.
WOMAN: Do you know why they come?
ARCHER: To hunt.
WOMAN: To hunt us, Jonathan. We are what they prize above all else.
 [Campsite]
 TUCKER: You lost the Drayjin but at least you got
some scars to show for it.
BURZAAN: Well, thanks to your doctor I don't even have that.
DAMRUS: To the Captain and his fine physician.
ARCHER: It was no problem, really.
SHIRAHT: Well, we have to drink to something since we came back
empty-handed.
ARCHER: To good hunting tomorrow.
ALL: Good hunting.
REED: So, how'd you lose them?
DAMRUS: Drayjin are migratory. By the time we got back, they moved on.
ARCHER: All those imaging sensors and you couldn't see where they went?
DAMRUS: They're more elusive than you give them credit for.
TUCKER: Apparently.
T'POL: Do you hunt on your own world?
DAMRUS: Yes.
ARCHER: Then why travel light years to hunt here? Seems like a long way
to come just to shoot a few wild pigs.
BURZAAN: We hunt more than wild pigs.
DAMRUS: The prey here is different.
ARCHER: Boar, wolves, some large reptiles. It doesn't seem that
different.
DAMRUS: Imagine hunting something that can get inside your mind, sense
your thoughts. Is that different enough?
ARCHER: What are you talking about?
BURZAAN: Wraiths.
TUCKER: You mean ghosts?
SHIRAHT: They might as well be.
ARCHER: Come on, fellas. That seems pretty far-fetched.
DAMRUS: Does it? You saw one yourself. Your mystery woman. She was
undoubtedly a wraith who wandered too close to camp.
ARCHER: But she looked human.
BURZAAN: You don't even know if it was a she.
SHIRAHT: They're shape-shifters. They can look like anything. Even
people you know.
DAMRUS: That's how they trick you.
T'POL: They sound like intelligent, sentient beings.
DAMRUS: Not the way you or I would measure intelligence. It's an
instinctual response.
BURZAAN: That's why we were tracking you the day you arrived. We
thought they'd taken your form.
SHIRAHT: They assume the exact characteristics of whatever they become.
They turn into a rock, all you see is a rock. Even on scanners.
DAMRUS: Before we learned how to spot them they killed more of us than
we did of them. My father came here with eight other hunters. They
drove a group of wraiths into a blind canyon. My father was sure that
they had them cut off. But when they moved in the wraiths were waiting.
They'd read the hunters' minds. They knew their plan. My father made it
out, but only two of his friends survived.
ARCHER: How do you catch them?
BURZAAN: In recent years, we learned when you corner them they panic,
especially the young ones.
DAMRUS: When they're afraid, they emit a chemical signature. Our
scanners have been modified to detect it. It gives us an advantage.
 [Situation room]
 ARCHER: They know damn well what they're doing.
T'POL: I find this as distasteful as you do, Captain. I'm just not sure
how we can stop them.
REED: They're well armed and they know the terrain. I wouldn't want to
try and take their weapons from them.
T'POL: We have no right to, in any case.
TUCKER: What right do they have to come to this planet and shoot the
locals?
ARCHER: Hunting wild boar is one thing, but they're killing a sentient
species.
T'POL: Even if we stop them, their people will continue to come here
and hunt. They've done it for hundreds of years.
ARCHER: Unless we find a more permanent solution.
PHLOX: Captain?
ARCHER: The hunters said the shape-shifters emit a chemical signature
when they're afraid. That's what gives them away. You have a sample of
their cells.
PHLOX: I've been analyzing their mutative ability. Quite remarkable.
ARCHER: Can you find a way to mask that chemical? That would shield
them from the hunters' scans.
PHLOX: I'll start right away.
ARCHER: We may not be able to stop them from hunting here, but we could
level the playing field.
 [Mess hall]
 TUCKER: Evening, Captain.
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: Get you anything?
ARCHER: No, thanks.
TUCKER: Milk, cold.
ARCHER: Do you know any poetry?
TUCKER: You mean besides 'There was a young lady from Ipswich'?
ARCHER: When I was a kid, if I had trouble sleeping my mother would
recite a poem to me. There was one I always asked for. Had a funny
name.  The
Song of the Wandering Aengus.
I didn't learn till I was older that it was by Yeats. 'I went out to
the hazel wood Because a fire was in my head.' Anyway, the man in the
poem catches a fish, and it turns into a beautiful woman with apple
blossoms in her hair. She calls his name and then vanishes.
TUCKER: And?
ARCHER: He spends the rest of his life searching for her. His vision of
perfection, I suppose. Something he could never quite find. It's her.
TUCKER: Captain.
ARCHER: When I listened to the poem I must have created an image of
that woman in my mind. I haven't thought about it in years. That's why
I didn't recognise her at first. She isn't someone that I ever knew,
she's someone I imagined as a child. The elusive woman from the poem.
TUCKER: Why do you think this shape-shifter reached into your mind and
picked an image you'd almost forgotten?
ARCHER: I don't know.
TUCKER: Maybe that poem's been on your mind more than you realise.
PHLOX [OC]: Phlox to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Archer.
PHLOX [OC]: Captain, I may have found something.
ARCHER: I'll be right there. She may just be something I envisioned a
long time ago, but I'll be damned if I'm going to let anyone shoot her.
 [Jungle]
 (Yhe hunters are in pursuit of a quarry, and
shooting as they go.)
BURZAAN: Are you sure?
SHIRAHT: It's a wraith.
BURZAAN: I'm not picking up a signature. It was probably just a
drayjin.
SHIRAHT: I saw it shift. It's a wraith.
DAMRUS: Stay with it.
(further on, the drayjin morphs into a dead tree trunk)
BURZAAN: Where is it?
SHIRAHT: I'm not picking up anything.
DAMRUS: It has to be here. There's no way out.
BURZAAN: Well, if it's cornered, it must be terrified. Why can't we
detect it?
DAMRUS: It may not be afraid now, but it's about to be.
(They fire randomly into the dark. The wraith morphs into a giant slug,
attacks and slithers off.)
SHIRAHT: I'm all right.
DAMRUS: Something's wrong. We should have seen it.
BURZAAN: Maybe our scanners aren't working.
DAMRUS: All of them?
(Animal sounds come from all around, louder and louder.)
BURZAAN: We need to leave.
DAMRUS: Let's get back to camp.
 [Campsite]
 ARCHER: How was the hunt? Any luck?
DAMRUS: What are you doing here?
ARCHER: We wanted to take a few more scans before we left. Is
everything all right?
DAMRUS: We're fine.
TUCKER: You sure? You look pretty rattled.
BURZAAN: Our scanners are malfunctioning.
ARCHER: Sorry to hear it. Looks like you won't be taking home any
trophies this year.
DAMRUS: Strange, but we never failed on a hunt before you arrived.
ARCHER: I guess we must be bad luck.
 [Thermal vents]
 ARCHER: Are you there?
WOMAN: Yes.
ARCHER: They're gone.
WOMAN: For now.
ARCHER: Did you give the others the masking agent?
WOMAN: Yes.
ARCHER: It'll keep you safe.
WOMAN: Thank you.
ARCHER: I know who you are.
WOMAN: You remembered.
ARCHER: Thank you for reminding me.
WOMAN: Never stop seeking what seems unobtainable. Goodbye, Jonathan.
(She touches his face, he takes her hand.)
WOMAN: Don't forget me.
(She morphs into a giant slug and glides away.)
ARCHER: I won't.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Aquisition
Acquisition
 Original Airdate: 27 Mar, 2002
  (As
Enterprise hangs motionless in space, a small vessel approaches.)
 [Alien ship]
 (Three males with enormous earlobes are seen in
the little ship - a fourth enters shot during the dialogue.)
ULIS: Kora noosa. Kora noosa!
MUK: Irr zoun nagool ahsp.
ULIS: Uch. Cucht eeta ekrajhn-voy?
GRISH: (piloting) Irr gnales. Nohm setron quethivoo.
ULIS: NanDi. Vanee eday.
(They come alongside Enterprise and dock.)
 [Corridor]
 (They enter by the starboard airlock wearing
gasmasks, and we see the crew slumped against the bulkheads,
unconscious.)
MUK: Cucht nee va zeh? (Krem sees how small human ears are,)
KREM: Nass. (Muk tells him to hurry up.)
MUK: Y-solah-na. Y-solah-na!
 [Mess hall]
(Krem fingers some food.) MUK: Krem. Tenda sout
bazul. Ningor. Ningor!
 [Engineering]
(Awed by the engine.)  KREM: Oh! Gard-day latinum
sou-tah!
MUK: Lahje. Sapa-moul! (don't touch)
KREM: Ehj saf-rey tomen-dee.
MUK: Konah see-oh-mahj irr zoon. (Krem spots T'Pol lying against the bulkhead.)
KREM: Ooo. Senpa tah-moy.
Lorala rrela. Latinum soun teyvalah.
MUK: Ulis tenda vool.
 [Turbolift]
 MUK: Sa mopree. (They remove their gas masks.)
 [Bridge]
 (Everyone looks asleep at their posts)
MUK: La-voy Daemon. (Krem sets off an alarm on helm.) MUK: Leru deemo mirra.
Mirra. (He gets out his communicator.) MUK: Muk lat Ulis.
 [Alien ship]
 ULIS: Klaxut.
MUK [OC]: Feesha vou dolay.
ULIS: Rejahvey.
 [Decon chamber]
 (Tucker wakes up. He is wearing blue singlet and shorts.)
TUCKER: Doc, isn't my time up yet? You
said twenty minutes.
 [Sickbay]
 TUCKER [OC]: It's been at least an hour. I'm
getting a little well-done in here. Doctor?
(But Phlox is spark out on the floor.)
 [Decon chamber]
 TUCKER: Hello? (He tries the door, then uses the
panel to short out the lock and leave. He discovers the unconscious
crewmen in the corridors and turbolift. At the airlock, Ulis and Grish put a ramp over the door lip and
wheel trolleys onto Enterprise/)
 [Sickbay]
 (Tucker finds Phlox, then hears voices approaching
and hides.)
MUK: Sel treoght da-techt.
KREM: Ehj ocuuz sahfi?
MUK: Guzah louz.
(The pair start stuffing sacks with medical supplies. Krem looks in one
of Phlox's cages and yelps,)
MUK: La ruvah tahp! (Tucker
watches from the top of an access ladder. As the looters make their way
through the ship, Tucker keeps watch. In a corridor, he watches as Ulis
wheels a
torpedo along on his trolley. On the Bridge, Ulis even strips off the
dedication plaque from the
wall. In Engineering, Krem strokes T'Pol's face then drags her
away. Grish even takes Travis's chair. Krem raids the mess
hall, doesn't like the smell of salad but takes
desserts. Muk swaps his boots for some found in a cupboard. Iin
the Launch bay, it looks like they've taken all the women they've
found, not just T'Pol but also Hoshi and others. Tucker makes it
to his desk in Engineering and watches on a monitor as
Archer is lifted out of his chair and carried away.)
 [Launch bay]
 ULIS: Ingala habi. (Grish injects Archer and he
wakes up, handcuffed to a stanchion.)
ARCHER: Who are you?
ULIS: Ingala duk habi? (Krem cautiously holds out a translator while
Muk has a rifle.)
ARCHER: I don't understand.
ULIS: Duk habi nakustra?
ARCHER: What?
ULIS: Bok, megoron duk what I'm saying?
MUK: Sit down!
ARCHER: Who the hell are you?
ULIS: Who we are is unimportant. Do you command this ship?
ARCHER: I'm the captain. (Archer sees the women.) ARCHER: What have you done to my
crew?
ULIS: They're sleeping. They won't be harmed as long as you cooperate.
ARCHER: What do you want?
ULIS: Where is the location of your vault?
ARCHER: Vault? I don't know what you're talking about.
KREM: Maybe the translator's malfunctioning.
ULIS: He understands.
ARCHER: This is a vessel of exploration not a cargo ship. We don't do
any commerce. Whatever it is you're after, you won't find it here.
ULIS: You carry no valuables of any kind? No precious gems, no latinum?
ARCHER: I just told you.
MUK: Liar! (Muk hits Archer.)
ARCHER: Whoever you are, just take what you want and get off of my
ship.
KREM: Cousin, maybe we should. We've made some good acquisitions
already.
MUK: There's more here. He's hiding something.
GRISH: I agree with Krem. Let's take what we have and go.
ULIS: What do we have? Scanners, low-grade weapons. (Archer spots Tucker
watching from above.)ULIS:  Nothing but trinkets.
KREM: Don't forget about the females. Some of them are worth their
weight in latinum. If we leave now we can make the next slave market on
Stameris.
ARCHER: Slave market?
ULIS: You're right, Krem. Pick out the females that will bring the best
price.
KREM: I already have.
ULIS: It was a pleasure doing business with you.
ARCHER: Wait.
ULIS: You've reconsidered?
ARCHER: I'll show you where the vault is, if you let me keep half the
gold.
ULIS: Gold-pressed latinum?
ARCHER: Gold bars. Hundreds of them. But I keep half.
ULIS: Ten percent.
ARCHER: Forty.
ULIS: Fifteen.
ARCHER: Thirty five and not a bar less. You'll never find the vault
without my help.
ULIS: Twenty percent. Final offer.
ARCHER: No deal. I'd rather you take the women and go.
GRISH: Thirty-five percent. That's not a bad offer, Ulis. Maybe we
should consider it.
ULIS: No. We'll find the vault ourselves. Krem, start loading the
merchandise.
KREM: Why am I always stuck doing the menial labour?
ULIS: Make him do it.
(Muk gives Krem the rifle and the other three leave.)
 [Alien cargo bay]
 (Compared with the Launch bay, it's tiny. Krem has
Archer lugging boxes. His overalls are tied around his waist.)
KREM: Oh, not there. Over here.
ARCHER: If you're going to make a habit out of this, you might want to
get a bigger ship.
KREM: It's not my ship. It's my cousin's.
ARCHER: Really. I was getting the impression you were in charge.
KREM: This is only my first month on the job.
ARCHER: How do you like it so far?
KREM: My cousin's a skillful merchant. I'm learning a lot from him.
You'd better slide that over to make room for the others.
ARCHER: What do you need all this for, anyway? You seem to already have
plenty of technology.
KREM: One can never have too much. The Rules of Acquisition say 'Expand
or die'.
ARCHER: Rules of Acquisition?
KREM: That's rule number forty five. I've memorised all a hundred and
seventy three, including the most important one. A man is only worth
the sum of his possessions.
ARCHER: Back on my home world that kind of thinking almost destroyed
our civilisation.
KREM: You should've managed your businesses better. Come on. We have a
lot more moving to do.
ARCHER: We?
 [Corridor]
 (There are those handy ramps over all the bulkhead
door edges.)
ARCHER: So what do you do, split the profits equally between the four
of you?
KREM: Oh, my cousin determines the shares.
ARCHER: You must get a bigger percentage than your crewmates.
KREM: Actually, I get the smallest.
ARCHER: Oh, that doesn't seem fair. You're the one doing all the work.
KREM: My cousin knows what's best for me. He manages all my financial
transactions.
ARCHER: Really.
KREM: I don't have the lobes for business.
ARCHER: I assume he charges you for his services.
KREM: Of course. (Archer spots Trip hiding around a corner.) KREM: He wouldn't
be a very good businessman if he didn't. Never allow family to stand in
the way of profit.
ARCHER: Another one of your rules?
KREM: Number six. My cousin's going to help me acquire my own ship some
day.
ARCHER: (coughing) Do you think you could bring me a glass of water?
(Krem handcuffs him to a handrail.) ARCHER: It comes out of a dispenser in the
mess hall.
KREM: I'll be right back.
ARCHER: Oh, do you think you could bring me some food while you're at
it? Whatever's left in the serving case. That is, if you haven't
already taken everything.
(Krem heads off and Trip dashes over to try and free him.)
TUCKER: You all right, Captain?
ARCHER: Never better. You?
TUCKER: From what I can tell, you and I are the only ones on the ship
still standing. I would've tried to wake some of the others but there's
nothing left in Sickbay to do it with.
ARCHER: I'm not surprised. These aliens are taking everything they can
get their hands on. (Tucker fails to undo the handcuffs.)
TUCKER: Who are they?
ARCHER: I don't know yet. Can you get a phase pistol?
TUCKER: They've cleaned out the armoury.
ARCHER: There are fourteen weapons lockers on this ship. They can't
have emptied every one of them.
TUCKER: Trust me, Captain, I've already checked.
ARCHER: I've got an idea, but you're going to need some help to pull it
off. They used a hypospray to wake me up. It's in Launch bay two. (Krem returns with a glass of water and half eaten sandwich.)
KREM: This is
pretty good.
ARCHER: Glad you're enjoying it.
KREM: Maybe we should take your cook with us.
ARCHER: Do you mind? (Krem puts the glass and food into Archer's hands
while he hunts for the handcuff keys.)
 [Launch bay]
 (Tucker finds the hypospray and injects T'Pol, then
Hoshi.)
T'POL: Commander.
TUCKER: You're going to be fine. Just because a guy's in his underwear
you think the worst. (Hoshi isn't waking up.)
T'POL: I assume you have an explanation.
TUCKER: Doctor Phlox made me clear bio-scan after I got back from that
lunar survey. While I was in decon, something knocked out the entire
crew. Aliens are in control of the ship.
T'POL: That artefact you brought back from the lunar surface. It must
have been placed there intentionally. When I opened it, the canister
released some kind of gas.
(The door opens, T'Pol lies down again and Trip hides.)
KREM: This female is different from the others. What species is she?
ARCHER: She's a Vulcan.
KREM: Vulcan.  (Archer wheels a cabinet away.)
ARCHER:They're really not all that
interesting once you get to know them.
KREM: I'd like to get to know this one. Maybe I won't sell her. Not
right away.
ARCHER: Trust me. She's got no sense of humor. She's always
complaining. (Krem adores her pointed ears.) ARCHER: Krem.
(They leave with the cabinet.)
TUCKER: You okay?
T'POL: There are times I wish Vulcans hadn't learned to repress their
violent tendencies.
TUCKER: Come on, we've got work to do.
T'POL: What about the others?
TUCKER: I can't wake anybody else up. This hypospray is empty. Let's
go, unless you want to be sold into slavery.
(In a crewman's quarters, Trip puts on a uniform overall, for modesty's
sake.)
 [Sickbay]
(Muk scans the body scanner.)  MUK: There's nothing
here.
GRISH: You're not scanning deep enough. This is their vault. I saw one
just like it on a Gavarian ship.
MUK: Why would they keep a vault in the medical bay?
ULIS: Rule of Acquisition number twenty three. Nothing is more
important than your health, except for your money.
MUK: I don't see a locking mechanism.
GRISH: It must use some sort of magnetic seal. I'll need micro-charges
to blow it open.
ULIS: Hold on. (He touches the right bit of the monitor screen and the
door opens, then the gurney extends out,)
MUK: This is a waste of time. We've only got three hours before they
begin to wake. It'll take days to search every hatch.
ULIS: We'll find it, Muk. Be patient. Open those.
 [unidentifiable place]
 (T'Pol watches their activities.)
GRISH [on monitor]: Empty.
MUK [on monitor]: Ah! I found something.
ULIS [on monitor]: Gold?
MUK [on monitor]: No,
 [Sickbay]
 MUK: But it looks like quality merchandise. (A
gun-type thing with a very long nozzle.) MUK: Splendid craftsmanship.
ULIS: Add it to the pot.
MUK: Do I look like a Menk to you? This beauty's going in my personal
collection.
ULIS: We agreed to split our profits.
MUK: You said this ship would make us rich. We'll be lucky if we break
even.
ULIS: We had a deal.
MUK: I'm amending it. Anything I find, I keep.
ULIS: Fine. I'll just deduct it from your share of the gold.(Trip attaches a security lock to the Biomatter
resequencing section door)
 [Situation room]
 MUK: What's wrong, Ulis? Can't find your pot of
gold?
ULIS: What's all this?
MUK: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't touch.
ULIS: If you're not going to help us you should return to the ship. And
what are you doing?
GRISH: Looking for the vault.
ULIS: They're not going to put it on a map, you idiot.
GRISH: I know that, but look. If I'm not mistaken these are the
Captain's quarters.
 [Outside the Bridge]
 (T'Pol is eavesdropping on the alien's
conversation.)
ULIS [OC]: So?
GRISH [OC]: That's where you keep your latinum.
 [Situation room]
 ULIS: What's the quickest route?
GRISH: We could take this elevator to this deck
 [Outside the Bridge]
 GRISH [OC]: And cut through here.
ULIS [OC]: It's worth a look.
(T'Pol taps her PADD.)
 [Situation room]
 (An ear-bleeding noise makes the aliens cringe)
ULIS: Weapons! Where is it coming from?
GRISH: Over here!
(T'Pol sneaks in and takes some of the small boxes Muk has collected.)
GRISH: Make it stop!
(Muk shoots T'Pol's console and the noise stops.)
ULIS: Let's get to their Captain's quarters. (Muk returns to the situation room.)
MUK: Where are my scanners? I left
them right here!
ULIS: You should be more careful with your acquisitions.
MUK: Oh, oh! Open your bag.
ULIS: No.
MUK: Open it.
ULIS: Are you calling me a thief?
MUK: Everybody knows you'd steal the wax out of your own mother's ears.
GRISH: Please, gentlemen. We're partners.
 [Outside the Bridge]
 MUK [OC]: Partners don't rob from each other.
ULIS [OC]: Why would I bother taking some worthless scanners?
(T'Pol touches her PADD.)
 [Situation room]
 (A beeping sound emanates from Ulis's bag. Muk
grabs it and finds his scanners.)
MUK: Worthless?
ULIS: I didn't put them there.
MUK: Oh, really? Then who did?
ULIS: I tell you, I don't know.
MUK: Maybe they just jumped off the table and crawled inside. Where's
the other one? There were three.
GRISH: Don't look at me.
MUK: Give it back.
GRISH: Get away.
MUK: Come back here!
 [Outside the Bridge]
 (T'Pol holds a scanner in her hand.)
MUK [OC]: You heard me, you no-good cheating liar!
 [Engineering]
 KREM: There. That one.
ARCHER: I'm surprised your friend didn't get electrocuted. You can't
just yank out an antimatter injector like it was a light bulb.
KREM: Would you mind?
ARCHER: I'll have to take the injector assembly offline.
KREM: Warp core parts are in high demand.
ARCHER: Even if your cousin does find the vault, what makes you think
he's going to share the gold with you?
KREM: We have a contract.
ARCHER: If you never see the vault, you'll never know what's in it. He
could try to cheat you out of your share.
KREM: He wouldn't cheat me.
ARCHER: What happened to 'Never allow family to stand in the way of
profit'? I've seen the way the others treat you. One of them said you
have no talent for business. Why not prove them wrong? I've got a
proposition for you. Help me capture your associates and I'll show you
where the vault is. We'll split the gold, fifty-fifty. Once they're in
the Brig you can fly off a wealthy man. You said you've always dreamed
of having your own ship.
KREM: How do I know you won't double-cross me?
ARCHER: You're the one holding the gun. Think about it. No more taking
orders, getting stuck with the menial work. I'll even throw in the
Vulcan female. So, what'll it be? Opportunities like this don't come
along every day.
KREM: Get back to work.
ARCHER: It's your loss.
 [Archer's quarters]
 GRISH: Where is the vault? Do you understand me?
(Porthos wages his tail and woofs.)
GRISH: I can't lock on to its language.
MUK: It's a lower lifeform, you fool. Probably the captain's next meal.
GRISH: Don't be so sure. Look at the size of its ears.
MUK: Ooo, I could get several bars of latinum for this creature at the
Malurzian Zoo. (He picks up Porthos.)
ULIS: There's nothing here. Let's search the other quarters.
MUK: I've had enough of vault hunting for one day. You two have fun.
 [Alien cargo bay]
 (Muk puts Porthos into a large box, then turns to
see someone trying to hide.)
MUK: Who's there?
(Trip makes a run for it/)
MUK: (into communicator) One of the aliens is awake.
(He chases him through the corridors. In the mess hall, Tucker pretends to be out cold at a table but
Muk spots him. They fight and Trip bites Muk's ear, takes his weapon
and runs out,)
 [Corridor]
 (Ulis uses an electric whip to disarm Tucker,)
ULIS: Why aren't you asleep? (He whips him again.)
 [Launch bay]
 ARCHER: What's next? (Krem points at something out
of shot.) ARCHER: Where do you expect me to put it? There's hardly any room left
on your ship. I think it's time you decided what you really want to
keep.
KREM: I'll ask Ulis.
ARCHER: Can't you make a simple decision by yourself? If you want to
run your own ship someday, maybe you should start showing a little
initiative.
KREM: I'm not the one in charge.
ARCHER: And you never will be, with that attitude. (Ulis, Muk and Grish
enter with Tucker.)
ULIS: Who's this?
ARCHER: My Chief Engineer.
ULIS: Why is he awake?
ARCHER: Don't ask me.
ULIS: Are there others?
ARCHER: I haven't seen anybody. (to Krem) You?
GRISH: The anaesthesia isn't supposed to wear off for another two
hours. Maybe we used the wrong dosage. There could be others awake. We
should leave.
ULIS: Not without the gold.
MUK: Forget the gold. We'll never find it.
ULIS: If you want to leave, take one of their shuttlecraft. I'll be
happy to keep your share.
MUK: You expect me to go empty-handed?
ULIS: You can keep the shuttlecraft, and the females.
MUK: That's not good enough. (Ulis pulls a weapon.)
ULIS: It'll have to be.
MUK: You'll regret this, Ulis.
ULIS: Get out.
MUK: Grish, help me with the women.
TUCKER: Wait. I'll show you the vault.
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: Leave the women here, and I'll let you have the gold.
ARCHER: Not another word, Commander. That's an order.
TUCKER: I'm not letting them take my wife.
ULIS: Wife?
KREM: She's not the one with the pointy ears, is she?
TUCKER: No. Her name's Hoshi, and you're going to keep your filthy
hands off her. Do we have a deal?
ARCHER: You take them anywhere near that vault, and I'll throw you in
the Brig for insubordination.
TUCKER: You don't give a damn about this crew. All you care about is
your precious gold.
ARCHER: I'm warning you, Trip.
TUCKER: You're a greedy son of a bitch.
ARCHER: What's your wife worth? Five bars of gold, maybe six? Let them
take Hoshi, and I'll give you ten.
TUCKER: What!
ARCHER: All right, fifteen. (Tucker launches himself at Archer and they
wrestle, sort of. Muk and Ulis pull them apart.)
ULIS: Enough! I accept your offer.
TUCKER: You'll leave the women?
ULIS: You have my word as a businessman.
TUCKER: Follow me.
ULIS: Wait here. I'll go.
MUK: So you can cheat us out of our share? Hide it in the bottom of
your bag? I plan to count every bar of that gold myself before it
leaves the vault.
ULIS: We'll count it later.
MUK: Oh, I know you too well, Ulis.
GRISH: If he's going, I'm going.
KREM: Me, too.
ULIS: We can't all go. Time's running out. Someone has to stay and
finish loading the ship.
GRISH: That's Krem's job.
KREM: I'm tired of doing this job. I don't want to do all the menial
work.
ULIS: Krem.
KREM: It's time that I showed a little initiative. I have the lobes for
business. You just never give me the chance to prove it.
ULIS: Get back to work!
KREM: Yes, cousin. (The others leave.)
ARCHER: You sure told him.
KREM: Get back to work. (Archer leans over and goes ouch.)
ARCHER: My back.
KREM: What about it?
ARCHER: I think I pulled a muscle. It's an old water-polo injury.
Flares up every now and then. I just need to rest.
KREM: We don't have any time. If Ulis comes back and we're not
finished.
ARCHER: Then you'd better get working. (Krem handcuffs him to a
handrail and gets on with lugging boxes to the ship.)
 [Turbolift]
 ULIS: Where are we going?
TUCKER: Bottom deck.
MUK: We already looked there.
TUCKER: You obviously didn't look in the right place.
ULIS: After you.
 [Alien cargo hold]
 T'POL: Have you come to rescue me?
KREM: How did you wake up?
T'POL: Whatever put the others to sleep didn't affect me in the same
way. My body works differently than the humans.
KREM: Humans?
T'POL: That's the name of their species. They're a terrible race.
Deceitful, cruel.
KREM: Then why do you live with them?
T'POL: It wasn't my choice. I'm a captive here. They've enslaved me.
Please, take me with you.
KREM: You would make a handsome wife. Do you know how to perform
oo-mox?
T'POL: I'm well-trained in the arts of pleasure, but I'm not familiar
with oo-mox.
KREM: My lobes. Stroke my lobes.
T'POL: Like this? (She does a double handed caress.)
KREM: Yes. (Krem turns to jelly in her hands)
T'POL: And this?
KREM: Oh, yes! (Then she neck-pinches him, and takes the handcuff keys
and a phase pistol.)
 [Jefferies tube]
 ULIS: Haven't we been through this section?
TUCKER: Not yet.
ULIS: I recognise that conduit.
TUCKER: We have a thousand conduits like that on this ship.
MUK: We're going in circles.
TUCKER: This way.
 [Corridor]
 GRISH: Isn't there a more direct route?
TUCKER: That's the beauty of this thing. It's impossible to find unless
you know exactly where you're going.
ULIS: How much further?
TUCKER: Keep your shirt on. It's close.
 [Jefferies tube]
 TUCKER: Watch your head.
MUK: Is this your plan, to walk us to death?
ULIS: Is this some kind of trick?
 [Biomatter recycling]
 TUCKER: Relax. We're here.
(The three aliens try to go through the hatch at the same time to see
Trip working at the lock he installed earlier.)
GRISH: The vault?
TUCKER: It's all yours.
ULIS: Open it. Open it! (Tucker opens the hatch slightly.)
TUCKER: Better let me go in first.
ULIS: Why?
TUCKER: Knowing Captain Archer, he's probably rigged the place with
booby traps. Just give me a few minutes to check it out.
MUK: No! You could have a weapon hidden in there. (Tucker stands aside.)
ULIS: I'll go.
MUK: Not without me, you won't. You'll fill your pockets with gold.
ULIS: Take your hands off me!
GRISH: We don't have all day.
ULIS: Get away from that hatch! Out of my way!
GRISH: Thief! I want my share!
ULIS: It's mine!
MUK: Get back, or I'll gnaw your hands off!
GRISH: My gold! My gold!
(The three dash into the room, where T'Pol is hiding behind the door.)
ULIS: It's a trap!
(T'Pol stuns them with a phase pistol)
TUCKER: Sorry fellas, bank must be closed today.
 [Launch bay]
 ARCHER: Did it work?
T'POL: Perfectly. (Archer holds out his manacled wrists.)
ARCHER: Do you have the key?
T'POL: Not that interesting. No sense of humour. Always complaining.
ARCHER: I'll make it up to you.
T'POL: How?
ARCHER: Five bars of gold? Open these things, Sub-Commander. That's an
order. (Trip supervises Muk and Grish putting the
torpedoes back in the Armoury where they belong.)
 [Alien cargo bay]
 (Archer releases Porthos from the box and gives
him a big cuddle.)
ARCHER: Yeah, Porthos. You okay?
 [Alien ship]
 ARCHER: I'm going to be contacting the Vulcan High
Command as well as Starfleet. If you come within a light year of any
one of our ships you won't know what hit you.
KREM: You'll never see us again.
(The other three are tied up.)
ARCHER: If you want to be unshackled, you might think about showing
Krem here a little more respect.
MUK: Vermin.
ULIS: Release me, and I'll forget this ever happened.
KREM: Later, maybe. If you're nice.
ULIS: Let me go, you idiot!
KREM: Shut up! (to T'Pol) Are you sure you want to stay here with the
hu-mans? With my ship and your talents we could build a vast fortune.
(T'Pol walks away, Archer right behind her.)
ULIS: I'll let you have my latinum pen. The one you've always had your
eye on.
KREM: No thanks.
ULIS: My beetle-snuff collection. (Krem settles into the Captain's chair.)
KREM: Makes me sneeze.
ULIS: Name your price.
GRISH: Whatever he offers you, I'll double it.
ULIS: Krem! We're family.
MUK: I know a Bolian female. I could introduce you.
(Krem takes hold of the flight controls, the little ship undocks and
flies away without us ever learning the name of their race.)

  [Captain's
mess]
(The food is making Tucker's eyes water.)TUCKER: I thought Cajun food was
hot. (Archer takes a bite and nearly loses his voice.)
ARCHER: D'Marr, what do you
call that spice? (A white-skinned alien, reptilian with frills around the jaw and
large scale plates on the head.)
D'MARR:  Hajjlaran. The warlords on Preenos use
it to test their courage. (to T'Pol) You sure you won't have some?
T'POL: My courage doesn't need testing.
D'MARR: I have other items to trade. I can get you some Triaxian silk
for, say, another protein resequencer?
TUCKER: I bet you'd look good in Triaxian silk.
ARCHER: What we really need are engineering supplies.
TUCKER: Raw duratanium, dilithium ore.
D'MARR: I'm sorry, I prefer to deal in more exotic goods. But, about
two days from here there's a small system. You might find what you're
looking for there.
T'POL: We haven't detected any inhabited planets on long range scans.
D'MARR: It's not inhabited. Not exactly.
ARCHER: What do you mean? (D'Marr takes a drink.)
D'MARR: Mmm! This is excellent. What is it again?
ARCHER: Coffee. I can have my Chef wrap up a few kilograms for you if
you wouldn't mind telling us where we can find those supplies.
D'MARR: Captain, please. This isn't a matter of negotiation. I'm
thinking of your safety.
ARCHER: Ten kilos?
D'MARR: It's pure luck that I even found it.
TUCKER: Found what?
D'MARR: A ship, crashed on one of the inner planets. There were no
lifesigns aboard, so I landed to claim my rights of salvage.
TUCKER: What'd you find?
D'MARR: A transport vessel, largely intact. I could have stripped it
bare and made a fortune.
T'POL: Why didn't you?
D'MARR: The, er, crew objected.
ARCHER: You said there weren't any lifesigns aboard.
D'MARR: There weren't. There wasn't anything alive.
TUCKER: What are you saying, the ship was haunted?
 [Bridge]
 (Enterprise is in orbit of a planet.)
T'POL: The atmosphere is thin, but breathable.
ARCHER: Any biosigns?
T'POL: As the trader said, none.
REED: I've located the ship, sir.
ARCHER: Let's see it. (A grey triangle on a grey ground with a few
wispy clouds around.)
T'POL: No power signatures. It appears to be deserted.
TUCKER: But are your sensors calibrated for ghosts? So far D'Marr's
batting a thousand. I'm reading duratanium, beryllium and dilithium.
HOSHI: I wonder what caused the crash.
ARCHER: There's no way to tell without a closer look.
TUCKER: Let's get down there.
TRAVIS: Are we sure that's a good idea?
HOSHI: You're not afraid it's really haunted, are you?
TRAVIS: We don't know what happened to the crew. That ship could be a
tomb. You really think we should be picking through it for spare parts,
sir?
TUCKER: D'Marr didn't say anything about bodies. Captain, we've taken
more damage out here than we ever expected to. There's enough
duratanium down there to patch a lot of hull fractures.
ARCHER: Let's pay her a visit. If we feel the spirits don't want us
there, we'll leave. Malcolm, you have the Bridge.
REED: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: Travis, you're driving.
 [Alien ship]
 (The shuttlepod lands next to the transport ship,
and the group force their way onboard.) ARCHER: T'Pol?
T'POL: Nothing.
TUCKER: According to D'Marr, Engineering should be that way.
ARCHER: You and T'Pol check it out. Comm. us if you find anything we
can use. Or if you see any signs of the crew.
TUCKER: Aye, Captain. (They leave.)
ARCHER: Everything okay, Travis?
TRAVIS: Yes, sir. I was just wondering. If that trader left in such a
hurry, why'd he bother to close the hatch behind him?
 [Alien Engineering]
 (T'Pol and Tucker examine equipment, then she
hears a noise from behind one of the lozenge-shaped doors.)
TUCKER: What is it?
T'POL: I heard something.
TUCKER: Rats, maybe?
T'POL: No.
TUCKER: Well, then you probably imagined it.
T'POL: Vulcans don't imagine things.
TUCKER: It's nothing to be ashamed of. A spooky ship, a missing crew
things going bump in the night. It'd give anybody the creeps.
T'POL: The creeps?
TUCKER: Yeah, willies. Heebie-jeebies. What, don't you get frightened
every once in a while?
T'POL: No.
TUCKER: Not by anything?
T'POL: No.
TUCKER: That's too bad. Nothing like a good scare.
deleted scene
T'POL: Fear is a primitive emotion.
TUCKER: There's got to be something that scares you. Heights, spiders?
T'POL: When I was recalled from Enterprise by the High Command, I
learned the crew was preparing a 'going-away' party. I found the
prospect somewhat frightening. 
(Archer and Travis are also exploring)
TRAVIS: What do you think that trader really saw down here, sir?
ARCHER: I don't know. Maybe someone else wanted to salvage this wreck
and they were trying to scare him off.
TRAVIS: That makes sense, except scavengers would've stripped this ship
to the keel.
ARCHER: This isn't turning into one of your famous ghost stories, is
it?
TRAVIS: Would make a good one, sir. (Archer shines a light on a console with two large discs with handles on
them.)
ARCHER: What do you think? Computer terminal?
TRAVIS: Yes, sir. There's no power but the data modules look intact.
ARCHER: Let's get them back to the ship see if we can find out what
happened here.
 [Alien Engineering]
 TUCKER: It's dilithium, all right. Huh.
T'POL: Something wrong?
TUCKER: No. The crystals are in perfect shape. Wouldn't be that hard to
get this ship flying again.
(T'Pol swings her light behind them.)
TUCKER: What is it?
T'POL: There's someone here.
TUCKER: You said there weren't any biosigns.
T'POL: There aren't.
TUCKER: If you're trying to scare me I appreciate the effort, but(A
shadow runs across the junction.) TUCKER: Tucker to Captain Archer.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
TUCKER: We're not alone down here.
ARCHER [OC]: We're on our way.
(Weapons drawn, the two examine an apparent dead end.)
T'POL: There's a space behind this bulkhead.
(Trip uses his phase pistol to cut the door open. They go through to
another door which opens to reveal an area filled with lush plants.)
TUCKER: Why didn't any of this show up on sensors?
T'POL: There appears to be a dampening field in this section of the
ship.
TUCKER: What's generating it?
T'POL: I'm reading a power source but I can't pinpoint its location.
TUCKER: Then let's do some pinpointing. (A little further along he
meets a blond woman.) TUCKER: Hi. (He lowers his weapon.) TUCKER: Sorry. It's okay, I'm not
going to hurt you. (She runs.) TUCKER: Hey! T'Pol!
(They give chase into a room where there are a whole bunch of armed and
suspicious people with a small cluster of bumps on their temples.)
Deleted scene
T'POL: Is this your vessel? (She gets out her communicator and activates the UT.)
T'POL: Can you understand me?
TUCKER: I can tell you're surprised to see us. You probably think we're
scavengers. I'll be honest with you, that was pretty much the plan. But
we didn't know there was anyone here. Believe it or not, we thought you
were ghosts. (The group lowers their weapons.) 
KUULAN: (grey-haired man in brown) We were on our way back from our
colony on Kotara Barath. We came under attack as we passed this system.
ARCHER: Who attacked you?
KUULAN: They didn't introduce themselves, they just opened fire.
EZRAL: (older man wearing blue) We're a supply ship. We don't carry
large weapons. We tried to defend ourselves.
MAYA: (woman in pink and grey) The Captain was able to make a crash
landing. It's a miracle we all survived.
TRAVIS: Didn't you send out a distress call?
KUULAN: If we had, it would have let the raiders know where we were.
TUCKER: So you set up this dampening field to hide.
MAYA: We were afraid they'd come down and finish what they started.
T'POL: How long have you been here?
EZRAL: Nearly three years.
ARCHER: Three years. You've made quite a home for yourselves here.
KUULAN: We didn't have much choice.
ARCHER: Well, you do now. Our ship is big enough for all of you. We can
take you home.
KUULAN: You're very generous, Captain, but our world is over a year
away.
TRAVIS: Well, we can't just leave you here.
KUULAN: As you say, we've made a home for ourselves.
ARCHER: What about their engines?
TUCKER: Their dilithium matrix is stable. They've got plenty of
antimatter reserves. I think we can get this ship flying.
EZRAL: We've tried, believe me.
ARCHER: We have resources you may not have. It's worth a shot.
EZRAL: Thank you, Captain.
 [Alien Engineering]
 (Trip is working alone in semi-darkness when he
hears a noise. He takes his flashlight to investigate, finds nothing,
then turns around to see a blonde girl in a brown cardigan.)
TUCKER: Oh! You startled me. That's twice in one day. You ever say
anything? Unless you're unable to say anything, in which case I
apologize. (he returns to his work)
LIANA: Don't touch that. The power's been routed to our living area
through that relay. It's very dangerous.
TUCKER: I'm glad you finally decided to speak up. Thanks.
LIANA: You're welcome.
TUCKER: You know a lot about your ship's systems?
LIANA: My father's the engineer. He taught me how things work.
TUCKER: Well, stick around then. You can warn me about whatever else I
need to keep my hands off.
MAYA: He's busy. Don't bother him, Liana.
TUCKER: It's okay. I could use the company.
MAYA: My daughter has other responsibilities. (They leave. Later, working in full light.)
T'POL: These relays are cross-circuited.
TUCKER: Liana and her father rerouted power where they needed it. See
here? They shunted helm control to airponics.
T'POL: Efficient, but I'll need to reconnect the Bridge systems.
TUCKER: I'll ask Liana to give you a hand.
T'POL: That's not necessary.
TUCKER: It'll go faster.
T'POL: I can take care of it.
TUCKER: She knows the ship's system inside and out. She kept me from
getting fried on a live plasma feed.
T'POL: Perhaps she can help you then.
TUCKER: What's that supposed to mean?
T'POL: By the way you keep talking about her you obviously appreciate
her technical expertise.
TUCKER: She's very competent.
T'POL: So was the female engineer on the Xyrillian ship.
TUCKER: You're never going to let that go, are you.
T'POL: I'm simply noting that the last time you found someone this
competent you wound up carrying her child. (Liana enters bearing a tray with fruit on it.)
LIANA: Am I interrupting?
T'POL: Not at all. Commander Tucker and I were just discussing his
previous repair experience.
LIANA: I thought you might like something to eat.
T'POL: No, thank you. (to Trip) I'm going to remove those power shunts
on the Bridge. (T'Pol leaves.)
LIANA: Are you hungry?
TUCKER: Thanks. (He takes a spoonful from the middle of the melon-like
fruit.) TUCKER: Mmm. It's delicious. What is it?
LIANA: It's called lorella. We grow it in the airponics bay. Nothing'll
take root outside.
TUCKER: I'm not surprised. It's amazing you were able to survive out
here. Why do I feel like it's feeding time at the zoo?
LIANA: I didn't mean to be rude.
TUCKER: Please. I wish more women paid that much attention to me.
LIANA: Do you know a lot of women?
TUCKER: Well, nearly a third of the crew is female.
LIANA: What about on, what did you call your planet?
TUCKER: Earth. I've got lady friends back there, but nobody special, if
that's what you mean. Not anymore. What about your world? Kantare?
LIANA: What about it?
TUCKER: Well, as soon as we get your engines fixed you'll be going
back, seeing your friends. I bet you're looking forward to that. (her
expression says otherwise)
KUULAN: Commander? I hear you've been making progress.
TUCKER: We're getting there.
KUULAN: There is something else you might be able to help us with.
 [Alien computer core]
 (A room with lots of large bolt-heads stuck on the
walls and a central console with five conduits coming out of the top of
it.)
T'POL: Your computer core?
KUULAN: It controls all the ship's vital functions. Environmental
systems, main power. You might say it keeps us alive.
T'POL: These are optronic relays.
KUULAN: Yes, and the system's beginning to degrade. It could fail at
any time.
TUCKER: I've worked on something like this. On a Xyrillian ship.
KUULAN: Then you can fix it?
TUCKER: I can try. I'll need some diagnostic gear from Enterprise. Why
don't you come along? (to Liana) I could buy you lunch.
KUULAN: Thank you, Commander, but we still have a lot to do here.
TUCKER: You've been marooned for three years. A change of scenery for
an hour or two couldn't hurt.
KUULAN: Another time.
TUCKER: Okay. I'll be back before you know it. (Tucker and T'Pol leave.)
LIANA: Why can't I go?
EZRAL: You know why.
LIANA: What's wrong with seeing their ship, meeting some of their crew?
EZRAL: I think you've met enough of their crew already.
LIANA: These are good people. They want to help us. I promise not to
say anything.
 [Situation room]
 REED: Here. (Reed points to an area on the table display.)
REED: This is where they say their engines were hit.
ARCHER: There's a lot of damage.
REED: Impact damage, sir. No scorch marks, no melting. No indications
of any weapons fire.
ARCHER: Maybe they were hit by some kind of weapon we're not familiar
with.
REED: It's possible. They also say they haven't sent out a distress
call because it'd give away their position.
ARCHER: You're not buying that, either.
REED: They crashed three years ago, sir. Whoever attacked them has to
be gone by now. Why are they still hiding?
ARCHER: Just because they're a little skittish doesn't mean they're up
to something.
REED: There's also their airponics bay.
ARCHER: What about it?
TRAVIS: It's not big enough to feed all the people on that ship, sir.
Not by a long shot.
REED: How are they surviving down there? It doesn't make any sense.
ARCHER: Do we still have their data module?
TRAVIS: It's in shuttlepod one.
ARCHER: Have Hoshi download it. Let me know as soon as she has
anything.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
 [Engineering]
 (Walking along the upper gantry)
LIANA: How many people are on Enterprise?
TUCKER: Eighty three.
LIANA: All humans?
TUCKER: Mostly. You met T'Pol. She's a Vulcan. And Doctor Phlox is from
a planet called Denobula.
LIANA: Can I meet him?
TUCKER: Are you kidding? I'd never hear the end of it if I didn't
introduce you. And there's Porthos, Captain Archer's dog.
LIANA: Dog?
(They get into a lift. It's a small space for two so they're almost
touching and she's beaming.)
TUCKER: Oh, I guess you don't have a word for that. He's a mammal. Four
legs, big ears, kind of cute.
LIANA: What does he do?
TUCKER: Not much. He's the Captain's pet.
LIANA: Of course, his pet. I've never seen a dog before. Can we see it?
(They get out of the lift)
TUCKER: Well, I hope you'll have some time left for me.
LIANA: I don't know. It sounds like I'm going to be very busy.
TUCKER: (opens door) So, tell me about Kantare.
 [Corridor]
 (The conversation continues uninterrupted.)
LIANA: Oh, it's boring. I want to hear about the places you've been.
TUCKER: Our mission's really just getting started. We haven't been to
many planets yet.
LIANA: Where are you going next?
TUCKER: No idea. That's the fun part.
LIANA: Which planet was your favourite?
TUCKER: If I had choose right now, I'd say this one.
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: Go ahead.
ARCHER [OC]: Could you come to my ready room?
TUCKER: On my way. (to stocky, shaven-headed man) Billy, could you
continue this lady's tour? I still owe you lunch. I'll meet you in the
mess hall.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: I hear you've been spending a lot of time
with Liana.
TUCKER: Did T'Pol say something? Sir, I swear I've been nothing but a
perfect gentleman.
ARCHER: I'm sure you have, Trip. This doesn't have anything to do with
that.
TUCKER: Oh.
ARCHER: We were wondering if you'd noticed any strange behaviour from
her or any of the others.
TUCKER: Strange behaviour? What's going on?
REED: Hoshi translated the data module we found on their ship, and we
were able to reconstruct what happened right before they crashed.
TUCKER: They already told us what happened.
ARCHER: According to this, they weren't attacked. There was an accident
on board.
TUCKER: What kind of an accident?
REED: There are some gaps in the data, but it looks like some kind of
catastrophic malfunction. There was a massive depressurization when the
ship went down.
TUCKER: Maybe that data module was damaged during the crash.
ARCHER: It's not just the data module.
REED: When their story didn't check out the Captain asked me to run
some detailed scans of the ship. According to the oxidation rate in the
hull plating that ship's been sitting down there a lot longer than
three years.
ARCHER: It went down nearly twenty two years ago, Trip. (Tucker looks at Reed's PADD.)
TUCKER: That doesn't make any sense.
REED: Check the scans yourself.
TUCKER: Why wouldn't Liana have told me?
REED: The data also shows that they launched a number of escape pods
just before the crash.
ARCHER: Malcolm found one. It was still in orbit. We're bringing it on
board.
 [Launch bay]
 PHLOX: This is obviously someone's final resting
place. What do you expect to accomplish by opening it?
ARCHER: I'm not quite sure.
(They open the front of the small pod, and the mummified remains of a
male in a blue overall are inside.)
PHLOX: I don't believe you'll be needing my services.
TUCKER: It's Shilat, Captain. I saw him on their ship an hour ago.
Alive. (Meanwhile, T'Pol is working at a display in the alien computer core, and using her
scanner to translate some interesting text. She leaves)
 [Mess hall]
 (Liana is sitting on her own at a table, eating
ice-cream.)
TUCKER: Vanilla, huh?
LIANA: There are different kinds?
TUCKER: Oh, hundreds. I like Rocky Road.
LIANA: That sounds terrible. Why do they call it that?
TUCKER: I never really thought about it. I guess because it's got nuts
in it. It's also got marshmallows but I don't think that's got anything
to do with the name.
LIANA: Marshmallows?
TUCKER: They're little, er. They're made of sugar, mostly. You know,
I'm not sure what they are. Anyway, did you enjoy the tour?
LIANA: Very much. I think Sickbay was my favourite. Doctor Phlox let me
feed his bat. He also asked me to lunch. Had I known you were going to
be gone so long.
TUCKER: I'm sorry. Something important came up.
LIANA: What's wrong?
TUCKER: Liana, how long have you been on this planet?
LIANA: Captain Kuulan told you.
TUCKER: I want you to tell me.
LIANA: Why?
TUCKER: Because our scans show your ship crashed twenty two years ago.
LIANA: Well, your scans must be wrong.
TUCKER: That's what I told Captain Archer. I said there wasn't any
reason for you to lie to us. Is there? (silence) We found one of your
escape pods.
LIANA: I think I should go now.
TUCKER: Liana.
LIANA: Take me back.
TUCKER: There was a body in it. Been dead for a long time. It was
Shilat. Can you explain that to me?
LIANA: I can't.
TUCKER: Tell me what's going on.
LIANA: I'm sorry, but I can't. Please take me home.
 [Alien ship]
 (T'Pol is exploring an uninhabited and damaged
part of the ship when suddenly she meet a young man in a blue and red top, and very much alive).)
SHILAT: Do you need
some help?
T'POL: Not at all.
SHILAT: I thought you were repairing the optronic relays.
T'POL: I've done as much as I can do for now. I need to return to
Enterprise to analyse the data. If you'll excuse me.
(She turns around to find more crewmembers behind her.)
KUULAN: Do you need some help?
T'POL: I need to contact my ship.
KUULAN: Because of what you found?
T'POL: I don't understand.
KUULAN: You were looking where you shouldn't have.
 [Alien ship]
 (The shuttlepod has landed, and Archer, Reed,
Liana and Trip have entered the alien ship.)
ARCHER: Find T'Pol. I'm going to go talk to the captain.
REED: I think it would be better if we stay together, sir.
LIANA: You don't have to do this. You're not in any danger here.
ARCHER: That'd be easier to believe if you weren't hiding things from
us.
LIANA: Can't you just fix our systems and go?
TUCKER: Is that what you really want? How old were you when your ship
crashed. Five, six? Do you even remember what your home looks like?
LIANA: This is my home.
KUULAN: Liana.
LIANA: I didn't tell them anything.
ARCHER: No, she didn't, but if you want any more help from us we're
going to need some answers.
SHILAT: We don't owe you answers.
KUULAN: Take their weapons.
LIANA: Please, just let them leave. That's what you wanted in the first
place.
KUULAN: When the repairs are completed. (Trip is marched away at gunpoint.)
LIANA: (to Ezral) Make him stop.
He'll listen to you.
KUULAN: Go back to your ship.
ARCHER: Not without my officers.
KUULAN: This isn't a negotiation. (Archer and Reed leave.)
EZRAL: Liana.
 [Alien computer core]
 SHILAT: Get to work.
TUCKER: Where's T'Pol?
EZRAL: Don't worry about her.
TUCKER: I'm going to need her help.
EZRAL: You can do it on your own.
TUCKER: I'm not doing a thing until I see her.
EZRAL: Do as I say or you'll never see her.
TUCKER: What's so important about this thing? You'd really kill us to
keep it running?
EZRAL: You wouldn't understand.
TUCKER: I don't care what your big secret is. It doesn't matter if
you've been here three years or thirty. But you've got to think about
Liana. We can help you take her home.
EZRAL: Just fix those relays.
TUCKER: You got a lot to learn about making friends.
EZRAL: I've made all the friends I need.
 [Airponics]
 LIANA: I'm sick of hearing that he's doing this
for me. I don't believe it anymore.
MAYA: I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for your father.
LIANA: He still should have told them the truth.
MAYA: You know he can't do that.
LIANA: He can do whatever he wants. He's not like you.
MAYA: You shouldn't have gone to their ship.
LIANA: You think this is my fault?
MAYA: I saw the way you looked at their engineer. Are you sure you
didn't say anything?
LIANA: No, I didn't.
MAYA: They'll be gone soon and everything will be fine again.
 [Launch bay]
 ARCHER: We'll set the shuttle down in the
foothills south of their ship.
TRAVIS: Won't they pick us up on sensors?
ARCHER: Their dampening field should leave them as blind as we are.
REED: Unfortunately, that rules out using the transporter as well. (The security team board the pod.)
ARCHER: We'll go in through their
escape pod ports. That should put us near Engineering and their
computer room.
REED: And with a bit of luck, near T'Pol and Commander Tucker.
 [Alien computer core]
 TUCKER: That's a pretty neat trick. Here you are
watching me with a gun in your hand while at the same time your corpse
is up on the Enterprise. What do you do for an encore?
LIANA: (to Shilat, as she enters) Would you wait outside?
SHILAT: I'm not supposed to leave him.
LIANA: It's all right. (Shilat leaves, Liana shuts the door.) LIANA: They do what I
ask them to.
TUCKER: Then why don't you ask them to let me go?
LIANA: I wish I could.
TUCKER: Maybe you could tell me how I'm being guarded by a dead man.
LIANA: Do you think it's possible to tell a lie so many times that you
begin to believe it's the truth? You can. I never really understood
that until you came. Remember when you said you thought we were ghosts?
In a way, you were right.
 [Alien ship]
 (The rescue team have made it onboard and are
moving along by flashlight.)
ARCHER: Work your way down the port side. Comm. us if you find T'Pol,
and be careful.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
(Archer and Reed turn right. Further on, Reed is shot in the back,
Archer drags him behind a container but his return fire goes straight
through their attacker. They retreat.)
 [Alien computer core]
 TUCKER: That's why your father needs to keep this
running.
LIANA: Yes. (They hear weapons fire.)
TUCKER: You can stop this.
 [Alien ship]
 ARCHER: You all right?
REED: Yeah. Where did he come from?
ARCHER: Good question.
EZRAL: (to Kuulan) You have to get them off the ship.
(Archer and Reed take cover at a dead end, but their shots still pass
through their attacker's body)
 [Alien computer core]
 TUCKER: Liana, please. If you don't, my friends
could die. Please. (Meanwhile, Shilat walks through a wall and tackles Reed,
Archer pulls him off. Liana removes two control chips from the console
and the aliens disappear, their weapons falling to the floor, except
for one man.)
 [Alien cargo area]
 ARCHER: What happened to your crew?
EZRAL: They're gone, Captain. Isn't it obvious?
ARCHER: Your real crew.
EZRAL: Oh. They didn't seem real to you? I created them. Wasn't easy.
Took time. You could touch them. They could make you laugh, surprise
you.
TUCKER: They were holograms.
EZRAL: They were our friends, our family for over twenty years.
LIANA: They're the only people I've ever known, besides my father,
until you've came.
ARCHER: But the ones you based them on, the crew of this ship, where
are they?
EZRAL: I buried them out in the hills, the ones I could find after the
crash. I killed them, so I buried them.
LIANA: That isn't true.
EZRAL: You don't remember. You were a child. We were on our way home,
just like Kuulan told you, but we weren't attacked. There was an ion
storm. It overloaded our plasma conduits. I was the chief engineer. It
was my responsibility to start repairs. But it was worse than I
thought. Leaking plasma burned through the hull. We were losing
atmosphere so Captain Kuulan set a course for this planet.
ARCHER: Sounds like you did everything you could to save the ship.
EZRAL: They're all dead. Apparently, I didn't do enough.
LIANA: They died because of me.
EZRAL: No. It was my decision. She was in our quarters on the lowest
deck. I knew she'd never survive a crash landing down there, so I went
to get her.
ARCHER: Any father would have done the same thing.
EZRAL: I left my station. The plasma leak grew, there was an explosion.
Half the crew died instantly including my wife. A few made it to the
escape pods, but.
ARCHER: I can't imagine what making that decision must have been like,
but it was a long time ago. You need to consider your daughter now.
EZRAL: Why do you think I did this? To retreat into some fantasy?
Pretend it never happened? For two years I tried to repair our ship,
and I watched my daughter grow up alone. So I decided to bring them
back. Her mother first, then Captain Kuulan and the others. I did
everything I could to make it like it was, for her.
TUCKER: She deserves more.
EZRAL: I've given her everything she needs.
TUCKER: And when you're gone?
LIANA: Trip, please.
TUCKER: Are you going to let her bury you out in the hills, and live
the rest of her life with these people you created? What if the relays
burn out again? Then she'll really be alone.
EZRAL: She's my daughter. It's not your concern.
TUCKER: What if she gets hurt? What do you do then? Programme a
holographic doctor?
EZRAL: We've survived here successfully.
TUCKER: Maybe you have. Ask Liana how she feels. Ask her if just
surviving is enough.
(Enter Travis and T'Pol.)
ARCHER: (to T'Pol) You all right? We'll finish working on your
holographic systems, if that's what you want. But you should be sure
that's all the help you need from us. It may be a long time before
anyone comes by here again.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in. (Ezral enters) Welcome aboard.
EZRAL: Thank you, Captain. You have a beautiful ship.
ARCHER: Thanks. We're pretty proud of her.
EZRAL: May I sit?
ARCHER: Of course.
EZRAL: I haven't been in space for a long time. It feels strange. Good,
just a bit strange.
ARCHER: Can I get you something? Some tea?
EZRAL: I'm fine. No, I'm not. Your engineer is a very plain-spoken man.
ARCHER: That's one way of putting it.
EZRAL: I've never kept secrets from my daughter. She knows there's more
to see beyond our little oasis. But she's never talked about leaving.
Not once. Now your engineer thinks we should just pack up and go.
Twenty two years, Captain. I've lived here for twenty two years, and
that ship down there may seem like nothing more than spare parts to
you, but to me it's home. I don't want to leave. I am happy here.
Comfortable. But Mister Tucker wants me to believe that I'm being
selfish. He says that now that I have the opportunity to leave, I
should. That Liana deserves more. Maybe it's time I stopped being so
afraid of change. Will you help me take my daughter home?
ARCHER: We'll stay as long as it takes to get your ship flying.
EZRAL: Thank you, Captain, but all we need are these components. I've
got my own crew to do the work some of them are pretty fair engineers.
I saw to that.
 [Alien cargo hold]
 (The holo-crew are moving stuff around.)
TUCKER: How's it going?
LIANA: Good. We're about to start realigning the antimatter injectors.
TUCKER: That was fast.
LIANA: What's that?
TUCKER: It's a protein resequencer. I figured you must be tired of
eating the same food all the time. I programmed it for making
ice-cream. Only five flavours, but they're good ones.
LIANA: Rocky Road?
TUCKER: You didn't think I'd send you off without Rocky Road.
LIANA: Thank you.
TUCKER: Are you sure you don't want us to stay for a while, lend a
hand?
LIANA: You've got a lot more places to go.
TUCKER: So do you. (Liana kisses him.) TUCKER: Maybe I'll see you out there.
LIANA: I'd like that.

  [Cell]
 (Light streams in through roof windows onto Travis
and Archer, who are lying on blankets on a hard floor.)
TRAVIS: Captain? Sir? (No response, so Travis gets to his feet wearily and
looks around. The door is unlocked, so he opens it to see a pair of
Suliban walking by. When the coast is clear, he goes exploring. Later -)
ARCHER: How many?
TRAVIS: I saw at least thirty. This place is pretty big. There could be
more.
ARCHER: Any idea who attacked the shuttle?
TRAVIS: I didn't exactly have time to get a good look. (Archer finally gets to his feet.)
ARCHER: The energy readings we got from
the other side of that moon could have come from a Helix. (Archer gives Travis
a leg up to look through a window.)
TRAVIS: There's a wall about five metres high. It's looks like it
surrounds this entire building. I see something that might be a guard
tower but I can't be sure.
ARCHER: Any people?
TRAVIS: No, sir. (He gets down.)
ARCHER: You up for another walk?
 [Compound corridor]
(Suliban look like they have pale yellow
porridge for skin.)  WOMAN: You're the new arrivals.
ARCHER: Why are we here?
WOMAN: Why are any of us here? (A siren goes off, other Suliban come
out of their rooms and stand still. In the open area, four military
looking men walk around the Suliban there, until one drops his cup.
When he bends to pick it up, the leader zaps his hand with his stick
and moves on.)
KLEV: (to Archer and Travis) Follow me.
 [Grat's office]
 (These military look almost entirely human except
for a small detail between the eyebrows.)
GRAT: Thank you, Major. Please, sit down. (They remain standing.) GRAT: I can
understand why you're upset. No doubt you've had a difficult afternoon.
ARCHER: To say the least.
GRAT: I meant to speak to you earlier, but I had some urgent business
to attend to. I apologise. We don't see many starship captains here.
(reading from a PADD) Jonathan Archer.
ARCHER: That's right.
GRAT: You must be Travis Mayweather.
TRAVIS: And you are?
GRAT: I am Colonel Grat.
ARCHER: I take it you're the man in charge.
GRAT: I took the liberty to examine the database in your shuttlecraft,
so I know that you're from a planet called Earth and that you serve on
a vessel called Enterprise. What I don't know is what you were doing
within our military zone.
ARCHER: Military zone?
GRAT: You entered orbit of our second moon. You must have detected it.
ARCHER: We picked up some unusual energy readings but we had no idea
where they were coming from. We were simply curious.
GRAT: Your curiosity almost got you killed. Fortunately, our patrol
ship didn't vaporise your shuttlecraft.
ARCHER: You might think about putting up a 'no trespassing' sign.
GRAT: I'll pass that along.
ARCHER: Where are we now?
GRAT: This is a detention complex. It's several light years from where
we found you.
TRAVIS: Does everyone that violates your territory get thrown into a
place like this?
GRAT: We're at war with a species that can mimic the appearance of
almost any humanoid. We had to make certain that you weren't
infiltrators.
TRAVIS: If you're worried we're Suliban, trust me, we're not.
GRAT: I know. We've already tested your DNA. You're familiar with the
Cabal?
ARCHER: (sitting) Unfortunately.
GRAT: Then you must know about their genetic enhancements and how
dangerous they can be.
ARCHER: Firsthand.
GRAT: I hope you didn't suffer too many casualties.
ARCHER: We've been lucky so far. We're eager to get back to Enterprise.
If you'll take us to our shuttlepod, we'll be on our way.
GRAT: I'm afraid I don't have the authority to release you. We have
very strict regulations. You'll have to appear before a magistrate on
Tandar Prime. But the hearing should be brief. I'll explain that this
was just an innocent misunderstanding.
ARCHER: When's this hearing?
GRAT: A transport will be here in three days.
TRAVIS: Three days?
GRAT: I wish I could offer you more comfortable accommodations.
Unfortunately, this detention complex is overcrowded at the moment. I
would advise you to keep to yourselves. If the Suliban give you any
trouble, simply tell one of the guards.
ARCHER: I'd like to contact my ship, let them know we're all right.
GRAT: I can't permit that, Captain.
ARCHER: Regulations?
GRAT: But I will call them personally and explain the situation.
(He buzzes and Klev reappears.) GRAT: Escort these gentlemen back to their
quarters. Make sure they get a proper meal. I'm sorry we couldn't have
met under better circumstances.
ARCHER: So am I.
 [Cell]
 (It's night, and they have blankets over their
shoulders for warmth. Travis is stirring a bowl of porridge in disdain.)
TRAVIS: They call this a proper meal? I should save it for Commander
Tucker. It'd make a good valve sealant.
ARCHER: (eating heartily) Why don't you get some sleep. I'll take the
first watch.
TRAVIS: (pouring water) This thing doesn't hold much.
ARCHER: I'll be right back.
 [Common area]
 (A Suliban barges in just as Archer is about to
get more water.)
ARCHER: How about waiting your turn? (No reply. He sees a child helping
gather up the washing from lines.) ARCHER: I can't believe you'd do this to a
child.
DANIK: Do what?
ARCHER: She's a little young to be a member of the Cabal.
DANIK: You don't know what you're talking about.
ARCHER: I know that you're given genetic tricks as payment. What are
they giving her? (The siren sounds.)
DANIK: I don't know who you are, but you're wrong about us.
ARCHER: Is that so?
DANIK: We're not genetically enhanced and we're not members of the
Cabal.
ARCHER: If that's true, then what are you doing here?
DANIK: Didn't Colonel Grat tell you? We're dangerous. All Suliban are
dangerous.
KLEV: It's past curfew.
DANIK: We were just on our way back.
KLEV: Sorry, Danik. It's the second time this week.
DANIK: Klev, please.
KLEV: It's only for one night.
ARCHER: It's my fault. I'm the one who kept them here.
KLEV: Get back to your cell.
ARCHER: Where are you taking him?
KLEV: Isolation. Unless you want to join him, do as I say.
DANIK: Will you make sure she gets back? (guard nods) I'll see you in
the morning. (kisses girl) Don't worry.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: I'd like to speak with them.
GRAT [on viewscreen]: I'm sorry, but regulations forbid that. There's
nothing to be concerned about. They've been placed in comfortable
quarters and they're perfectly safe.
TUCKER: If it's all the same to you, I'd rather hear that from the
Captain.
GRAT [on viewscreen]: I'm afraid that's not possible.
T'POL: May we attend the hearing?
GRAT [on viewscreen]: Of course.
T'POL: Will they be given legal representation?
GRAT [on viewscreen]: They're also free to choose their own counsel.
When you arrive at Tandar Prime you'll be contacted by the Central
Magistrate's Office.
T'POL: We'll need the coordinates.
GRAT [on viewscreen]: I'm sending them now.
T'POL: Thank you, Colonel.
GRAT [on viewscreen]: Good luck to you. (Ends transmission.)
REED: Hoshi?
HOSHI: I can't trace the signal. He must have scrambled the carrier
wave.
TUCKER: Keep at it.
T'POL: What are you suggesting we do, mount a rescue?
TUCKER: The thought crossed my mind.
T'POL: It would be a mistake to provoke the Tandarans any further.
TUCKER: So, we just sit on our hands.
T'POL: The hearing's in three days.
TUCKER: And what if they're found guilty, sentenced to thirty years in
prison?
T'POL: That's unlikely. If you want to explore alien cultures you'll
need to learn to respect their laws. If Captain Archer were here, I'm
sure he'd agree. If you'd like, I'll contact the Vulcan High Command.
They might be willing to send an arbitrator.
TUCKER: A Vulcan lawyer? They'd be better off getting the electric
chair.
T'POL: Electric chair?
TUCKER: Never mind.
T'POL: Set a course for Tandar Prime.
 [Common area]
 (It's a bright sunny day, and the children are
painting murals on the wall. Archer spots Danik playing a game with two
other Suliban.)
ARCHER: Hello again. (the two leave) I hope isolation wasn't too rough.
DANIK: It gets very cold in there at night. Sometimes I wish I was
genetically enhanced. If you've come to apologize, don't. It was just a
misunderstanding.
ARCHER: Actually, I was hoping to find out what's going on around here.
DANIK: Maybe you should talk to one of the Tandarans.
ARCHER: I spoke to Colonel Grat, but I get the feeling he's not telling
me the whole story. Archer. My name is Jonathan Archer. (He introduces
Danik to the concept of the handshake.)
 [Danik's cell]
 (Later, they're eating together.)
NARRA: More?
TRAVIS: I've had plenty, thank you. It was very good.
NARRA: You look like Tandarans.
DANIK: Why don't you go and find your friends? And don't forget curfew.
NARRA: I won't. (Narra leaves.)
DANIK: We're not criminals, Captain, and we're not soldiers. The only
thing we're guilty of is being Suliban.
ARCHER: They must have tested your DNA, figured out that you haven't
been genetically altered.
DANIK: As far as they're concerned, that doesn't mean anything. You
believed I was a member of the Cabal, didn't you? Didn't you?
ARCHER: Yes, I did.
DANIK: All that seems to matter is the way we look. 'Be careful of
their wicked smiles, their shining yellow eyes. At night, they'll
squeeze right through your door and everybody dies.' The Tandaran
children used to tease my daughter with that nursery rhyme. At least
here, she doesn't have to hear it anymore.
ARCHER: This is an internment camp.
DANIK: (clearing the plates) Detention Complex twenty six. I've heard
it's one of their nicer ones.
ARCHER: Why did this happen?
DANIK: The Cabal began their attacks eight years ago. It wasn't long
before the Tandarans started to question the loyalty of all Suliban
living in their territory. We were rounded up, relocated as they like
to say. They told us it was only temporary. It was for our own safety.
'Once the Cabal has been destroyed, you will be free to go back to your
homes.' We're still waiting. There are eighty nine of us here.
Thousands more in other camps. Everyone of us used to be citizens on
worlds in the Tandar Sector. Did you know that I was born in the same
town as one of the guards? Major Klev. I was friends with his brother
when we were growing up.
TRAVIS: What about the government on the Suliban homeworld? Don't they
have something to say about this?
DANIK: I'm sure they would if they still existed. Our homeworld became
uninhabitable three hundred years ago. Most Suliban are nomadic, but
some of us have assimilated into other cultures. My grandfather made
the unfortunate decision to settle on Tandar Prime. (knock on door)
Yes?
SAJEN: What are they doing here?
DANIK: It's all right. I asked them.
SAJEN: This came today. (hands over a letter) What species are you?
ARCHER: We're human.
SAJEN: Never heard of them.
DANIK: Sajen, you're being rude.
ARCHER: Bad news?
DANIK: It's my wife. We were separated during the relocation. She's in
one of the other camps. Her transfer was rejected again. She tried to
appeal their decision, but as usual, they wouldn't listen.
ARCHER: I'm sorry. (The siren goes off.)
DANIK: Midday inspection. Try to look your best.
ARCHER: Thank you for lunch.
DANIK: Thank you for listening. (Travis and Archer leave)
SAJEN: Why did you bring them here?
DANIK: Maybe I was tired of talking to you.
SAJEN: They could be working with Grat.
 [Common area]
 (Klev is doing a head count, and roughly shoves
the little girl to one side.)
ARCHER: Hey!
KLEV: Colonel Grat wants to see you. (Travis moves to follow Archer and
gets stopped.) KLEV: Just him.
 [Grat's office]
 GRAT: I understand you were out after curfew last
night, arguing with a Suliban.
ARCHER: It was just a misunderstanding.
GRAT: You should have my advice, Captain.
ARCHER: I know, I know. it's a big problem with me. I'm just too damn
curious. Whenever I meet new people I can't resist trying to get to
know them. I'm certainly getting to know a lot about the Suliban around
here.
GRAT: I admire your spirit of exploration, but in this case it could
get you into trouble. Keep to yourself.
ARCHER: I'll do my best. Unless you have any more advice? (stands)
GRAT: No, but I do have a question. Have you ever been to Oklahoma? I
guess you could say I'm a curious man myself. After you mentioned that
you were familiar with the Cabal I decided to speak with our
intelligence agency. They've uncovered some interesting facts.
Apparently two Suliban soldiers crash-landed near a town called Broken
Bow, Oklahoma. They were chasing a Klingon, of all things. I was
wondering if you could provide some insight into what they were doing
there.
ARCHER: I wouldn't know. You'd have to talk to my superiors.
GRAT: Oh, I think you know a great deal. Enterprise took the Klingon
back to his homeworld. Isn't that right? Rigel Ten. You made a detour
there. From what I'm told, you contacted a woman named Sarin. You
remember her? Well, I'll remind you. She was the head of a Suliban
resistance cell. She was killed by the Cabal in a firefight at the
trade complex. Several of our people saw you there, Captain. I believe
you were injured, a shot in the leg. Do I have to ask your superiors
about that as well?
ARCHER: What exactly do you want?
GRAT: Information. What do you know about the Cabal? What genetic
enhancements you've seen, Helix deployments. Who's giving them their
orders?
ARCHER: You've got plenty of Suliban here. Why not ask them?
GRAT: We both know they wouldn't be very helpful.
ARCHER: Then why are they in prison?
GRAT: That's a discussion for another time.
ARCHER: There are families here, children. One man hasn't seen his wife
in years.
GRAT: Tell me what you know.
ARCHER: They don't deserve this kind of treatment.
GRAT: They're here for their own protection.
ARCHER: Oh, really?
GRAT: The last thing we wanted to do was build these detention centres,
but we had no choice. When the Cabal began their activities there was a
great deal of fear among the Tandarans. There were instances of
violence. Fourteen innocent Suliban were killed in one day alone. We
had to find a way to keep them out of danger.
ARCHER: Then why not just let them find another place to live?
GRAT: They wouldn't get very far. It's ironic, but once they're out of
Tandaran territory the Cabal will hunt them down and turn them all into
soldiers. They're better off here.
ARCHER: I've met a few Suliban who disagree.
GRAT: One of the Cabal leaders is a man named Silik. He infiltrated
your vessel approximately three months ago posing as a Borothan
pilgrim. What did he want? Did he speak of the Temporal Cold War?
Answer me! (Silence, so he summons Klev.) GRAT: This conversation is taking
longer than I expected. I'd hate to see you miss that transport
tomorrow morning. The next one won't arrive for another sixty days.
 [Bridge]
 GRAT [on viewscreen]: I'm afraid the hearing's
been postponed.
T'POL: Why?
GRAT [on viewscreen]: The magistrate assigned to their case is in the
middle of a very complex proceeding and it's taking more time than he
expected.
TUCKER: (while Reed works at his console) How much longer are they
going to have to wait?
GRAT [on viewscreen]: Hopefully not more than a few days. If you stay
on course for Tandar Prime I'll arrange for an ambassador to show you
our capital city when you arrive.
TUCKER: We're not interested in a tour. We just want our people back.
GRAT [on viewscreen]: I'm doing everything I can. Try to be patient.
You'll hear from me soon. (Ends transmission.)
REED: I've isolated their carrier frequency. Do you see it?
HOSHI: I'm tracing it now. Bearing one seven eight mark twelve.
TUCKER: How far?
REED: Five point two light years.
TUCKER: All I'm saying is we go take a look for ourselves, make sure
they're okay.
T'POL: Proceed.
 [Compound corridor]
 ARCHER: Most of the people we meet have been
pretty eager to get to know us but we've had our share of unfortunate
encounters. I guess you could say this is one of them.
DANIK: I've lived with Tandarans all my life. They're decent people,
for the most part.
ARCHER: What about you? What did you do before you ended up here?
DANIK: I was director of research at an engineering institute. It's in
the Querella Province. You should see it, assuming your hearing goes
well.
ARCHER: I've got a feeling we could be here for awhile.
DANIK: Why not tell Grat what you know, get yourself out of here.
ARCHER: I don't like being strong-armed, and I don't like what he's
doing to you and the others. Has anyone every tried to get out of here?
DANIK: You mean escape? A couple of years ago three men pried open one
of the security grates. They tried to get to the docking bay.
ARCHER: Docking bay?
DANIK: Yes. It's about a hundred metres away. It's where they keep
Suliban ships they've impounded.
ARCHER: What happened?
DANIK: Oh, they managed to get inside but before they could reach a
vessel all three of them were killed. Colonel Grat made a ridiculous
claim that they were armed.
ARCHER: They might have succeeded with a little help from the outside.
It won't be long before Enterprise comes looking for Mayweather and me.
DANIK: I appreciate the offer, Captain, but I doubt many people here
would be willing to take the risk.
ARCHER: Have you asked them? How many ships are in that docking bay?
 [Common area]
 (Travis gets himself a drink and then spots Sajen
at a table. He's left-handed.)
TRAVIS: Writing a letter?
SAJEN: It's a journal.
TRAVIS: Could be valuable someday. People will want to know what
happened here.
SAJEN: I doubt anyone will ever read this.
TRAVIS: Then why are you writing it?
SAJEN: Why do you care? I see how you look at us. Suliban terrify you.
You wouldn't be surprised if I slithered up this wall or turned my face
inside out. Cabal, Suliban, it's all the same to you.
TRAVIS: That's not true.
 [Cell]
 (While Travis sleeps, Archer is studying a plan of
the centre when a communicator materialises on the floor beside him.)
ARCHER: What took you so long?
T'POL [OC]: Are you all right?
ARCHER: More or less.
T'POL [OC]: We're picking up
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Suliban bio-signs.
ARCHER [OC]: It's not what you think. Are you sure this is a secure
frequency?
HOSHI: I'm triaxilating the signal, sir. If we were in the middle of
Starfleet headquarters no one would pick it up.
ARCHER [OC]: Good. Where are you?
T'POL: In orbit. It won't be long before we're detected.
TUCKER: I'm getting a transporter lock on you now, Captain.
 [Cell]
 (Travis is awake too now.)
TUCKER [OC]: Just say the word and we'll bring you both home.
ARCHER: Hang on, Trip. We're not ready to leave just yet.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: Those Suliban you detected are
prisoners too, but they're no more guilty than we are.
 [Cell]
 ARCHER: I want to help them get out of here.
T'POL [OC]: Captain?
ARCHER: Have you ever heard of Manzanar, Sub-Commander?
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: I'm not familiar with that planet.
ARCHER: It's not a planet. It was an internment camp
 [Cell]
 ARCHER: On Earth during the Second World War.
Japanese-American citizens were imprisoned there even though they
didn't do anything wrong. The same thing's happening here.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: I thought you decided not to interfere with
other cultures.
 [Cell]
 ARCHER: In this case, I'm making an exception.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: Understood?
T'POL: Yes, Captain.
 [Cell]
 ARCHER: I've met a Suliban who knows this camp
inside and out. We've been working on a plan but we're going to need
your help.
 [Danik's cell]
 (Studying the compound plan.)
ARCHER: We'll need a few of your people. Anyone who's had experience
with particle weapons.
SAJEN: We won't make it ten metres outside the complex before we're
shot, like the others.
DANIK: And even if we did get to the ships and managed to lift off,
there are patrol vessels in the area.
ARCHER: Enterprise can handle them.
SAJEN: And once we've made this miraculous escape, where do you expect
us to go?
DANIK: All we have to do is get out of Tandaran territory. After that,
we can set a course for the Niburon colonies. I know some people there.
They might be willing to help us.
SAJEN: It's too dangerous.
TRAVIS: Would you rather spend the rest of your life in prison?
SAJEN: You're placing a lot of trust in people you've only known for
three days. For all we know they've been planted here to stage this
revolt so Grat would finally have a reason to kill all of us.
ARCHER: We're not working for the Tandarans.
SAJEN: Think of your daughter. Are you willing to risk her life, too?
DANIK: We're getting out of here, Sajen.
SAJEN: I'm not going to help you plan our suicide. (leaves)
ARCHER: I hope the others were more enthusiastic.
DANIK: (referring to plan) This is the wall that I was telling you
about. It's only forty metres from the docking bay.
 [Grat's office]
 GRAT: Have you had a chance to reconsider? I'm
willing to compromise, Captain. Just tell me what you know about Silik.
ARCHER: Well, he's about this tall, a little on the scrawny side, bad
teeth.
GRAT: If you're unwilling to discuss the Suliban, maybe you can help me
with something else. We detected some unusual energy readings last
night. At first we thought it was random interference, but after
examining the readings more closely we discovered they were coming from
your quarters.
ARCHER: You should check your sensors. They're obviously
malfunctioning.
GRAT: I'm told they're working perfectly. (He summons Klev, who has a
guard holding onto Travis. He's been beaten.)
TRAVIS: Sorry, Captain.
GRAT: (holding communicator) We found this in Ensign Mayweather's
pocket but he wouldn't say how it got there. (Archer approaches Grat,
so Klev zaps him in the back) I was hoping you could tell me. (silence)
Take him to isolation.
 [Situation room]
 (Tucker points at orbital image of the area.)
TUCKER: If I come in low from the east I should be able to evade their
proximity sensors.
T'POL: This appears to be a pulse cannon.
TUCKER: It'll be my first target.
T'POL: Bridge to Sickbay.
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox is doing something with red light.)  PHLOX: Phlox
here.
T'POL: What's your status?
PHLOX: Finishing as we speak, though I'm not completely happy with the
nose.
 [Situation room]
 T'POL: It's almost time.
PHLOX [OC]: Understood.
HOSHI: It's Captain Archer.
T'POL: (walking forward onto Bridge proper) Put him through. Go ahead,
Captain.
GRAT [OC]: You seem to be off-course. I thought you were headed for
Tandar Prime. What brings you here?
T'POL: Where's Captain Archer?
 [Grat's office]
 GRAT: If you're thinking about trying to
circumvent our legal system I advise against it.
 [Bridge]
 GRAT [OC]: You come any closer to our planet and
my patrol ships will open fire.
 [Common area]
 (Travis is bathing his bloodied face.)
SAJEN: What happened to you?
TRAVIS: What do you care.
SAJEN: Danik's been looking for your Captain. Have you seen him?
TRAVIS: You might try isolation. Still think we're working with the
Tandarans? You know, we could have left this place a long time ago if
we hadn't decided to help you.
SAJEN: I never asked for your help.
TRAVIS: Why? Because we're not Suliban? Because we look a little too
much like Tandarans? I'll admit, when I first came here it wasn't easy
to see past my preconceptions about the Suliban, but I did. Why can't
you?
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: We're being hailed. It's him.
GRAT [on viewscreen: Check your sensors and you'll see two patrol ships
headed toward you.
T'POL: We didn't come here to fight. We came to talk with you.
GRAT [on viewscreen]: They'll have a weapons lock on your vessel in
less than one minute.
T'POL: Do you eat meat, Colonel?
GRAT [on viewscreen]: What?
T'POL: Our chef is preparing a meal in your honour, and I was curious
whether you're vegetarian. I was hoping you'd join me for dinner. It
would give us an opportunity to get acquainted.
GRAT [on viewscreen]: You have forty five seconds to leave orbit.
T'POL: I can't believe you're really going to destroy our vessel over a
trivial incident like this. I can tell you're an enlightened man. All
I'm asking for is a chance to show you that we're enlightened as well.
We're transmitting a copy of Earth's historical database along with the
Starfleet charter, and a record of all human contacts with alien
species. If you have any doubts about our intentions this material
should lay them to rest. Send him the Vulcan database as well. I think
you'll find that my people have a great deal in common with you, too.
GRAT [on viewscreen]: (the image is beginning to fracture) You're
jamming our frequencies. Break off your transmission now.
T'POL: What about dinner? Should I set a
GRAT [on viewscreen]: (barely audible) I'm not going to warn you again.
End your transmission and leave orbit.
T'POL: Mister Tucker.

 TUCKER: It's done.

 HOSHI: Those patrol ships are closing fast.
T'POL: Get us out of here.

 (Travis is eating his porridge when there's a
knock on the door. He opens it to see a Suliban.)
TRAVIS: Yes?
REED: I understand you're looking for a way out of here.
TRAVIS: Who are you?
REED: Don't you recognise me, Travis?
TRAVIS: Malcolm?
REED: In the flesh. Oh, you look worse than I do. What happened?
TRAVIS: Long story. How'd you get down here?
REED: Transporter. I think I'm finally getting used to it.
TRAVIS: Are you sure you weren't detected?
REED: No, thanks to Hoshi. She kept the sensors occupied. (Reed gets two
phase pistols out of his knapsack.) REED: Congratulations, Ensign. Your case
is about to be dismissed. (A little later - it's that map again.)
DANIK: The isolation block is here. He's in one of these cells.
REED: I'll find him.
DANIK: The charges?
TRAVIS: They're in place. Are you up for this? (Danik nods, then the siren sounds.)
DANIK: Nightly inspection.
REED: I thought you said it wasn't for another fifteen minutes.
DANIK: I'd better get back. See you in orbit.
TRAVIS: Good luck.
REED: Reed to Enterprise.
T'POL [OC]: Go ahead.
REED: The guards are ahead of schedule.
 [Bridge]
 REED [OC]: What's your status?
T'POL: We're two hundred thousand kilometres away.
REED [OC]: We're going to need you to speed things up a little.
T'POL: We'll do our best.
(In the central area, Klev and his men are checking that everyone is
present. Enterprise approaches the planet.)
HOSHI: Here they come.
T'POL: Polarise the hull plating. Stand by weapons. (The little patrol
ships open fire.) T'POL: Aft torpedoes. Fire.
HOSHI: Two direct hits. They're veering off.
T'POL: Take us down. (Enterprise descends through a cloud layer.) T'POL: Did
they follow us?
HOSHI: They took heavy damage. They're both attempting to land.
T'POL: You're clear to launch, Commander.
 [Shuttlepod]
 TUCKER: Acknowledged.
 [Cell]
 REED: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: He's approaching the compound. Two minutes.
REED: Tell him (Klev bursts in unannounced.)
KLEV: Get out there. (He zaps Reed in the
kidneys.)
 [Compound corridor]
 (They are lined up against the wall.)
KLEV: If this happens again you'll all be spending time in isolation.
TRAVIS: Major, do you have a second? I don't mean to cause any trouble,
but I was wondering if it might be possible to get some better food. No
offence, but the meals here are pretty awful.
KLEV: Eat what you're given.
TRAVIS: I'll try, but I'm not sure I can hold down another bowl of that
what do you call it? It tastes like sawdust. Is that what they make you
eat? Because if it is, I'd think about going on a hunger strike. I
don't know how you.
KLEV: Enough! (Klev marches away down the corridor with two guards. Reed
activates something and Klev spots three green flashing lights on a
wall. He moves to investigate.)
REED: Go, go. (He gets the rest of the Suliban out of the corridor before
detonating the charges and incidentally taking out Klev and his men.)
REED: Reed to Tucker. The wall's down.
 [Shuttlepod]
 TUCKER: I see it. Stand by.
(Swooping in, Trip takes out the defence weapons and guard towers.)
 [Common area]
 DANIK: Hurry. Go with the others. (He hands little
Narra over to another Suliban,)
VOICE: Hurry! Hurry! Go, go! Hurry.

container drum.)
NARRA: Father!
DANIK: I'll be there soon, Narra. Go. Go! (He tries to drag his wounded
colleague to safety.)
 [Isolation cell]
 (As Reed opens the door, Archer grabs him and
pushes him against the wall, then)
ARCHER: It's good to see you, Malcolm.
REED: How'd you know it was me? (He leaves the cell first, only to be knocked
out by -)
GRAT: You have no idea what you've done. You haven't freed these
people, you've condemned them.
 [Hole in the wall]
 (Tucker continues to shoot holes in the detention
centre, and Travis stands guard at the new exit.)
NARRA: (to Sajen) My father's back at the common area. He needs help.
Please.
TRAVIS: I'll go.
SAJEN: No, wait. (Travis gives him his phase pistol then gets the other
two out.)
TRAVIS: Come on.
 [Isolation cell]
 GRAT: You had no right to interfere.
ARCHER: This isn't about my rights. It's about theirs.
GRAT: They have no rights. They lost them the moment the Cabal began
attacking us. Do you know how many people the Cabal have murdered? How
many ships they destroyed? Colonies? You just gave them eighty nine new
soldiers!
ARCHER: What makes you think they'll join the Cabal?
GRAT: These people have nothing left. They're desperate. They'll never
be able to resist what the Cabal has to offer.
ARCHER: (seeing Reed waking up) I haven't been here very long but I
seem to know these people a hell of a lot better than you do.
(Reed rams Grat from behind and Archer gets his weapon off him. The
Colonel looks terrified, so they shut him in the cell. Four little ships take off from the space dock,
followed by the shuttlepod.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER: (flying the pod) Archer to Enterprise.
T'POL [OC]: Go ahead, Captain.
ARCHER: We're on our way.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: Where are those patrol ships?
T'POL: They won't pose a threat.
ARCHER [OC]: And the Suliban?
T'POL: Their vessels are breaking orbit.
ARCHER [OC]: Good work.
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER: We'll see you in a few minutes.
REED: Tell the Doctor to meet us in Sickbay. My skin is really starting
to itch.
T'POL [OC]: I'll let him know.
TRAVIS: Captain, think they'll make it?
ARCHER: Do I think they'll get out of Tandaran space safely? Yes. Do I
think they'll be all right?

The Enterprise Transcripts - Vox Sola
Vox Sola
 Original Airdate: 1 May, 2002

Captain's starlog, supplemental. I'm beginning to wonder if inviting
the Kreetassans aboard was such a good idea. It's been a challenging
morning, to say the least.
 [Corridor]
 (The long, thin ship is attached to the starboard
airlock, and the Kreetassan's - deep-set eyes, braided hair, blue
foreheads and chins - are striding rapidly through the ship, speaking
their own language, with Archer, Hoshi, T'Pol and Trip in their wake.)
ARCHER: Did you get that?
HOSHI: Tostka. Insult. Some kind of an insult.
T'POL: He's insulting us or we insulted them?
HOSHI: I'm not sure.
CAPTAIN: Tostka!
ARCHER: Ask what we did wrong.
HOSHI: Kjass. Skjask las?
CAPTAIN: Hwajat ajhakjahs!
ARCHER: Well?
HOSHI: You eat like you mate?
TUCKER: You sure that thing's working?
(They arrive at the airlock.)
CAPTAIN: Sasooratt!
HOSHI: I think they want to leave.
T'POL: That much is obvious.
ARCHER: Whatever we've done to offend you, I apologize.
HOSHI: Jhaaratun yiitooratt loorii.
CAPTAIN: Sasooratt!
(Tucker opens the airlock, the aliens step through and the door
closes.)
TUCKER:
Well, this is one for the books. Briefest First Contact.
(But as the Kreetassan's docking port retracts, something white and
filament-like crawls along the outside onto Enterprise, and slithers
inside as the external hatch closes.)
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: Does anybody hear that?
TRAVIS: What, the static?
HOSHI: Frequency distortions mixed in with the static.
TRAVIS: You've got better ears than we do.
HOSHI: It's coming from the comm. system.
T'POL: Have you run a diagnostic?
HOSHI: Twice. I guess today is just not my day.
TRAVIS: How's the translation coming along?
HOSHI: Slowly. Hwajat, their word for eat.
TRAVIS: What about it?
HOSHI: With the emphasis on the first syllable, hwa-jat, it means to
mate.
TRAVIS: I can see how that might cause some confusion over dinner.
HOSHI: Context is critical in every language but Kreetassan has the
most subtle variations I've ever seen. The same word can have a dozen
different meanings.
T'POL: We rely on you to recognise the difference, Ensign.
HOSHI: You think it was my fault?
T'POL: I didn't say that.
HOSHI: You implied it.
T'POL: I simply noted that linguistic matters fall within your
responsibility. For all we know it was Mister Tucker's table manners
that offended them.
HOSHI: But you think if I picked up the language faster they might have
not stormed off the ship.
T'POL: There's no need to react emotionally. Try to learn from failure.
It could help your next first contact be more successful.
HOSHI: Thanks.
(Trip walks onto the Bridge.)
HOSHI: Commander, I'm picking up
some kind of interference from the comm. system. A high-frequency
distortion.
TUCKER: Is it a problem?
HOSHI: Mostly just irritating.
TUCKER: I'll track it down first thing in the morning.
HOSHI: Thanks.
TUCKER: Is he in there?
T'POL: Yes.
TUCKER: How's his mood?
T'POL: Now might not be the best time.
TUCKER: I'll take my chances.
 [Ready room]
(The door chimes.)
 ARCHER: It better be
important.
TUCKER: Prime rib tonight with real horseradish.
ARCHER: Thanks. I'll have the steward send some up. Thought we'd set a
course for this brown dwarf system. Looks interesting.
TUCKER: I can't wait. In the meantime, why don't we shoot a little nine
ball? You can break.
ARCHER: Maybe later.
TUCKER: I was going to save this for a rainy day, but
(He pulls a computer
slide from his pocket.)
TUCKER: Stanford versus Texas.
ARCHER: The finals?
TUCKER: Fresh out of the subspace mailbag. You've been threatening to
teach me the finer points of the game.
(He tosses the slide to Archer.)
TUCKER: Unless
you're too busy with your brown dwarves.
(In Archer's quarters, Porthos leaps onto the bed and starts barking at
the air vent overhead. We see the filament thing moving through a
Jefferies tube.)
 [Mess hall]
 (Travis, Malcolm and Hoshi are eating.)
TRAVIS: What if they just don't like being touched? Remember how
uncomfortable they looked when the Captain tried to shake their hands?
REED: They looked that way the entire time. Besides, they didn't really
lose their temper until they arrived here in the mess hall.
TRAVIS: Are you staying for the movie tonight?
REED: What's playing?
TRAVIS:  Wages of Fear. Classic French
film. No, you'll like it. Things blow up.
REED: Oh, sounds fun. Hoshi?
HOSHI: No, thanks. I'm turning in early.
REED: We might need a translator. Those subtitles go by pretty fast.
HOSHI: I've had enough language problems for one day.(Out in the corridor Hoshi hears something, and puts her ear to the
bulkhead. We see the filament creature on the other side.)
 [Engineering]
 ROSTOV: We're going to have to sit in the back.
KELLY: One minute.
ROSTOV: I hate missing the beginning.
KELLY: It's on the computer. You can watch it whenever you want.
ROSTOV: It's not the same. You don't want to go back and see the first
part after you know how it ends.
KELLY: The power just went out on D deck. Cargo bay two. The lighting
grid's down.
ROSTOV: It's probably just a blown relay. Leave it for the night shift.
KELLY: If it's just a blown relay it'll take you ten minutes to fix.
Here. (Kelly throws him some equipment) KELLY: The comm.'s out too.
 [Mess hall]
 (Converted to a cinema for movie night.)
REED: Two and a half hours?
TRAVIS: Two hours and twenty four minutes.
REED: Seems awfully long for a movie about four men in a truck.
TRAVIS: You'll be on the edge of your seat.
REED: You promised me explosions.
TRAVIS: Don't worry.
(The lights go down, the screen comes on, but it's not the movie, it's
sickbay, then the situation room.)
REED: This is all wrong. (gets up) Excuse me. Reed to Bridge.
VOICE [OC]: Go ahead, Lieutenant.
REED: We're trying to watch a movie down here but instead, we're being
treated to a view of you. So unless you're planning on giving us a
little song and dance, maybe you could see what's gone wrong.
 [Captain's mess]
 (Out of uniform, watching the water-polo game on
the wall screen, eating snacks and drinking beer.)
ARCHER: Come on, come on. Goal for Stanford!
TUCKER: How deep's the pool?
ARCHER: Deep enough so that no one can touch the bottom.
TUCKER: I didn't know it was such a rough game.
ARCHER: Think of it as one part basketball one part swimming and one
part wrestling.
TUCKER: And I thought it was just a bunch of guys screwing around in a
pool.(In cargo bay two, Rostov enters with a torch. He discovers a hole
in the ceiling at the far end with white gung dripping down the walls,
and just catches sight of a white tail slithering away along the floor.
He follows the trail to a while filament construction and gets out his
communicator, when suddenly)
 [Engineering]
 KELLY: Engineering. (silence) Michael, is that
you? Hello?
 [Captain's mess]
 ARCHER: Nice goal!
TUCKER: Did you see the way number twelve set him up? Wait, he's called
the point man, right?
ARCHER: Very good. I told you, best sport in the world.
TUCKER: Well, I'll still take a great off-tackle run out of the
backfield, but I can see how you can get hooked on this.
ARCHER: Thanks for thinking of it.
TUCKER: My pleasure. Now keep watching while Texas trounces your sorry
California butts.
ARCHER: You haven't watched the end of this, have you?
TUCKER: Of course not.
 [Cargo bay two]
 (Kelly has come looking for Rostov.)
KELLY: Hello?
 [Captain's mess]
 TUCKER: What the hell was that?
ARCHER: Oh, number eight on Texas just fouled one of my boys. He's
going to be ejected for twenty seconds.
TUCKER: Is that fair? It gives you guys an advantage.
ARCHER: Well, that's the point. I don't suppose it'd be practical to
put a pool on the ship.
TUCKER: I wouldn't want to be taking a swim if the gravity plating went
offline.
ARCHER: No. No.
KELLY [OC]: Kelly to the Captain.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
KELLY [OC]: Sir, I'm in Cargo bay two and
 [Cargo bay two]
 KELLY: There's some kind of lifeform in here.
 [Captain's mess]
 ARCHER: Lifeform?
KELLY [OC]: It's got Rostov, sir. He's still conscious, but he can't
ARCHER: Crewman?
 [Cargo bay two]
 (Archer and Trip are joined by Reed and a guard at
the door.)
ARCHER: Weapons to stun.
REED: Captain. (Reed goes first, the rest follow carefully.)
TUCKER: Sir?
(Their torches illuminate Kelly, entwined in white filament.)
REED: Careful. (The filament tightens on Kelly.)
ARCHER: The light. (As they lower their torches, the filament loosens
again.)
REED: (gets out scanner) She's alive.
ROSTOV: (bound further up the web) Captain? Leave.
ARCHER: Crewman?
ROSTOV: Leave.
(The group back away, then Reed spots tentacles reaching out.)
REED: Captain!
(Archer is dragged along the floor, Trip hanging onto him. Despite
shooting at the tentacle, he's pulled up into the web, and Tucker is
grabbed around the chest.)
TUCKER: Get out of here! Go!
(The guard tries to get up a staircase but is grabbed by the foot and
pulled in too. Reed dashes for the door and manages to slam it shut,
cutting off an end of a tentacle in the process.)
 [Situation room]
 REED: This thing appears to be growing. There's no
telling if it'll get out of the cargo bay. I recommend we evacuate the
entire deck.
HOSHI: How did it get onboard?
TRAVIS: The last time we opened the airlock, we were docked with the
Kreetassans.
REED: You think they left us a little souvenir?
T'POL: Our encounter didn't go well but I doubt we gave them reason to
attack us. We're not even certain that the organism's hostile.
REED: You didn't see that thing go after the Captain! It seemed hostile
enough to me.
TRAVIS: The Kreetassans might know something about this thing. I can
start scanning for their ship, try to pick up their warp trail.
T'POL: We'll need to communicate with them better than last time.
HOSHI: I'll do my best.
T'POL: T'Pol to Doctor Phlox. Report.
PHLOX [OC]: I'm preparing to examine the specimen. Would you care to
observe?
T'POL: Yes. Stand by. (The display monitor switches to an overhead view of
dissection table with the tentacle on it.)
PHLOX [on monitor]: You'll note that even though it's been severed from
its body, it survives independently
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox is in full protective suit.)  PHLOX: Not unlike the
common earthworm or the Neethian cradlefish.
 [Situation room]
 REED: Do you think that's wise, Doctor?
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox takes hold of the tentacle.)  PHLOX: Possibly not, but
I'm going to need a tissue sample if I hope to learn more about its
physiology. (The tentacle reaches up his arm, and he removes it.) PHLOX: That'll be
quite enough. This is no earthworm.
 [Situation room]
 T'POL: Doctor?
PHLOX [OC]: Look at the synaptic activity. This organism possesses a
very sophisticated nervous system. It could be capable of higher mental
functions.
HOSHI: If it's intelligent maybe we can communicate with it. The
frequency distortions, they look a lot like the phonetic patterns in
certain Andorian dialects.
REED: With all due respect, Hoshi, we're not talking about nouns and
verbs here. It could take you days to learn a language like that, even
if it is one.
HOSHI: What other choice do we have? Give me a chance.
T'POL: I'm sorry, Ensign, there isn't enough time.
HOSHI: Sub-Commander.
T'POL: We need to neutralise it, quickly. You said phase pistols had no
effect?
REED: None that I could tell.
T'POL: Then I suggest you find a method that does.
PHLOX [OC]: If I may, the organism is highly photo-sensitive. A
sustained burst of EM radiation might be enough to stun the creature.
T'POL: Can you assemble some EM emitters?
REED: It'll take a few minutes.
 [Cargo bay two]
 ROSTOV: Why doesn't it just kill us?
TUCKER: Take it easy.
ARCHER: I'm sure T'Pol and Malcolm are doing everything they can to get
us out of here. Can either of you see Crewman Kelly?
ROSTOV: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: How's she look?
ROSTOV: She's still breathing.
TUCKER: Zabel's still unconscious.
ROSTOV: Captain?
ARCHER: Yeah.
ROSTOV: I imagine in a situation like this they'd cancel the movie.
ARCHER: I imagine so.
ROSTOV: I really wanted to see it. Yves Montand driving explosives
through the mountains.
ARCHER: I'll make sure they reschedule it for next week.
ROSTOV: Thank you, sir.
(Reed and other men enter the cargo bay, and fire off their light
emitters.)
 [Situation room]
 PHLOX: It's working.
 [Cargo bay two]
 (The captives start screaming and writhing in
their bonds.)
REED: Bridge, something's wrong.
 [Situation room]
 PHLOX: Shut off the emitters.
REED [OC]: Doctor?
PHLOX: Shut them off.
 [Cargo bay two]
 REED: Off.
(The creature stops twitching and the captives stop screaming.)
 [Situation room]
 T'POL: What happened?
PHLOX: Their nervous systems appear to be linked to the organism's.
They're sharing autonomic functions, neural impulses. If we continue
firing we could end up killing our own people.
T'POL: Mister Reed, withdraw your team.
 [Cargo bay two]
 REED: Understood.
 [Situation room]
 PHLOX: The rate of symbiosis is increasing. If we
don't find a way to extract them soon their systems will be too
integrated with the creature. I won't be able to separate them.
T'POL: (to Hoshi) You wanted a chance to communicate. I suggest you
begin.
 [Sickbay]
 (Looking at five sets of lifesign readouts on the
monitor.)
T'POL: How much time do they have?
PHLOX: A few hours at most. Their metabolic rates are dropping.
Temperature, respiration.
REED: There must be some way to cut them out of there.
PHLOX: I'm not sure if you appreciate how alien this creature is. It's
not attacking our crewmen, it's trying to integrate them into itself.
REED: The end result's the same.
PHLOX: At some point in the very near future there won't be six
lifeforms in that cargo bay. There'll only be one.
 [Corridor]
 REED: If that thing continues to grow, we're going
to have to find a way to contain it.
T'POL: Do you have a suggestion?
REED: Starfleet's been working on creating a stable EM barrier for the
last five years.
T'POL: A force field.
REED: Right. They just haven't found a way to control the particle
density. All the specs are in the database. I've been trying to
jerry-rig a prototype of my own.
T'POL: And?
REED: I've got it stable enough to absorb a phase pistol blast sixty
percent of the time. I think I can improve on that.
T'POL: I suggest you work quickly.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: I think I found them.
T'POL: Where?
TRAVIS: Point five two light years from here.
T'POL: Lay in a course.
TRAVIS: I already have. I've been sending out hails but we're still out
of comm. range.
T'POL: Let me know as soon as they respond.
 [Situation room]
 T'POL: Any progress?
HOSHI: Believe me, you'd be the first to know. I'm sorry. It's
frustrating. I'm not having a lot of luck.
T'POL: The situation requires expertise, not luck.
HOSHI: Maybe I don't have the expertise.
T'POL: If you don't, no one else aboard Enterprise does.
HOSHI: I'm doing my best.
T'POL: It was your suggestion that we attempt to communicate with it.
If you don't think that's possible, we'll have to find another
solution.
HOSHI: I've made a little progress, but our translation matrix isn't
designed for this. Look at it. It's more like a calculus equation than
a language.
T'POL: Mathematics is sometimes considered a form of language.
HOSHI: What I'm trying to say is that I could use help from someone
with a background in higher mathematics.
T'POL: Perhaps I can assist you.
 [Cargo bay two]
 TUCKER: The Texas goalie can't block to his right
because he keeps his hands too deep.
ARCHER: How do you know that?
ROSTOV: Captain, I know it too, and I don't understand anything about
water polo.
ARCHER: It's this lifeform. It's linking us together somehow.
TUCKER: We got to get out!
ARCHER: Calm down.
TUCKER: This thing's gotten inside our heads!
ARCHER: Trip, do you know what I'm thinking about?
TUCKER: Now's not the time to be thinking about the regionals.
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: Senior year, North American regionals against Princeton. We, I
mean, you were down by two goals under a minute left.
ARCHER: And what was I thinking? What was I thinking.
TUCKER: You thought you could win every game. You always thought you
could win. No matter how far behind you were.
ARCHER: And we did. We went on the finals that year. As soon as you
give up, the game's lost.
 [Sickbay]
 REED: How's our little friend? (He means the tentacle.)
PHLOX: Fast asleep. It appears to have entered a dormant state.
Probably a reaction to the shock of being severed from the larger
organism.
REED: But it's alive?
PHLOX: Very much so.
REED: Good. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to run a few tests of my
own.
PHLOX: What kind of tests?
REED: I need to determine how much bioelectric stress it can tolerate.
PHLOX: May I ask why?
REED: I'm trying to create a force field to isolate the cargo bay, but
if it's going to work, I have to calculate how much of a jolt it will
take to repel the organism without killing it or any of the people it's
taken.
PHLOX: If you intend to pummel this appendage with EM radiation until
it cries for mercy, I'm afraid I can't permit that.
REED: Why not?
PHLOX: This is more than just a severed limb. It exhibits all the signs
of an intelligent being.
REED: Intelligent being or not, its big brother is in the Cargo bay
strangling the Captain and four other crewmen. If we don't do something
to contain it now it could pose a threat to everyone on board.
PHLOX: There are less invasive ways to gather the information you need.
REED: Such as?
PHLOX: Microcellular analysis.
REED: How long would that take?
PHLOX: Less than an hour.
REED: In less than an hour that thing could spread across half a deck.
PHLOX: I'm willing to help you, Mister Reed, but not if it means
torturing this organism. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't our mission
to try to better understand unique forms of life?
REED: Not if they're trying to kill the Captain.
PHLOX: We don't know anything about this creature's intentions.
REED: I admire your interspecies ethics, but until Hoshi tells me she's
found a way to communicate with it, I have to assume its intentions are
hostile. Now, if you don't mind.
PHLOX: If you want information to help you construct your force field,
you'll acquire it under my supervision.
REED: I'm sure I don't have to remind you, Doctor, I am the ranking
officer here.
PHLOX: Not in my Sickbay, unless the Captain says otherwise.
REED: The Captain is in no condition to offer an opinion.
PHLOX: Precisely.
REED: Fine. Your rules, but we'd better get to it.
 [Mess hall]
 (The two women are working at separate tables.)
T'POL: What if we used a bilateral algorithm?
HOSHI: I already tried.
T'POL: Did you compensate for frequency drift?
HOSHI: I wouldn't be much of a comm. officer if I didn't.
T'POL: Allowing your emotions to control you won't help solve this
problem, Ensign.
HOSHI: Neither will questioning everything I do.
T'POL: You asked for my help.
HOSHI: I didn't ask for you to keep count of every time I make a
mistake, or to second-guess all of my decisions.
T'POL: As First Officer it's my duty to supervise you.
HOSHI: This goes beyond duty, Sub-Commander. You've been looking over
my shoulder ever since you came on board. Double-checking my log
entries, my translations.
T'POL: It's my job.
HOSHI: Is that all we're talking about? You don't think I belong on
Enterprise, do you.
T'POL: On the contrary. It would be a great loss to Starfleet if you
were not a part of this crew. If you feel I've been unfair to you, I
apologise, but I hold you to a high standard, Ensign, because I know
you're capable of achieving it. Shall we continue?
HOSHI: Yes. Why don't we take another look at the sub-harmonics. I was
thinking we could run it through the decryption matrix, see if we can
find a pattern. All I see is numbers, codes.
T'POL: Any code can be broken.
 [Bridge]
 (Travis is basically on his own when an incoming
signal beep starts up.)
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen: You hailed us?
TRAVIS: You speak English.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: We studied your database. It wasn't difficult.
TRAVIS: Okay. We have a problem.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Yes?
TRAVIS: There'an alien organism on our ship.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Yes?
TRAVIS: It came aboard around the same time we saw you. We were hoping
you might know something about it.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Describe this organism.
TRAVIS: Well, it's big, but it didn't start out that way. It's like a
large mass of tendrils.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Tendrils?
TRAVIS: Like a giant web, but it moves and grows.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: We have seen this.
TRAVIS: Where?
CAPTAIN: On its home world. Perhaps it attached itself to our ship. It
wasn't our fault.
TRAVIS: Can you tell us where this planet is?
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Apologise.
TRAVIS: Excuse me?
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: We will send you the coordinates but first
you must apologise to us for your offence.
TRAVIS: That's the thing. We don't know what we did to offend you.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: On your ship, you put food in your mouths.
TRAVIS: You mean eat.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Yes. Eat.
TRAVIS: I don't understand.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: It is like mating. It is very offensive to us.
TRAVIS: We were just eating. How do you eat?
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: We eat the same way, but not in the presence
of others.
TRAVIS: I see. Okay. Please believe me, we had no idea that would be
offensive to you. It was simply a misunderstanding. On behalf of the
entire crew, I sincerely apologise.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Your apology is accepted.
TRAVIS: Thank you. Now, could I have those coordinates?
 [Cargo bay two]
 TUCKER: Captain.
ARCHER: Yeah.
TUCKER: I feel you've drifted away over there.
ARCHER: You aren't feeling much better than I do. Rostov?
TUCKER: He's out. When Zephram Cochrane talked about new life and new
civilisation do you think this is what he meant?
 [Mess hall]
 HOSHI: Here, here it is. I found a third set of
repetitions. Try it. Just a few more and the UT can start building a
syntax.
PHLOX [OC]: Phlox to T'Pol.
T'POL: Go ahead.
PHLOX [OC]: I know you're under a great deal of pressure
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: But Crewman Kelly's metabolic rate has
dropped to a critical level. Whatever you're planning to do
 [Mess hall]
 PHLOX [OC]: You'd better do it soon.
T'POL: Understood.
 [Armoury]
(A crewman makes final adjustments to the emitters.)
 CREWMAN: Ready, sir.
(Reed flips a switch, a wobbly forcefield comes on, and the crewman
fires a phase pistol at it. The beam is stopped briefly, then passes
through and the field collapses.)
REED: The particle density's still fluctuating. I think the problem's
in the lower left quadrant.
CREWMAN : Got it, sir.
REED: Try again. (The phase beam doesn't penetrate this time.)REED: Better.
T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Lieutenant Reed.
REED: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: We've made some progress on the translation, but we're
going to need to get into the cargo bay to test it. Is the forcefield
ready?
REED: I'm making the final calibrations now.
T'POL [OC]: You'll have to do it quickly. Doctor Phlox says our people
don't have much time.
REED: Understood.
 {Cargo bay two]
 TUCKER: Captain? (No reply. The web has grown
even more, and the two crewmen are just about invisible under the white
filaments. Trip and Archer's faces can still be seen. Reed and his
assistant creep into the bay and put the forcefield emitters up on the
walls a metre or so in from the door. A tentacle come to investigate
and the forcefield stops it.)
REED: Emitter B's off by three point two microns. (He steps outside to
speak to T'Pol, Hoshi and Phlox.) REED: The forcefield's working, but I can't
guarantee how long it will hold. Have you done it?
T'POL: We're about to find out.
(The group goes back inside and Hoshi switches on the Universal
Translator.)
REED: It just sounds like a constant tone.
HOSHI: I'm going to create distortions in the tone. Hopefully, the
organism will understand what I'm trying to do.
(Phlox's scanner shows vital signs at dangerously low levels. After her
third attempt, the creature responds to the tones.) HOSHI: Come on, just a
little more. I think I've got enough to try something simple.
T'POL: Ask what it wants.
HOSHI: It's talking to us.
T'POL: What's it saying? Ensign.
HOSHI: Hold on. It's giving us coordinates.
REED: Its home world?
T'POL: The Kreetassans already gave them to us.
HOSHI: These look more like the latitude and longitude. I think it's
trying to give us an exact location of the planet.
T'POL: Tell it we're taking it back.
PHLOX: Commander Tucker's heart rate is increasing.
REED: Is that good or bad?
PHLOX: Good. Crewman Kelly's biosigns are stabilising as well.
(Suddenly there is total silence, then a slithering sound as the four
humans are gently unwrapped.) T'POL: Lower the force field. Lieutenant.
PHLOX: Medical Team, report to Cargo bay two.
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Acknowledged.
 [Planet surface]
 (Enterprise arrives at a planet and launches a
shuttlepod. It lands and four figures in spacesuits carry a box between
them into a clear area in a massive web structure.)
T'POL: Here.
HOSHI: Look at all of them.
T'POL: Not them, it. This is all one organism.
(They open the box and the white thing crawls out to rejoin the big
web.)
REED: The part that got on board, why did it take our people?
PHLOX: Hard to say. When it got separated from itself, perhaps it
needed a physical connection with any lifeform it could find. (He opens
a small box and the severed tentacle slithers out to be rejoined as
well.  As the pod takes off, we see that the organism stretches to the
horizon and possibly beyond.)

  [Captain's
mess]
 (Archer is choking on his food.)
TUCKER: Excuse me?
T'POL: I asked if you've
ARCHER: We heard you. What makes you think we're suffering from a lack
of sexual activity?
T'POL: Starfleet forbids officers from fraternising with subordinates.
Unless you've been violating regulations
TUCKER: Those regulations don't apply to you. Have you been suffering?
T'POL: On Vulcan, we mate only once every seven years.
TUCKER: That's a hell of a dry spell.
ARCHER: Why are you suddenly so curious about this?
T'POL: It's my understanding that your mating ritual is effective in
easing tension.
TUCKER: That hasn't always been my experience.
ARCHER: And you think that we need our tensions eased?
T'POL: Efficiency's down three percent.
ARCHER: We've all gone about ten months without a break. I think it's
normal for people to get a little sloppy.
T'POL: Perhaps it's time the crew takes shore leave.
TUCKER: Well, I like the sound of that.
T'POL: I took the liberty of locating a suitable planet approximately
nine days from our present location. It's called Risa.
TUCKER: What's your idea of suitable?
T'POL: It's tropical, with an abundance of pristine beaches. You'll
find more information in the Vulcan database.
ARCHER: Is it populated?
T'POL: Yes, by a humanoid culture receptive to easing tension.
 [Deleted scene - Mess Hall]
 TRAVIS: Look at this. They've got sea
rays the size of shuttlepods.
REED: I didn't know you were a diver.
TRAVIS: I've never done it, but if there was ever a time to learn.
'Your guides are genetically enhanced to breathe underwater.' And
they're all female.
(Hoshi rolls her eyes, Reed suddenly gets interested.)
REED: Mermaids.
HOSHI: I read that at any time there can be thousands of visitors there
speaking hundreds of different languages.
REED: Are you going to spend your vacation doing the same thing you've
been doing onboard for the last ten months?
HOSHI: How I relax is my business.
TRAVIS: How about you, Lieutenant?
REED: Well, I'm certainly up for meeting some new people.
HOSHI: Why don't you come with me?
REED: I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping for something more than
a linguistic seminar.
 [Bridge]
 (Tucker enters wearing an Hawaiian shirt.)
T'POL: If you're wearing that to impress the women on Risa, you may as
well stay on board.
TUCKER: Rule number one, you've got to be seen to get noticed. And I
plan on getting noticed.
ARCHER: Don't say she didn't warn you.
TUCKER: Figured out your itinerary yet?
ARCHER: I think I'm going to pass.
TUCKER: Captain, you need this as much as I do.
ARCHER: Nobody needs this as much as you do. The ship will be nice and
quiet. I've got some astrometric surveys that have been piling up.
It'll be a good chance to get some work done.
TUCKER: We're going to a planet with over two hundred registered Nuvian
masseuses and you're going to sit in your cabin with a bunch of star
charts?
T'POL: Mister Tucker has a point.
ARCHER: You think I need a massage?
T'POL: The safety of this ship depends on its captain being at his most
efficient.
ARCHER: I suppose I could read those surveys on a nice beach.
T'POL: Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command.
ARCHER: Transfer it to my Ready room.
 [Ready room]
 FORREST [on monitor]: Her name's V'Lar. She's the
Vulcan ambassador to a planet called Mazar.
ARCHER: If you don't mind my asking, Admiral, why is this our problem?
FORREST [on monitor]: Apparently, it's imperative that she be taken off
that planet as soon as possible. The nearest Vulcan ship is at least a
week away.
ARCHER: Do they expect us to take her all the way back to Vulcan?
FORREST [on monitor]: You'll rendezvous with the Vulcan ship Sh'Raan in
three days. They'll take her the rest of the way.
ARCHER: Any idea what the emergency is?
FORREST [on monitor]: Well, this may come as a shock to you, Jon, but
the Vulcans aren't talking.
ARCHER: Imagine that.
 [Hoshi's quarters]
 T'POL: Thank you for volunteering your quarters.
HOSHI: I'm happy to do it. I'm looking forward to meeting her.
T'POL: I imagine she'll spend most of the journey alone, engaged in
meditation, but if it seems appropriate I'll ask if she'll meet with
you.
HOSHI: Thanks. Well, if there's anything else I can do.
T'POL: If you wouldn't mind taking that. (A picture in a frame.)
T'POL: Ambassador V'Lar is accustomed to a Spartan environment. (Archer arrives just as Hoshi tries to leave.)
ARCHER: Hoshi, thanks for
giving up your cabin.
HOSHI: I just hope it's Spartan enough, sir. (Hoshi leaves.)
ARCHER: Everything set?
T'POL: I believe so. I've prepared this to familiarize the crew with
the necessary protocols. (She hands over a PADD.) T'POL: We should assign a steward
to attend to her needs.
ARCHER: (reading) Don't address the ambassador unless spoken to first.
Don't offer to shake hands. Refrain from laughing in her presence.
T'POL: Those guidelines are largely precautionary. I doubt the crew
will have much opportunity to interact with her.
ARCHER: You seem to be pulling out all the stops.
T'POL: I'm simply following the protocols used in dealing with an
ambassador of V'Lar's distinction.
ARCHER: Well, she'll be here soon enough. Let me know if you need any
help.
T'POL: Thank you, Captain.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Entering orbit, sir.
HOSHI: We're being hailed. It's the Mazarite High Council.
ARCHER: Someone's in a hurry.
OFFICIAL [on viewscreen]: Captain Archer? (A humanoid, grey hair at
temples, ears with channel extending across cheek bone.)
ARCHER: I'm Jonathan Archer.
OFFICIAL [on viewscreen]: Are you prepared to receive Ambassador V'Lar?
ARCHER: That's why we're here. If you'll transmit your landing
coordinates to us, we'll send down a shuttlepod. I'm looking forward
to the visit.
OFFICIAL [on viewscreen]: I regret there won't be time for that. The
ambassador is already on her way to your ship.
TRAVIS: A small craft's approaching, sir.
OFFICIAL [on viewscreen]: I assume the Vulcans have informed you of the
urgency of this matter.
ARCHER: They said it was important we pick up the ambassador as quickly
as possible. They didn't say why.
OFFICIAL [on viewscreen]: V'Lar has been expelled for abuse of her
position and criminal misconduct.
 [Docking hatch]
(Ambassador V'Lar is a short, well-rounded mature woman.)
 V'LAR: Captain Archer?
ARCHER: Ambassador. On behalf of my crew I'd like to welcome you aboard
Enterprise. (V'Lar holds out her right hand.)
V'LAR: Thank you. (They shake. Archer gestures to her hold-all.) 
ARCHER: May I take that?
V'LAR: That's very thoughtful, Captain.
ARCHER: This is Commander Charles Tucker, my Chief Engineer.
TUCKER: Pleased to meet you.
V'LAR: The pleasure is mine, Commander. (They shakes hands.)
ARCHER: And this is my Science Officer, Sub-Commander T'Pol.
T'POL: T'nar pahk sarat y'rani.
V'LAR: T'nar jaral. But please, I've been anticipating the opportunity
to practice my English.
 [Captain's mess]
 ARCHER: I hope you like your quarters, Ambassador.
T'Pol tried very hard to anticipate your needs.
V'LAR: Fortunately my needs are few, Captain. I am curious, though. Who
previously occupied the cabin?
T'POL: The odour. The human scent is difficult to mask.
V'LAR: Actually, I was hoping to meet the crew member in order to thank
her for allowing me to disrupt her routine. I prefer not to
inconvenience anyone if possible. That philosophy has served me well in
the diplomatic service.
ARCHER: T'Pol tells me you negotiated the first territorial accords
between Vulcan and Andoria.
V'LAR: The Andorians required a somewhat firmer hand at the negotiating
table. But I was younger then. That was before we even made contact
with Earth.
TUCKER: That was over ninety years ago. How long have you been a
diplomat?
V'LAR: Commander Tucker, I understood that on your world it is
considered bad manners to ask a lady her age.
TUCKER: Well, I wasn't, er, I, er, didn't mean to imply that you were,
er
V'LAR: Forgive me, Commander. My attempt at humour. Suffice it to say
that with T'Pol and myself here, you're almost certainly dining with
the two oldest people on this ship.
T'POL: I hope, Ambassador, that you regard the charges against you with
less levity.
V'LAR: Of course I do.
T'POL: How do you intend to defend yourself?
V'LAR: There is no defence.
T'POL: Are you saying you're guilty?
ARCHER: T'Pol.
V'LAR: It's all right, Captain. A person in my position carries the
trust of all Vulcans. The fact that the Mazarites believe that trust
has been compromised justifies T'Pol's concern. I'm afraid my age is
betraying me, Captain. Would you mind if I retired?
ARCHER: Of course not. (T'Pol accompanies her.)
 [Corridor]
 V'LAR: I've never been to Earth, but I find the
humans I have encountered quite unpredictable. I'd be interested in
hearing about your experiences there.
T'POL: Another time, perhaps.
V'LAR: I understand.
T'POL: This is your cabin. I'll say good night.
V'LAR: T'Pol. I sense your anger.
T'POL: You presume that my time with humans has left me susceptible to
their emotions.
V'LAR: They're our emotions as well. We simply hide them better.
T'POL: If you're sensing anything from me, it isn't anger.
V'LAR: No. Disappointment.
T'POL: Good night, Ambassador.
(T'Pol leaves. Further down another corridor -)
ARCHER: T'Pol.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: Is there a problem I should be aware of?
T'POL: I assume you're talking about Ambassador V'Lar.
ARCHER: You were a bit abrupt with her.
T'POL: If you believe I was rude, I'll convey my apologies.
ARCHER: I don't pretend to understand Vulcans. I never have. But I
wouldn't be a very good captain if I didn't know when something was
bothering my science officer.
T'POL: It's uncommon for a Vulcan to commit a crime.
ARCHER: Uncommon, but not unheard of.
T'POL: Unheard of for a person in Ambassador V'Lar's position.
ARCHER: We don't know what she's done.
T'POL: It doesn't matter. If she were innocent, she would have insisted
on staying to defend herself.
ARCHER: You seem to know a lot about her.
T'POL: I've met the ambassador before, though she clearly doesn't
recall. It was many years ago on Vulcan during my early schooling. She
had just negotiated the Treaty of Ka'Tann and I travelled a great
distance to see her.
ARCHER: Was it worth the trip?
T'POL: The ambassador inspired me to choose a direction in my own life.
A path that led me to the Science Council, and eventually here.
ARCHER: I've had a few heroes in my life. It's never easy when one of
them lets you down.
T'POL: Vulcans don't have heroes.
ARCHER: No, I'm sure they don't.
REED [OC]: Captain, can you come to the Bridge?
ARCHER: On my way.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: An unidentified vessel, sir, fifty
thousand kilometres and closing.
HOSHI: They're hailing us.
ARCHER: Let's find out who they are. (another Mazarite is on the
viewscreen) What can we do for you?
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: My apologies, Captain. There's been a change
of plans regarding Ambassador V'Lar.
ARCHER: We weren't told.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: We've been having some problems with our
long-range communications.
ARCHER: What's the change of plans?
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: The magistrate feels that we let the
ambassador go too quickly. She's needed for additional questioning. We
don't want to cause you any more inconvenience. If you'll drop out of
warp, we can dock with you and take the ambassador aboard our ship.
ARCHER: Your magistrate seemed in a big hurry to get rid of her. Now he
wants her back?
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: I'm just a transport captain. I never try to
make sense of what government bureaucrats are thinking.
ARCHER: I'll have to contact my superiors.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: There's really no need.
ARCHER: I'm just a starship captain. You don't think they'd trust me to
make these kinds of decisions on my own?
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: We'll wait for you to confirm whatever you
have to. (End transmission.)
ARCHER: Get me Starfleet Command.
HOSHI: I can't get through. That ship's jamming all our comm.
frequencies.
ARCHER: Just a transport captain.
REED: They're charging weapons.
ARCHER: Polarise the hull plating. (The Mazarite ship fires several
charges at Enterprise.) ARCHER: What the hell is he doing? Hail him.
HOSHI: He's not answering.
REED: Port hull plating's offline.
TRAVIS: They're closing, fast.
ARCHER: Aft torpedoes. Return fire.
REED: No effect. They're using some kind of energy shielding.
T'POL: Direct hit to Engineering, subsection 12. We've taken damage.
ARCHER: Would the phase cannons be more effective?
REED: Undoubtedly, but we can't fire them at warp.
ARCHER: What do you mean, we can't fire them at warp?
REED: Particle discharge, sir. It would destabilize our warp field and
most likely blow out both our nacelles. I've been working on the
problem, but I haven't quite
ARCHER: Drop to impulse. Deploy the aft cannon.
REED: I've got a lock.
ARCHER: Fire. (Two shots and then.)
REED: Their shields are failing.
ARCHER: See what you can do about their engines. (One shot is heard.)
REED: They're dead in the water, sir. (They are jolted by another weapons hit.)
HOSHI: Not dead enough.
ARCHER: Resume course, warp four.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: (to T'Pol) Any idea what that was all about? (silence) Well, I
think we know someone who might.
 [Hoshi's quarters]
 ARCHER: We were asked to pick you up and deliver
you to a Vulcan ship. No one said anything about getting shot at.
T'POL: You have no idea who they were?
V'LAR: Obviously they weren't sent by the council on Mazar.
ARCHER: Then who sent them?
V'LAR: I have no answers for you.
T'POL: Ambassador, we're here at the request of the Vulcan High
Command. It would be illogical for you to withhold information from us.
V'LAR: There are diplomatic matters at stake here which do not concern
you. To tell you any more would only put your ship and your crew at
greater risk.
ARCHER: How much greater could it get? A few more volleys from that
ship would have ruptured our hull.
V'LAR: I'm sorry, Captain.
ARCHER: So am I. You're leaving me no choice, Ambassador. Archer to
Mayweather.
TRAVIS [OC]: Go ahead.
ARCHER: Change of plans, Travis. Lay in a course back to Mazar.
TRAVIS [OC]: Sir?
ARCHER: You heard me.
TRAVIS [OC]: Aye, sir.
V'LAR: You're under strict orders to transport me to the Sh'Raan.
ARCHER: It's more than two days to the rendezvous point, and there
could be other hostile ships tracking us. Unless you can convince me
why it's worth risking all our lives.
 [Ready room]
 FORREST [on monitor]: The Vulcans are raising holy
hell about this, Jon.
ARCHER: You could always order me to take her to the rendezvous point.
FORREST [on monitor]: You're out there, I'm not. It's your call. I just
want you to know there'll be repercussions.
ARCHER: They certainly considered the repercussions. They knew someone
was after her. Why risk one of your own ships when you can risk one of
ours?
FORREST [on monitor]: Jon.
ARCHER: They're doing it to us again, Admiral. Keeping us in the dark.
FORREST [on monitor]: Have you talked to the ambassador?
ARCHER: I've tried.
FORREST [on monitor]: Maybe she brought this on herself. You did say
that she admitted the charges against her were true.
ARCHER: I don't even know what the charges against her are.
FORREST [on monitor]: Well, I'll talk to Soval, see what I can find
out.
 [Armoury]
 TUCKER: You really enjoy this, don't you.
REED: Replacing power couplings? Hardly.
TUCKER: No, I mean having people shoot at us.
REED: If you must know, I much prefer the shooting back part.
TUCKER: I thought this mission was about peaceful exploration.
REED: I need something to do on this ship, Commander.
TUCKER: Fair enough. I'm just hoping we don't keep you quite so busy. I
read those Nuvian masseuses have twelve fingers on each hand.
REED: Then I'd say Starfleet needs to make its presence known on Risa.
 [Mess hall]
 (Hoshi and V'Lar are looking out of a window.)
T'POL: I hope I'm not interrupting.
V'LAR: Not at all.
HOSHI: We were just talking about my quarters.
V'LAR: I was wondering why they were so sparsely decorated.
T'POL: If you need anything, it can be brought to you.
V'LAR: I don't want to be waited on. And since I doubt I'll be
travelling to Earth any time soon, I decided to spend a little time
with my hosts. Thank you for the use of your quarters. You'll have them
back soon enough.
HOSHI: Pash tah.
V'LAR: Pash tah.
HOSHI: Sub-Commander. (Hoshi leaves.)
V'LAR: Have you tried iced tea?
T'POL: I don't care for it.
V'LAR: Captain Archer certainly does. It's flavoured with passion
fruit. An appropriate ingredient for him, don't you think?
T'POL: It was the Captain that I wanted to speak to you about.
V'LAR: He's a most intriguing man.
T'POL: He deserves to be told the truth. (V'Lar sits at a table.)
V'LAR: Will you join me? Please. We'll be back at
Mazar in a few hours. I'd prefer not to waste that time alone. This
must be awkward for you, having a foot in two worlds. Loyal to your
Captain, yet still a Vulcan.
T'POL: You can make things easier for him. The High Command has
requested his assistance. It doesn't seem unreasonable to ask why.
V'LAR: You believe Captain Archer can be trusted?
T'POL: Yes.
V'LAR: Even though he clearly doesn't trust us?
T'POL: He's resentful.
V'LAR: Why?
T'POL: He believes we held back their development of warp technology.
V'LAR: We've kept many things from them, all for good reason.
T'POL: But situations like this only reinforce their resentment. If we
expect to continue our relations with humanity we have to earn their
trust.
V'LAR: I would not have succeeded at my career for ninety four years
without earning people's trust.
T'POL: I meant no insult.
V'LAR: Of course not. You were simply speaking your mind, as you always
have. It was at Vulcana Regar, wasn't it? During the second Ka'Tann
conference, you approached me during a recess.
T'POL: You remember.
V'LAR: You were not easy to forget. Your questions about my negotiating
tactics were quite presumptuous coming from one so young.
T'POL: I apologise if I acted inappropriately.
V'LAR: Not at all. In fact, your bluntness made me reconsider some of
my positions, much as it has now. T'Pol, I have something to tell you.
 [Archer's quarters]
 (Archer is sitting on his bed, playing with
Porthos. Doorbell.)
ARCHER: Come in. (T'Pol enters.) ARCHER: Something wrong?
T'POL: I took the liberty of speaking with Ambassador V'Lar.
ARCHER: Go on. (He puts Porthos down.) ARCHER: Any luck?
T'POL: The ambassador and I spent the last two hours talking. She's
even more remarkable than her reputation suggests.
ARCHER: I don't doubt that, but it doesn't affect my decision.
T'POL: I believe it should. She's not guilty of the crime she's been
accused of.
ARCHER: She told you that?
T'POL: The charges were fabricated to get her off Mazar and divert
attention from her actual mission.
ARCHER: Which is?
T'POL: She can't reveal that, but she's convinced me that it's critical
we help her accomplish it.
ARCHER: I'm sorry T'Pol, but I'm going to need more than that.
T'POL: She also told me that if we return her to Mazar she'll be
killed.
ARCHER: By who?
T'POL: She wouldn't tell me.
ARCHER: But you believed her?
T'POL: Yes.
ARCHER: Why?
T'POL: I can't accept that she'd sacrifice a lifetime of
accomplishments with an act of criminal misconduct.
ARCHER: It happens all the time.
T'POL: Not to her. We must take her to the Sh'Raan.
ARCHER: You're asking me to put the lives of everyone on board in
jeopardy based on your talking to this woman for a couple of hours.
T'POL: Captain, since I've served aboard Enterprise I've never asked
you for anything. I'm asking for this now. Don't return the ambassador
to Mazar. Please. (he nods) Thank you.
 [Deleted scene - Bridge]
 TRAVIS: You've been to Risa, haven't you?
T'POL: Yes.
HOSHI: Well, what's it like?
T'POL: A Minshara class planet with three moons. Its gravity is
approximately equal to Earth's sea level.
TRAVIS: How's the ocean?
T'POL: I wouldn't know.
REED: Any good restaurants?
T'POL: I'm told there are. It's all in the database.
HOSHI: Did you do anything there?
T'POL: I meditated in an isolation chamber filled with warm alluvial
mud.
REED: I imagine that's quite good for the skin. (interrupted by a beep)
Three ships coming up fast.
T'POL: Polarise the hull plating. Captain, report to the Bridge.
 [Bridge]
 REED: Our Mazarite friends, sir, and they've
brought company.
ARCHER: Why didn't we see them coming?
HOSHI: Our aft sensors are still out of alignment.
T'POL: They're targeting our engines.
REED: We could drop to impulse, use the phase cannons.
ARCHER: And go three against one? (to T'Pol) You're familiar with the
Mazarites. What's their top speed?
T'POL: Comparable to Starfleet. I don't believe they've exceeded warp
five.
ARCHER: Then let's give them a run for their money. Travis, increase
speed to warp four point eight.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir. Warp four point eight.
T'POL: They're matching our speed and accelerating. Warp four point
nine.
REED: They're closing to twenty thousand kilometres. Fifteen.
 [Deleted scene - Engineering]
 ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Engineering.
TUCKER: I was wondering when you were going to call. We're really
stoking the boilers down here.
ARCHER [OC]: Keep shovelling. We're going to four point nine.
TUCKER: Just in case anyone's keeping track, I believe that'll be a
Starfleet record.
ARCHER [OC]: Let's celebrate later.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Travis.
TRAVIS: Warp four point nine. (The ship shakes a bit.)
REED: They're holding at four point nine, sir.
ARCHER: How far to the rendezvous point?
TRAVIS: At this speed, a little over two hours, but I don't think we
can hold it that long.
ARCHER: Can we get a message through to the Vulcans?
HOSHI: The Mazarites are still jamming us.
ARCHER: Keep trying. That Vulcan ship better not be late.
V'LAR: Captain, what's our situation?
ARCHER: We're being chased by three Mazarite ships.
V'LAR: Will we reach the Sh'Raan before they can do any more damage?
ARCHER: I'm not sure.
V'LAR: In that case, I need to speak with you.
 [Ready room]
 V'LAR: I have to consider the possibility that
this mission will fail.
ARCHER: You still haven't told me what this mission is.
V'LAR: I've been under orders to tell you only what you need to know,
but that wasn't the only reason I kept things from you. I didn't trust
you. As your Mister Tucker pointed out, I have been around a long time.
I remember when news of your people first reached Vulcan. I was
fascinated by humanity but worried as well.
ARCHER: You hadn't even met us.
V'LAR: You had just emerged from a global war. The idea that you deemed
yourselves ready to join the interstellar community seemed premature.
ARCHER: And a century of good behaviour hasn't changed your mind?
V'LAR: The Mazarites pursuing us are criminals. They are members of an
organisation that's infiltrated all levels of government, making
themselves wealthy and powerful at the expense of many innocent
victims. Their methods include eliminating anyone who stands in their
way.
ARCHER: And that would include you.
V'LAR: Many Mazarites want their government purged of this corruption.
They asked the Vulcan consulate to help them expose these criminals.
ARCHER: And that job fell to you?
V'LAR: I have been gathering evidence against them. In three months, I
will be called to testify. It was decided that until then I would be
safer on Vulcan.
ARCHER: Why couldn't you tell us?
V'LAR: The investigation was considered too sensitive.
ARCHER: And the story of you being recalled in disgrace?
V'LAR: It was hoped that if my reputation were sullied they would not
consider me a credible witness, and they might not come after me.
ARCHER: Obviously, it didn't work.
V'LAR: The corruption ran deeper than I thought.
ARCHER: I appreciate you telling me the truth.
V'LAR: I can no longer put you and your crew in danger, Captain. Please
drop out of warp. I plan to surrender myself to them.
ARCHER: It hasn't gotten to that yet.
V'LAR: It's the most logical course of action.
ARCHER: If you've learned anything about humans, you'd know we don't
always take the most logical course of action.
T'POL [OC]: Captain, report to the Bridge.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: They're hailing us.
ARCHER: What's our status?
T'POL: Holding at warp four point nine, but Commander Tucker doesn't
believe we can sustain it for more than another ten minutes.
REED: I don't believe they can either, sir. They're releasing drive
plasma to keep their warp coils from overloading.
ARCHER: Open a channel.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Captain. Ambassador.
ARCHER: What do you want?
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Just giving you a friendly warning. Are you
aware that your engines are overheating?
ARCHER: So are yours.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: We have no quarrel with you. Give us the
Vulcan and you'll be free to go.
ARCHER: I have a better idea. Why don't you slow down before your
engines explode?
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Why would you risk the lives of your crew for
this criminal?
ARCHER: I've been ordered to deliver her safely to the Vulcans, and
that's exactly what I plan to do. (Hoshi ends the transmission)
TRAVIS: They're increasing speed. Warp four point nine five.
REED: They're re-entering weapons range, sir.
ARCHER: Archer to Engineering.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Please tell me you're ready to slow down.
ARCHER [OC]: Sorry Trip, but we need a little more speed.
TUCKER: I don't know how much more I can give you.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: It's called a warp five engine.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: On paper.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: We don't have any choice, Trip.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Aye, sir.
 [Bridge]
(Archer stands and gestures to his chair.)
 ARCHER: Ambassador. (she sits) Warp five.
TRAVIS: Four point nine three, nine five.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Don't take your eyes off that antimatter
stream.
CREWWOMAN: Yes, sir.
(Everything is rattling, and smoke is coming out of vents.)
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Four point nine seven.
REED: They're matching our speed.
TRAVIS: Four point nine nine. Warp five. (Big vibrations start.)
REED: They're still gaining on us.
ARCHER: How far to the Vulcan ship?
T'POL: Their jamming signal is disrupting our sensors as well.
ARCHER: Then use their last known position and do the math. Take a
guess.
T'POL: If we could maintain our present speed, approximately fifty
three minutes.
REED: The Mazarites will be in firing range long before then.
ARCHER: What if we could get a message through? Tell them to get here
as fast as they can.
T'POL: The Sh'Raan is capable of warp seven. If we could maintain warp
five we'd reach them in twelve minutes.
ARCHER: Hoshi, any way you can get a message through the interference?
HOSHI: I don't see how, sir.
V'LAR: There's a diplomatic frequency we sometimes use. It's in a lower
subspace band. I doubt the Mazarites are aware of it. (V'Lar goes to Hoshi's
comm. board.) V'LAR: It's been a few years since I did this.
ARCHER: If we do get a message through to the Vulcans, we don't want
the Mazarites to see them coming.
REED: We could try deflecting their jamming signal, sir. Use it to
blind their sensors as well.
ARCHER: See what you can do.
REED: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: Hoshi?
HOSHI: We may have gotten a message through to them, sir, but I'm not
sure.
T'POL: Wouldn't they respond?
 [Engineering]
 (Lights flicker. The smoke from the vents has
turned to flames.)
TUCKER: Tucker to the Bridge!
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Go ahead.
TUCKER [OC]: The port injectors just blew!
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: We've got to slow down, Captain!
CREWMAN: (with fire extinguisher) I got it, I got it.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Hoshi?
HOSHI: The comm. just went down, sir.
TRAVIS: They're right on top of us.
ARCHER: How long?
T'POL: Eight minutes. (Big bang.)
REED: That's a direct hit to our starboard nacelle.
TRAVIS: We're dropping to impulse.
HOSHI: They're hailing us.
ARCHER: How long now?
T'POL: If they received our message, another ten minutes.
ARCHER: I thought it was down to eight.
T'POL: That was before we dropped out of warp.
REED: We can't hold off those ships for that long.
V'LAR: You've done your best, Captain, and I thank you for it, but it's
time for me to turn myself over to them.
ARCHER: We just need to buy ten more minutes.
V'LAR: Captain.
ARCHER: I want you to go to Sickbay.
V'LAR: Sickbay?
ARCHER: I'll explain later. If there was ever a time to start trusting
us, this would be it. (V'Lar leaves.) ARCHER: Put him through.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Give us the Vulcan.
ARCHER: You know, I honestly didn't think you'd be able to catch us.
Just out of curiosity, how fast do your ships go?
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Put her on a shuttle and bring her to our lead
vessel.
ARCHER: That could be a problem. Our shuttlebay was damaged, thanks to
you. I doubt we could launch a shuttlepod until it's repaired. What,
what would you have topped out at? Warp five point five? Warp six? I
can't imagine that you can do much more than that. It seemed like your
engines were starting to run pretty hot.
CAPTAIN [on viewscreen]: Prepare to be boarded. (Ends transmission.)
ARCHER: Malcolm, I'm counting on you. T'Pol.
 [Starboard docking hatch]
 (A Mazarite shuttle has arrived.)
ARCHER: Okay.
CAPTAIN: Where is she?
ARCHER: Your last attack blew out systems across half the ship. Power's
down in Engineering. A plasma conduit exploded on E deck.
CAPTAIN: I didn't ask for a damage report. Where is she?
ARCHER: I was getting to that. Her quarters are on E deck. She was no
more than ten metres away when the conduit blew.
T'POL: Her injuries are extensive. Plasma burns, neurological trauma.
CAPTAIN: I want to see her.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: This is Doctor Phlox.
CAPTAIN: The Vulcan?
PHLOX: She's undergoing dermal regeneration.
CAPTAIN: Open it.
PHLOX: I will not. I don't know what business you have with this woman,
but when she was brought in here she became my patient. If I remove her
from the imaging chamber prematurely, she'll die.
(The two Mazarite henchmen draw their weapons.)
CAPTAIN: Open it. (his communicator beeps) Yes?
MAZARITE [OC]: Our sensors just went down, Captain.
CAPTAIN: What's causing it?
MAZARITE [OC]: Enterprise is redirecting our jamming signal. (The
Captain steps back and the henchmen move forward.)
PHLOX: No! (Archer pulls him out of the line of fire as they shoot at
the imaging chamber. The display above switches to 'System Failure diag
ID 1010'. Enterprise shakes slightly.)
CAPTAIN: Report. Answer me, what's
going on?
ARCHER: I imagine they have their hands full right about now. (Against
the laws of physics, weapons fire is heard hitting the Mazarite ships.)
ARCHER: I believe that's the Sh'Raan. She's a Vulcan combat cruiser. One of
their most powerful, if I'm not mistaken.
HOSHI [OC]: Sir, the Captain of the Sh'Raan wants to speak to you.
ARCHER: Put it up.
VULCAN [on monitor]: Captain Archer, are you in any danger?
ARCHER: You could say that.
VULCAN [on monitor]: Tell the Mazarites to turn their weapons over
immediately or we'll destroy their ships. (T'Pol takes the guns) We'll
be standing by, Captain.
ARCHER: Thank you. (Transmission ends.)
CAPTAIN: We did what we came to do. That's all that matters. (He turns to
leave, but the doors open to reveal -)
V'LAR: I am sorry to disappoint you. I look forward to adding this
incident to my testimony at your trial.
 Captain's starlog, February 9, 2152. The Vulcans
have allowed the Mazarites to leave. Ambassador V'Lar says there's a
good reason for doing so, though she's certainly not sharing it with
me.
 [Docking hatch]
 (The hatch opens to show two Vulcans, who bow
slightly to V'Lar.)
V'LAR: Someday I'd like to walk into a room without it seeming like a
state visit.
ARCHER: Occupational hazard?
V'LAR: (to the Vulcans) I'll be along in a moment. (They leave.) V'LAR: Thank
you, Captain. I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you and your crew.
ARCHER: We're glad we could help.
V'LAR: I sense a great bond between you. A bond of trust and respect,
but also a bond of friendship. I think it bodes well for the future
relations of our two peoples. (She holds out her hand for a shake.)
ARCHER: Goodbye, Ambassador.
V'LAR: (to T'Pol) Live long, and prosper. (T'Pol bows slightly and
V'Lar leaves.)

Desert
Crossing
 Mission date: Feb 12, 2152
Original Airdate: 8 May, 2002

Captain's personal log, February 12, 2152. After a brief detour, we're
back on course for Risa. Everyone's looking forward to some much needed
shore leave.
 [Archer's quarters]
 ARCHER: I've got my eye on a place called Suraya
Bay. Villas built right into the cliffs. A perfect spot to enjoy a few
good books. Might even do a little diving when I (comm. beep) Computer,
pause. Archer.
T'POL [OC]: We're picking up a distress call, Captain. It's coming from
a vessel approximately two light years to port.
ARCHER: Any idea who it is?
T'POL [OC]: No, sir. Should we alter course?
ARCHER: Go ahead. I'll be right there. (to Porthos) Looks like your
walk on the beach will have to wait.
 [Corridor]
(Archer is talking with a tall humanoid in flowing robes, with a
strange tattoo on the chin.)  ZOBRAL: Plasma residue?
ARCHER: Your warp injectors were full of it.
ZOBRAL: I must be more diligent about routine maintenance.
ARCHER: Unless you enjoy being adrift in the middle of nowhere.
ZOBRAL: I'm sorry to inconvenience you something this trivial. Be sure
to thank Mister Tucker for his time.
ARCHER: He wanted me to thank you. It isn't every day he gets to tinker
with alien engines. We also found a microfracture on your starboard
hull. They're sealing it now.
ZOBRAL: Oh, your crew is very thorough.
ARCHER: We were glad to help.
ZOBRAL: Do you answer every distress call you pick up?
ARCHER: If we can.
ZOBRAL: The galaxy could use more people like you.
 [Shuttlepod bay]
 ZOBRAL: Tomorrow you'll join me in my home. Bring
Commander Tucker. I'll prepare a meal in your honour. It's the least I
can do to show my gratitude.
ARCHER: That's very generous, but I promised my crew a trip to Risa.
ZOBRAL: That can wait one more day, can't it?
ARCHER: If I put them off much longer, I'm going to have a mutiny on my
hands.
ZOBRAL: There's going to be a Geskana match. I doubt you've ever seen
anything like it.
ARCHER: Geskana?
ZOBRAL: Yes. You might want to participate, assuming you enjoy
competition. I should warn you, Captain, I am easily offended.
ARCHER: Send me the coordinates. I'll break the news to my crew.
ZOBRAL: Dress for warm weather.
(A little later, Zobral leaves in his repaired shuttle.)
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: If it's all the same to you, Captain I'll
sit this one out.
ARCHER: It's not like you to pass up an away mission.
TUCKER: Well, I'm up to my ears in work. The impulse manifolds need to
be purged, the gravity plating on C deck still isn't aligned.
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: Desert, sir? The heat, the dry air. You know how it sucks the
life out of me.
ARCHER: What about the two weeks we spent in Australia? We had a great
time.
TUCKER: Survival training in the outback? Drinking recycled sweat and
eating snake meat? That's your idea of a great time?
ARCHER: It's not going to be like that. I get the feeling Zobral's a
man who likes to indulge his guests. He's promised to roll out the red
carpet for us. It'll be more fun than purging impulse manifolds. Well,
suit yourself. I'll see if Malcolm's interested. But I was hoping you'd
enjoy spending some time with your captain.
TUCKER: Promise I won't have to eat any snake meat?
 [Shuttlepod]
 (Landing on a very desert planet.)
TUCKER: It's hotter than hell out there. Forty one degrees.
ARCHER: It's a dry heat.
(He opens the hatch and they get out.)
 [Encampment]
 ZOBRAL: Welcome.
ARCHER: Good to be here. You remember Commander Tucker.
ZOBRAL: Yes, of course, of course. This is the man who repaired my
ship. A brilliant engineer.
TUCKER: It was just a couple of clogged injectors.
ZOBRAL: Oh, you are far too modest. Well, I hope you're hungry. I've
prepared quite a feast.
 [Zobral's house]
 (Eating dinner sitting cross-legged at a hourglass
shaped low wooden table.)
ZOBRAL: Are there many deserts on your world?
ARCHER: Quite a few, but none as big as this one.
TUCKER: From orbit, you'd think the entire planet's nothing but sand.
ZOBRAL: Oh well, we have a handful of lakes and small seas. What about
Earth?
TUCKER: Two thirds water.
ZOBRAL: Extraordinary. More wine?
ARCHER: Please.
TUCKER: What's that called again?
ZOBRAL: Yalasat. It's made from a cactus that grows in the northern
foothills. How was your roast teracaq?
ARCHER: It's very good. When Trip and I did our survival training, in
the desert, we never ate this well.
TUCKER: I must have lost about three kilos during that last week. The
heat always takes away my appetite.
ARCHER: Doesn't seem to be bothering you now.
TUCKER: I guess I'm getting acclimated.
ZOBRAL: It must be difficult adjusting to new cultures.
ARCHER: It's challenging at times, but that's why we're out here.
ZOBRAL: Did you ever think of turning back?
ARCHER: Only once. We were attacked by a hostile species with a lot
more firepower than Enterprise. I set a course back to Earth to upgrade
our weapons, but we ended up having to do the repairs ourselves.
TUCKER: They haven't bothered us since.
ZOBRAL: Sounds like you've had an eventful journey.
ARCHER: It's had its share of surprises.
ZOBRAL: Well, perhaps your visit here will be one of them. (more dishes
are brought in) Oh, you're going to enjoy this.
TUCKER: Looks delicious. What is it?
ZOBRAL: Blood soup. I don't usually eat this well but I promised your
Captain an exceptional meal.
TUCKER: What are these little chunks?
ZOBRAL: The essence of the male, chopped, and seasoned.
(The pair are polite but wary as they taste.)
ARCHER: Beautiful tapestries.
ZOBRAL: Thank you. Which do you prefer?
ARCHER: That one's interesting.
ZOBRAL: It's yours.
ARCHER: No, no, no. I couldn't.
ZOBRAL: Please. Consider it a gift.
ARCHER: You're far too generous. Besides, I wouldn't have any place to
hang it.
ZOBRAL: Something smaller then. (Zobral picks up a figurine.) ZOBRAL: I know you will
appreciate this. A Suliban made it. A Suliban I met several years ago.
Interesting people, don't you agree?
ARCHER: Thank you. (A gong sounds.)
ZOBRAL: The Geskana match is about to begin. I'm hoping
you will honour us by participating.
TUCKER: Now? I just ate half a teracaq.
ZOBRAL: You will be glad you did. Geskana requires a great deal of
strength.
 [Encampment]
 (Geskana is a form of lacrosse, with the goal
being a hole in a doughnut. Instead of a net in the racket, it's a
carved bowl, the ball is luminous blue and disintegrates as it passes
through the goal forcefield. Zobral scores.)
ZOBRAL: Think you're ready?
TUCKER: I'll give it a shot, Captain.
ARCHER: I can't promise we'll win any trophies.
ZOBRAL: This is an ideal game for men like you.
ARCHER: Thanks. (They remove their hats, sunglasses and tops, and join
the game.)
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: We're being hailed.
T'POL: The Captain?
HOSHI: No. It's coming from a city on the far side of the desert.
T'POL: Put it through. This is Enterprise.
TRELLIT [on viewscreen]: Several hours ago, you launched a small vessel
to an encampment in the Cygniai Expanse. Would you tell me why?
T'POL: Our Captain and Chief Engineer were invited.
TRELLIT [on viewscreen]: By whom?
T'POL: A man named Zobral. And you are?
TRELLIT [on viewscreen]: Chancellor Trellit. Why are you in contact
with this man?
T'POL: His ship was damaged and we assisted him. In return, he offered
his hospitality.
TRELLIT [on viewscreen]: Hospitality? I hope you're aware that most
likely you'll never see your Captain or Engineer again.
 [Encampment]
 (Trip is sent head over heels by a tackle. Archer
helps him up.)
ARCHER: You all right?
TUCKER: Never better.
(The game resumes with vigour.)
VOICES: Open, open up. Block out. Here, here. Here, here. Get in front
of him. Cut him off. Now.
(Archer shoots for goal but Zobral body-checks him.)
ZOBRAL: So close.
TUCKER: Two centimetres to the right and you'd have had it.
ARCHER: Next time I'll set you up with a no-look pass.
TUCKER: All right.
ARCHER: (communicator chirps) Archer.
T'POL [OC]: I need to speak to you, Captain.
ARCHER: Can it wait? We're a little busy at the moment.
T'POL [OC]: It's urgent. Are you alone?
ARCHER: Hold on a minute. (to Zobral) It's my Science Officer. She says
it's important. Do you mind?
ZOBRAL: Take your time. (He walks away and speaks to the other players.) ZOBRAL: Catch
your breath.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: What's the problem?
T'POL: I've been contacted by a government official in a city about two
hundred kilometres from where you are now. He claims that you're in
danger.
 [Encampment]
 ARCHER: What kind of danger?
T'POL [OC]: According to him
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Zobral and his men are terrorists.
 [Encampment]
 T'POL [OC]: They've been responsible for numerous
attacks on civilian targets within the city.
ARCHER: Maybe I'm wrong, but they don't seem like terrorists to me.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Perhaps not, but until we're certain who
they are, I suggest you return to the ship.
 [Encampment]
 ARCHER: We're on our way. (Ends transmission.)
ZOBRAL: I hope everything is all right.
ARCHER: The problem with being a starship captain is you're never
really off duty. I'm afraid we have to cut our visit short.
ZOBRAL: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
TUCKER: hat's going on?
ARCHER: Problem with the starboard engine. T'Pol says she needs us up
there right away.
TUCKER: Can't we at least finish this quarter?
ARCHER: Remember those impulse manifolds you said needed purging? You
were right.
TUCKER: Well, thanks for one hell of a game.
ZOBRAL: You must have other people that can correct this problem.
ARCHER: I wish we did.
ZOBRAL: As I said, Captain, I am easily offended.
ARCHER: We'll come back if there's time, I promise.
ZOBRAL: (suddenly very angry) You should not believe the Torothans. I
have just been informed that we picked up a lengthy transmission
between your vessel and Chancellor Trellit. Whatever he told your
Science Officer it is not true. I wanted this to wait till later, but I
beg you, let me explain the real reason why I asked you here. You have
a reputation for being fair, a man of great integrity. When you hear
what I have to say, I am certain you will want to help us.
 [Zobral's House]
(Zobral holds up a garment.)  ZOBRAL: It is called a yrott.
The word means to stand apart. When we lived in the cities we were
forced to wear these whenever we walked in public.
ARCHER: I take it those days are over.
ZOBRAL: When the caste system was finally abolished, we were led to
believe that everyone would be treated equally. I remember the
celebrations. Yrotts being burned in the streets. People saying that we
had finally been granted our rights. The Torothan Clan signed the
accord, but they never abided by it. They still control the government,
the lands, the resources, everything. We spent ten years staging
protests, appealing to the courts, until finally we realised there was
only one way to get their attention. We have hundreds of camps just
like this one all across the desert, and we are going to keep attacking
the Torothans until our voices are heard. They call us terrorists, but
the truth is they have been terrorising us for centuries.
ARCHER: You said you brought me down here for a reason. I have a
feeling it wasn't to hear a history lesson.
ZOBRAL: The Torothans have ten times as many soldiers as we do. We
won't last much longer without your help.
ARCHER: I really don't see what I can do for you.
ZOBRAL: They said you would be humble. I scanned your vessel. You have
an arsenal of powerful weapons, but more importantly, I need your
wisdom. Our current strategy isn't working, but I am confident that
together we can find one that does. I would be honoured to fight
alongside you, as would all of my men.
(There is a big bang outside.)
TUCKER: What the hell was that?
ZOBRAL: Torothan cruisers. Usually they begin their bombardment after
dark. They're getting started early today. (Weapons are taken from a rack.)
ARCHER: I don't know what you've
heard about me, but I think you've been misled.
ZOBRAL: What about the Suliban?
ARCHER: What about them?
ZOBRAL: You liberated a detention camp, freed thousands of prisoners.
TUCKER: Who told you that?
ZOBRAL: A Suliban transport captain. He told me of an explorer who was
also a great warrior. A man who helped them defeat an entire army.
Captain Jonathan Archer.
YOUNG MAN: Two cruisers, sir. They've hit one of our pulse cannons.
ZOBRAL: Prepare my ship. This won't last more than a few hours. We'll
continue this discussion later. (Zobral throws a rug aside and opens up a
cellar trapdoor.) ZOBRAL You'll be safe here.
TUCKER: If it's all the same to you, we'd rather get back to Enterprise.
ZOBRAL: Oh, your shuttle's thrusters would draw their attention. You'd
become an easy target. Please. I wouldn't be a very good host if I
allowed you to get killed. (They go into the cellar.)
 [Bridge]
 REED: There's a number of ships strafing the
encampment.
T'POL: Hail the Captain.
ARCHER [OC]: Archer.
T'POL: Captain, are you all right?
ARCHER [OC]: (almost inaudible under static) We've taken shelter.
Should be
HOSHI: That's the best I can give you. The entire region is flooded
with jamming signals.
TRAVIS: Well, we can't just leave them down there. What about the
transporter?
REED: I can't localise their biosigns. I'll take a shuttlepod and find
them myself.
T'POL: In the middle of an assault? (to Hoshi) See if you can find
Chancellor Trellit.
 [Zobral's cellar]
 ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise. Enterprise. Respond.
(gives up) Rough game.
TUCKER: That damn midfielder knocked me down three times during the
last quarter. I must've bruised half a dozen ribs.
ARCHER: Better have Doctor Phlox take a look at it when we get back.
(Another explosion pours sand through the ceiling)
TUCKER: So, does the great warrior have any ideas about how we're
getting out of here? You're not thinking about helping these people?
ARCHER: I was thinking about those Suliban prisoners. If we hadn't
helped them escape, we wouldn't be in this situation.
TUCKER: T'Pol's ears must be burning. Want your Chief Engineer's
advice?
ARCHER: What is it?
TUCKER: Walk away. They lured us down here under false pretenses, and
now they're asking us to help them fight a war? That's a lot different
than breaking a few innocent people out of prison.
ARCHER: There's just one problem. Zobral. I get the feeling he's not
going to take no for an answer. (A very close detonation brings the
cellar door down on Archer.) ARCHER: Come on.
 [Encampment]
 (They emerge to discover Zobral's house has been
destroyed and the encampment is on fire.)
TUCKER: I don't know about you, but I'd rather take my chances out in
that desert.
ARCHER: I thought you hated the desert.
TUCKER: Not tonight.
(They dash to the shuttlepod for supplies, and then make their getaway.)
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: You neglected to mention that you'd be
attacking the encampment.
TRELLIT [on viewscreen]: And you assured me your people would be
leaving the surface. Why didn't they?
T'POL: Captain Archer wanted to speak with Zobral.
TRELLIT [on viewscreen]: Interesting. Where are they now?
T'POL: I don't know. If you'd be willing to end your assault, we could
launch a search party.
TRELLIT [on viewscreen]: You expect us to stand by while you send more
people to join Zobral?
T'POL: If you believe we're assisting the terrorists, you're mistaken.
TRELLIT [on viewscreen]: Of course, I forgot. They just went down for
the hospitality.
T'POL: Let us find them and we'll leave immediately.
TRELLIT [on viewscreen]: That's what you promised before. We'll locate
your men ourselves and deal with them accordingly. That's assuming they
haven't already been killed.
T'POL: Chancellor.
TRELLIT [on viewscreen]: If you attempt to launch another shuttlecraft,
we'll have no choice but to consider it as an enemy vessel. (Ends
transmission.)
REED: I've lost sensor contact with the surface. Some kind of orbital
dispersion field. I can't get any readings below a hundred kilometres.
 [Desert]
 (A perfect blue sky, pale pink sand dunes stretching
for ever with Archer and Trip following a sharp wind-cut ridge.)
TUCKER: Two men out in the open. You'd think they would have spotted us
by now. We're down here!
ARCHER: You're going to have to yell a little louder than that.
TUCKER: You sure we're going in the right direction?
ARCHER: It was east of the camp. We're heading east.
TUCKER: How far?
ARCHER: About thirty kilometres.
TUCKER: Thirty? What if we find more of Zobral's men inside?
ARCHER: It looked abandoned.
TUCKER: All I saw was sand. I don't remember any buildings.
ARCHER: That's because you forgot your survival training. Take a good
look on your way in at your surroundings.
TUCKER: Didn't they also say something about only walking at night?
Can't we wait until it cools down a little? ARCHER: That could be for
another eight or nine hours. We need to find shelter.
TUCKER: Twenty minutes, Captain.
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: Ten? (He falls to his knees.) TUCKER: To cherry-flavoured snow cones. What
I wouldn't give for one right about now. (They take a sip of water.) TUCKER: You
hear that?
ARCHER: What?
TUCKER: It sounds like a ship.
ARCHER: I think the heat's getting to you.
TUCKER: No, listen. Over there. A shuttlepod?
ARCHER: No. Something a lot bigger.
(When the alien ship flies over, the pair have covered themselves in
sand for camouflage.)
ARCHER: You all right?
TUCKER: Yeah.
 [Situation room]
 REED: The dispersion field covers half the
continent, but if I disable these three satellites, I think I can get a
clear reading of the eastern desert.
T'POL: That might provoke the Torothans. I suggest you try to find a
less intrusive way to penetrate their defenses.
HOSHI: Why Montana? Of all the places the Vulcans could have landed
they chose Bozeman, Montana.
T'POL: Humanity's first warp drive was developed there. It seemed a
logical place to begin.
HOSHI: Well, how did they know it wouldn't alarm other nations? An
alien species makes contact with the United States. It could have made
a lot of other countries nervous.
T'POL: What's your point?
HOSHI: It seems to me that we're going to run into similar problems. We
get invited to dinner, and before you know it we're accused of taking
sides in a war.
T'POL: Contacting new worlds always involves unexpected risks. The High
Command has very specific protocols regarding planetary conflicts.
Eventually, Captain Archer will have to create some directives of his
own.
 [Desert]
 (One dune ridge looks exactly like another except
for the lack of footprints, then Tucker collapses.)
ARCHER: Come on. Come on. We got to keep moving. Come on.
TUCKER: My shift doesn't begin for another six hours.
ARCHER: We're almost there.
TUCKER: Where? Where are we going? ARCHER: Nice little place I know.
Plenty of shade.
TUCKER: Are there blankets down there? I'm freezing.
ARCHER: Heat exhaustion. Here. Come here. (He makes Tucker drink.) ARCHER: Here. There
you go. Easy, easy. (But the bottle's empty.) ARCHER: Here take mine. Go ahead.
TUCKER: No, sir. I won't take another man's water.
ARCHER: You drink it. That's an order.
TUCKER: Got to keep moving.
ARCHER: Take the water, or I'll knock you on your ass and pour it down
your throat. Easy. (Tucker drinks, and empties that one too.)
TUCKER: Thanks.
 [Bridge]
 REED: There's a vessel approaching from the
surface. It's Zobral.
HOSHI: He's hailing us.
ZOBRAL [OC]: Open your launch doors, quickly.
T'POL: Is the Captain with you? Commander Tucker?
ZOBRAL [OC]: No, no. I'll explain once I'm aboard.
T'POL: Where are they?
ZOBRAL [OC]: If I'm not in your docking bay in the next thirty seconds,
I'll be detected. They'll destroy my ship.
T'POL: Bring him in.
 [Launch bay]
 ZOBRAL: How many?
REED: There were eighty nine. There were only eighty nine Suliban, not
thousands.
ZOBRAL: And the army you defeated?
REED: I would hardly call it an army. It was more like a few dozen
prison guards, and to be honest they didn't put up much of a fight.
T'POL: Jonathan Archer is an excellent starship captain, but he's
hardly the invincible warrior described to you.
ZOBRAL: What about his legendary desert tactics?
REED: Actually, I'm the tactical officer on this ship, and I don't have
any experience at waging desert warfare. I'm afraid you've come to the
wrong people for help.
ZOBRAL: All this for nothing.
T'POL: What about our people?
ZOBRAL: You have far better sensors than we do. I'm sure you'll find
them.
T'POL: Our sensors are being disrupted and the Torothans have
threatened to fire on us if we launch a shuttlepod.
REED: How did you get here without them seeing you?
ZOBRAL: There was a narrow gap in their orbital detection grid. It
occurs once every forty six minutes, but it is only open for less than
one minute.
REED: I'll need all the pertinent data.
ZOBRAL: Ha! You'll need more than that. The manoeuvres are extremely
difficult. It took us years to learn them.
REED: I'm a quick study.
ZOBRAL: You will be shot down before you reach the atmosphere.
T'POL: With you at the helm our chances would improve.
ZOBRAL: I don't have time. My men are waiting for me.
REED: Then they'll have to wait a little longer. You're the one that
got our people stranded down there.
ZOBRAL: They are not my responsibility!
T'POL: You're mistaken. The Torothans believe we've joined your cause.
If Captain Archer and Commander Tucker are apprehended, they'll
undoubtedly be treated as members of your clan. They'll become victims
of the same oppression you've been fighting all these years. You should
feel as responsible for those two men as you do for your own.
 [Desert - ruins]
 (Finally, two ruined buildings come into view. The
pair get there and settle down in the comparative shade.)
ARCHER: Easy.
TUCKER: Home, sweet home. (Archer finds a metal bowl with some water in
it, and a ladle.) TUCKER: I hope you're not planning to hog that all for
yourself.
ARCHER: (sniffs and recoils) Water's off the menu.
TUCKER: Now, this is my idea of a great time.
(Tater, Archer has got a fire going and is ladling water into a bottle.)
TUCKER: What'd you do, rub two sticks together?
ARCHER: I found a new use for the stun setting. It may not taste too
good, but I think I boiled away anything that can hurt us.
TUCKER: No thanks. I'm not thirsty.
ARCHER: Let's not get into that argument again. (Tucker takes a mouthful and spits it out.)
TUCKER: Worse than blood soup.
ARCHER: You need water.
TUCKER: What I need is sleep.
ARCHER: You've got a fever, Trip. Your heart's racing, you've got all
the symptoms of heatstroke. If you fall asleep, you could lapse into a
coma.
TUCKER: A coma? That sounds nice.
ARCHER: When we get back to Enterprise you can sleep all you want, but
right now, you got to stay with me and drink this water. If I had a
needle I'd give it you intravenously, but I don't. Come on, sit up.
Here you go. Good. Commander.
TUCKER: Aye, Captain.
ARCHER: The warp reactor. Break it down for me.
TUCKER: What?
ARCHER: What are the eight major components?
TUCKER: You got to be kidding me.
ARCHER: Name them. That's an order.
TUCKER: Well, there's the drumsticks, thighs, wings. You got anything
to eat around here?
ARCHER: Not at the moment, but when we get back to Enterprise I'll have
Chef make you a dinner you'll never forget. What would you like?
Anything.
TUCKER: Not snake meat.
ARCHER: No, Chef doesn't do snake very well. Tell me what you want.
TUCKER: Prime rib.
ARCHER: Okay, what else?
TUCKER: Mashed potatoes with mushroom gravy. The kind he makes on
Wednesday nights.
ARCHER: No problem. What kind of vegetables? Hey, vegetables?
TUCKER: Broccoli.
ARCHER: Dessert?
TUCKER: Pecan pie.
 [Shuttlepod]
 (Flying low at night, search light scouring the
sand.)
ZOBRAL: Take another pass over the eastern basin.
T'POL: Our sensors would have detected them.
ZOBRAL: No, there's magnetic deposits below that basin. They could be
masking their biosigns.
REED: (doing the flying) If we increased our altitude this would go a
lot faster.
ZOBRAL: We would also risk being detected.
 [Desert - ruins]
 (Trip is given some more water, but he's barely
conscious.)
ARCHER: Geography. Do you know how to play?
TUCKER: Geography?
ARCHER: You know, you say Amazon River, which ends in an R and then I
say Rhode Island.
TUCKER: We're going to Rhode Island?
ARCHER: No. No, it's a game. You're supposed to tell me some place that
starts with a D.
TUCKER: Oh, D. Er, Draylax.
ARCHER: X? X.
TUCKER: There's always
ARCHER: No, no, don't tell me. I know an X. Xanadu.
TUCKER: That's not a real place.
ARCHER: It doesn't matter.
TUCKER: Of course it matters.
ARCHER: You just used an alien planet, Draylax. (Tucker starts coughing,
so Archer gives him more water.) ARCHER: Easy, easy, easy, Easy, easy. (A light
flashes overhead, then there's an explosion.)
TUCKER: All right, whatever you say. Xanadu's fine.
Archer looks out of a window at a bright object heading towards them
- a missile.) ARCHER: Get your head down!
TUCKER: What?
ARCHER: Get down!
(There is a very close bang and more of the ruins fall down.)
ARCHER: We got to get out of here. Come on.
 [Shuttlepod]
 REED: I'm picking up weapons fire on the surface.
Ninety kilometres due south.
ZOBRAL: A Torothan mortar.
T'POL: Would they be targeting one of your settlements?
ZOBRAL: We don't have any near there.
T'POL: Set a course and prepare to fire. I believe they've located the
Captain and Commander Tucker.
 [Desert]
 (A mortar makes a direct hit on the ruins, but the
pair are safely out.)
ARCHER: Come on. Come on.
 [Shuttlepod]
 REED: I've got a lock.
T'POL: Fire.
(The mortar position blows up.)
T'POL: I see them. Two humans bearing one one five mark three.
 [Desert]
 (A light from above blinds them to its source.)
TUCKER: I'm just slowing you down. Go.
ARCHER: I don't remember taking orders from you. (He puts down Tucker and
gets out his phase pistol, then sees that it's the shuttlepod coming in
to land, picks Tucker up again and heads for it. T'Pol helps Tucker in and
sees to him while Zobral extends his arm to Archer.)
 [Launch bay]
 ZOBRAL: My launch window opens in nine minutes. I
should be going. I hope Commander Tucker is going to be all right.
ARCHER: I doubt I'll ever convince him to set foot on another desert,
but he'll be fine. Zobral, even if I were the warrior you thought I
was, that's not why we're out here.
ZOBRAL: Captain. Sub-Commander. (Zubral goes to his shuttle.)
 [Corridor]
 T'POL: What you told him was correct. Decisions to
get involved in the conflicts of other worlds should be left to
governments, and not starship captains.
ARCHER: I know. The irony is, I have the feeling his cause is worth
fighting for.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Two Days And Two Nights
Two Days
And Two Nights
 Mission date: Feb 18, 2152
Original Airdate: 15 May, 2002

Captain's personal log February 18, 2152. It took a while, but we've
finally made it to Risa. With any luck, this'll be my last log entry
for the next two days.
 [Deleted scene - Mess hall]
 (In orbit of Risa.)
RISAN: It'd be a shame to deprive any of your people.
ARCHER: We appreciate your hospitality, but a minimal number of
crewmembers need to stay on board.
RISAN: If you add a few days to your stay, you could give everyone a
chance to enjoy themselves. The additional charge would be minimal.
ARCHER: It's tempting, but we need to keep some dilithium to run our
engines.
RISAN: Don't be so sure. After two days and nights on Risa you may
never want to leave. I see your crew has chosen a wide variety of
locales and activities that should keep them very entertained, but I
see you won't be joining us, Sub-Commander.
T'POL: I've visited Risa before. It seemed appropriate to give someone
else a chance.
RISAN: Well, I'm sorry. As I'm sure you remember, we have many
diversions designed for our Vulcan guests.
TUCKER: So, this covers everything?
RISAN: The package is all-inclusive.
TUCKER: Everything? You know, food, drinks, souvenirs.
RISAN: Trust me, Mister Tucker. (takes dilithium container) No one will
go away disappointed.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER: (in casual clothes) If anything happens,
you know where to reach me.
T'POL: I don't anticipate any problems.
ARCHER: Well, it's the problems you don't anticipate.
T'POL: The crew is trained to handle emergencies, but I'll alert you
immediately if there are any problems.
(They arrive at the turbolift.)
ARCHER: This doesn't feel right. I shouldn't be going down to some
pleasure planet while half the crew has to stay onboard.
T'POL: Everyone drew lots. You had the same chance as the others.
ARCHER: All the same the crew should come first.
T'POL: Captain, you need a vacation.
(Porthos runs in and gazes at his master. Archer follows.)
 [Launch bay]
(Hoshi has let her hair down, and is wearing a red
dress.)
 HOSHI: I'm glad you decided to take some time off,
sir.
ARCHER: Wouldn't miss it.
ROSTOV: Do you want to take the helm, Captain?
ARCHER: I'm on vacation.
(Rostov takes his bag.)
ARCHER: Thanks.
T'POL: Enjoy yourselves.
(Tucker is in that Hawaiian shirt.)
TUCKER: I'll bring you a souvenir.
(The two shuttlepods launch.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER: Everyone have big plans? Travis?
(Wearing a bright checked shirt and huge grin.)
TRAVIS: Rock-climbing, sir. There's a place called Galartha. The cliff
face changes pitch while you climb it.
HOSHI: That sounds kind of dangerous.
TRAVIS: Well, if it's easy, what's the point?
ARCHER: Just watch yourself. Malcolm.
(In a plain burgundy shirt.)
REED: Well, supposedly Risa's very cosmopolitan. There are species
visiting from all over.
TUCKER: Malcolm and I plan to broaden our cultural horizons.
HOSHI: Is that all you two think about?
TUCKER: Well, how we choose to relax is our own business.
ARCHER: You watch yourselves, too.
HOSHI: I plan on doing something constructive with my time. I have been
relying on the universal translator far too much. Before I left Earth,
I learned thirty eight languages and now all I do is push a button and
the computer does all the work.
ROSTOV: Isn't that what it's for?
HOSHI: Not this time. I left my translator on Enterprise.
TUCKER: You only have two days, Hoshi. If you want to waste your time
talking to people.
TRAVIS: What about you, Captain?
ARCHER: I've never been much for vacations, but I've got a little villa
overlooking the ocean, and Porthos and I are going to relax.
 [Sickbay]
 T'POL: How long will this last?
PHLOX: I usually require six days per year, but two should leave me
sufficiently refreshed.
CUTLER: I've adjusted the dosage to wake you up in exactly forty eight
hours.
T'POL: And if someone should require medical attention during your
hibernation?
PHLOX: Crewman Cutler is a capable medic.
CUTLER: I know where the bandages are.
PHLOX: You can always wake me if you need to, but please, only if it's
an emergency. (Cutler injects him) Well, to bed.
T'POL: Pleasant dreams, Doctor.
 [Archer's villa]
 (Sunlit, airy, plenty of pot plants)
ARCHER: What do you think, Porthos? Not bad.
(He finds a note and a package on a table. The note says 'to help you
relax - T'Pol. The package is a book, the Teachings of Surak, English
translation. He goes onto the balcony overlooking an azure blue bay,
and other villa balconies down the cliff face. A
Hairless Chinese Crested dog is
yipping.)
 [Keyla's balcony]
 KEYLA: Come here, let's go. What are you barking
at?
(A blonde woman with interesting Trill-style spots on her body,
wearing a swimming costume, picks up the hairless dog and gazes up into
Archer's
eyes, then goes indoors.)
 [Club]
 (The boys have changed into different shirts, with
jackets, and are checking out the ladies.)
TUCKER: What about that one?
REED: Now I know you've been cooped up on a starship for too long.
TUCKER: What's wrong with her?
REED: Well, nothing, I suppose. I just wouldn't know which eyes to look
into. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Now, she's interesting.
TUCKER: I don't think she is the right pronoun, but if you think it's
worth the risk.
(He waves at whoever and points at Reed.)
REED: I don't know. Maybe I should have brought my scanner with me.
(He takes drinks from a tray.)
REED: Thank you.
TUCKER: That's a she.
REED: What shall we drink to?
TUCKER: To us, and to a well-earned two days and two nights.
 [Archer's balcony]
 (Reading by the light of two full moons, he goes
inside to refresh his drink and dashes back out when he hears Porthos
barking.  The hairless dog and Porthos are staring at each
other and
growling.)
ARCHER: How'd you get up here? Stop it, you two. Porthos. (doorbell
chimes) Come in!
(Archer picks up Porthos and goes to open the door.)
KEYLA: I'm sorry to bother you, but I think my dog is on your deck.
ARCHER: Please.
KEYLA: There you are.
(She picks up her dog.)
KEYLA: I hope she didn't hurt
ARCHER: Porthos.
KEYLA: Hello, Porthos. She's been cooped up for weeks. I should have
known she'd run off the first chance she got.
ARCHER: No harm done. She probably just came over to make a friend. I'm
Jonathan.
KEYLA: Keyla.
(She holds out her hand and they shake.)
ARCHER: So, is this your first time to Risa?
KEYLA: Yes. You?
ARCHER: First time. My science officer felt I needed to relax so I
decided to do some reading, let Porthos run on the beach.
KEYLA: You should always listen to your science officer.
ARCHER: She'd be the first to agree with you. I was about to go out for
dinner. Can you recommend a restaurant?
KEYLA: There's this little boat that sails into the bay every evening
just after sunset. You wade out, and they serve seafood right off the
deck.
ARCHER: Sounds great.
KEYLA: Well, I'm sorry to disturb you. Thanks again.
ARCHER: If you don't have other plans, maybe we could wade out to that
little boat together.
KEYLA: You're not here with your science officer?
ARCHER: No.
KEYLA: In that case. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I can't tonight.
ARCHER: Just a thought.
KEYLA: Tomorrow?
ARCHER: I look forward to it.
KEYLA: So do I. Goodbye, Porthos.
 [Restaurant]
 (The majority of the dialogue is in Risan with
subtitles.)
HOSHI: Tikara. (Hello)
WOMAN: Tikara.
HOSHI: It's a beautiful night.
MAN: You've obviously never been here before.
HOSHI: Why do you say that?
WOMAN: The nights are always beautiful.
HOSHI: Slowly please. I'm just learning Risan.
WOMAN: Really? Most people wouldn't bother.
HOSHI: When I go someplace I like to learn the language.
WOMAN: How long will you be here?.
HOSHI: Just today and tomorrow.
MAN: You've never spoken Risan before today?.
HOSHI: Na. No. How am I doing?
WOMAN: Exceptionally. You hardly have any accent.
HOSHI: Sara. (Thank you)
WOMAN: It's been nice talking to you.
MAN: We're attending the Festival of the Moons tonight. You should go
if you have the time.
HOSHI: Thank you, I'll try.
WOMAN: Goodnight.
HOSHI: Goodnight.
(The couple leave and a young man comes to Hoshi's
table.)
RAVIS: Ikara. (Hello)
HOSHI: Ikara.
RAVIS: I don't mean to be rude, but I overheard your conversation.
HOSHI: Oh.
RAVIS: You're very adept at languages
HOSHI: It's my job. I'm the Communications Officer on a starship.
Shikara Hoshi. My name is Hoshi
RAVIS: Ravis.
(They shake hands.)
RAVIS: May I? (he sits) How many languages do
you speak?
HOSHI: About forty.
RAVIS: Have you ever heard one you couldn't learn?
HOSHI: Not yet. Klingon was hard. It took me months to master the
conjugations.
RAVIS: Do you think you could learn my language?
HOSHI: Where are you from?
RAVIS: (some complete gobbledygook)
HOSHI: That's the name of your planet? Say it slower.
RAVIS: You can't say it slower. It changes the meaning.
HOSHI: Try it again.
RAVIS: Don't feel bad. My own people can barely speak it properly.
HOSHI: I'm not ready to give up. Will you teach me?
RAVIS: It could take a while. I was about to have dinner. Will you join
me?
 [Club]
 REED: (getting drunk) That place up the street
looked pretty lively.
TUCKER: Well, the Vulcan database said no one leaves this club unhappy.
REED: How would the Vulcans know? They only mate once every seven
years.
TUCKER: That's what they say.
REED: Do you know something I don't?
TUCKER: Come on, seven years? I doubt even T'Pol could hold out that
long.
REED: Oh, she's very disciplined.
TUCKER: Malcolm, bearing one eight zero.
REED: What?
TUCKER: Behind you.
REED: Anything in that database that could help us get a conversation
going?
TUCKER: If you wanted to have a cultural dialogue you should have gone
with Hoshi.
DEE'AHN: (brunette in brown) Hello.
TUCKER: Hello.
DEE'AHN: I'm Dee'Ahn, and this is Latia.
(Another brunette in a floral bra.)
TUCKER: I'm Trip.
REED: I'm Malcolm. Would you join us for a drink?
DEE'AHN: We've been waiting for you to ask.
REED: Well, what would you like?
LATIA: These look good.
TUCKER: (to waitress) Another round, please.
DEE'AHN: So, where are you two from?
REED: Our planet's called Earth.
LATIA: Earth? Never heard of it.
TUCKER: We're sort of new to the neighbourhood.
DEE'AHN: Well, then we'll have to make sure that your first visit to
Risa is memorable.
 [Archer's balcony]
(Keyla is on her own balcony.)
 KEYLA: Jonathan? You're up
late.
ARCHER: Just looking at the stars.
KEYLA: Don't you get enough of that on your ship?
ARCHER: Never.
KEYLA: Will you show me what you're looking at?
ARCHER: Come on up.
(He's looking through a triangular telescope when
she comes in.)
ARCHER: I wanted to thank you. The little boat with the seafood?
Best I've ever had.
KEYLA: I'm sorry you had to eat alone.
ARCHER: No problem. I had a nice chat with a couple from Vega Reticuli.
It turns out it's their three hundredth wedding anniversary.
KEYLA: Well, they must have a lot of stories.
ARCHER: You can't imagine. There it is.
(He gestures to her to look through
the telescope.)
KEYLA: What am I looking for?
ARCHER: See the bright blue star at the top?
KEYLA: Is that your sun?
ARCHER: No, look just below. The yellow one. Do you see it?
KEYLA: It's so faint.
ARCHER: It's about ninety light years from here.
KEYLA: You're a long way from home.
ARCHER: Actually, this is the farthest any of my people have ever gone.
KEYLA: You're an explorer. I wouldn't be surprised if they're naming
schools after you back on your world.
ARCHER: Archer Elementary. It has a nice ring to it. Can you show me
where you're from?
KEYLA: Oh, I really don't have a very good sense of direction.
ARCHER: Oh, I'm sure it's not that bad.
KEYLA: I got lost coming back from the lobby today.
ARCHER: Well, I can see how that could happen. I mean, it's at least a
hundred metres from here.
KEYLA: And all the villas look the same.
ARCHER: You've just got to notice the subtle differences.
KEYLA: Like the numbers on the doors.
ARCHER: Now you're catching on. Give me a couple hours I could have you
navigating a starship.
KEYLA: Why don't you start by telling me about some of the places
you've been. We'll get to the starship navigation later.
 [Club]
 TUCKER: (to Dee'Ahn) We only had a few hours of
air, left so I jettisoned our engine and blew it up. Turned it into a
rescue flare.
REED: It was my idea.
TUCKER: Doesn't matter whose idea it was. It worked.
REED: Why don't you tell them about the time you saved Enterprise in
your underwear.
TUCKER: I saved the captain's life.
LATIA: I thought you were the captain.
TUCKER: We rotate. He's captain next week.
DEE'AHN: So, captains, have you seen the subterranean gardens?
REED: Subterranean?
LATIA: All the plants that grow there are luminescent. It's beautiful.
TUCKER: Maybe you could show us.
 [Club Cellar]
 LATIA: Through here.
REED: This is a strange way to get to the garden.
DEE'AHN: They're very secluded. So, how much do starship captains get
paid on your world?
REED: Excuse me?
LATIA: What kind of valuables do you have?
TUCKER: I think there's been a misunderstanding.
(The girls morph into butch looking aliens with bony ridged faces and
big pointed ears.)
REED: There's definitely been a misunderstanding.
(They try to run but fail.)
ALIEN 1: See what they have.
TUCKER: I hope this isn't their mating ritual.
ALIEN 2: Quiet! Nothing.
ALIEN 1: Maybe they have something back in their rooms.
ALIEN 2: It's too risky. We could sell their clothes.
TUCKER: Listen, I bet we could make some kind of a deal.
(Alien 1 stuns them with his ray gun.)
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Enterprise.
TRAVIS [OC]: It's Travis, Sub-Commander. Could you send a shuttlepod
down?
T'POL: What's the problem, Ensign?
TRAVIS [OC]: I had a little rock-climbing accident.
T'POL: Where are you?
TRAVIS [OC]: In the central hospital, but I really want to get back to
Enterprise.
 [Launch bay]
 (Travis's right leg is in a brace, and he is being
supported by Rostov and Cutler.)
TRAVIS: The fun part is the way the rock face changes. The problem is
the handholds change, too.
T'POL: Why didn't you let them finish treating you on the surface?
TRAVIS: Have you ever been to an alien hospital?
T'POL: Yes, in San Francisco.
TRAVIS: Well, these people have never treated a human before. I wanted
my own doctor. Where's Phlox?
(Cutler gives him a thorough scan.)
CUTLER:
He's not available.
TRAVIS: What do you mean, he's not available?
CUTLER: He's sleeping.
TRAVIS: Well, wake him up. He's got a patient.
T'POL: The doctor is hibernating.
TRAVIS: Hibernating? For how long?
CUTLER: Just a couple of days. Don't worry. I can handle a broken leg.
ROSTOV: He said he was having trouble breathing when we were in the
pod.
CUTLER: Did they give you any medication?
TRAVIS: Just a hypospray for the pain. Is something wrong?
CUTLER: Oh, it's probably nothing. Let's get you to Sickbay.
 [Club Cellar]
 (Daylight streams in through a skylight onto our
boys, now stripped down to their regulation blue skivvies, and tied
hand and foot.)
REED: Morning.
TUCKER: I don't know if it was those Risan mai-tais or getting shot,
but my head's killing me.
REED: It was probably both. The sun's up. We've been down here all
night.
TUCKER: Great. Our shore leave's half over. Hey! We need some help down
here! Hello?
REED: I already tried it. Club's closed.
TUCKER: I don't plan on spending our entire trip tied up in a basement.
REED: The Vulcan database didn't mention anything about crime.
TUCKER: They said it was very rare.
REED: What?
TUCKER: It had some warnings, but I didn't think it'd be a problem.
REED: Wonderful.
TUCKER: You think this is my fault.
REED: You were willing to follow two strange aliens into a basement.
TUCKER: Gorgeous aliens. Don't forget, they were gorgeous.
REED: They were male!
TUCKER: Not at first! I don't remember twisting your arm.
REED: If we don't make it to the loading zone on time, they're going to
start scanning for our biosigns. Do you want the Captain to find us
like this?
 [Sickbay]
 TRAVIS: I feel terrible.
CUTLER: You're having a reaction to the painkiller they gave you.
T'POL: What's his condition?
CUTLER: If the swelling gets any worse, it could begin to constrict his
airway.
T'POL: I've spoken to the hospital. They've never heard of a reaction
like this, but they're not familiar with human physiology.
TRAVIS: I really think we should wake up Doctor Phlox.
 [Restaurant]
 HOSHI: I'm sorry. I give up. I never thought that
I'd hear a language I couldn't learn.
RAVIS: Don't feel bad. You've only been trying for one day.
HOSHI: It only took you one day to pick up English.
RAVIS: It is much simpler, and you are a very good primari.
HOSHI: Teacher.
RAVIS: What do you call this?
(A triangular red fruit.)
HOSHI: Oh, we don't have anything exactly like it. The closest thing
would be a strawberry.
RAVIS: Strawberry. And this?
(She bites into a slice of green fruit.)
HOSHI:
It tastes like a kiwi.
What?
RAVIS: In my language, kee'hwi is, er.
HOSHI: What?
RAVIS: I don't know the word. May I show you?
HOSHI: Sure. Why not?
RAVIS: (kissing her) Kee'hwi.
HOSHI: Kiss. That's called a kiss.
RAVIS: A kiss. There's a place I was planning to go today. A steam
pool. They say it's very relaxing. Would you like to go?
HOSHI: Avec plaisir. That's French.
RAVIS: What does it mean?
(She gets up, holds out her hand and they leave together.)
 [Archer's villa]
 (He's sniffing the fruits in his breakfast when
the doorbell sounds.)
KEYLA: Good morning.
ARCHER: Good morning. Come in.
KEYLA: I thought we could take our dogs to the beach if you don't have
other plans.
ARCHER: Sounds great. I just ordered breakfast. Would you like to join
me?
KEYLA: Certainly.
ARCHER: Juice?
KEYLA: Please. What are you reading?
ARCHER: It's a gift from my science officer. Her people think humans
are too controlled by their emotions.
KEYLA: I knew there was a reason I liked you.
(She looks at his book.)
ARCHER: Seems like you know a lot about me. Where I'm from, what books
I read. I don't even know your dog's name.
KEYLA: It's Rhylo. I adopted her when she was a puppy. Anything else?
ARCHER: Everything else. What's your planet called? What do you do? Do
you have a family?
KEYLA: We've been having such a wonderful time. I really don't want to
spoil it.
ARCHER: How could you spoil it?
KEYLA: I did have a family. They were killed. My parents, my brother,
my husband.
ARCHER: I'm sorry.
KEYLA: It was our own fault. We'd been warned about the Suliban. We
should have gotten out while we had the chance.
ARCHER: Suliban?
KEYLA: You know about them?
ARCHER: Yes.
 [Phlox's quarters]
 CUTLER: I'm not so sure this is a good idea.
T'POL: There's no need to whisper. He's in a state of deep hibernation.
CUTLER: Yeah, that's what I'm worried about.
(She injects Phlox.)
T'POL: Did you use the correct dosage?
PHLOX: (suddenly waking) Do'sani! Do'sani, yo-to aruda!
CUTLER: Phlox?
PHLOX: I don't care what it tastes like.
T'POL: Wake up, Doctor.
PHLOX: Sub-Commander. Has it been forty eight hours?
T'POL: No.
PHLOX: Then why did you wake me?
T'POL: There's a medical emergency.
PHLOX: Emergency? Then call the doctor.
T'POL: You're the doctor.
PHLOX: Of course. Who's sick?
T'POL: Ensign Mayweather.
PHLOX: Who?
T'POL: Ensign Mayweather, our helmsman.
PHLOX: I know who he is. Where is he?
CUTLER: He's in Sickbay.
PHLOX: We're not in Sickbay?
T'POL: We're in your quarters.
PHLOX: Well then, to Sickbay.
(Phlox gets out of bed and promptly falls on
the floor.)
PHLOX: I could use some assistance, please.
 [Sickbay]
 (Travis is just out of the imaging chamber.)
PHLOX: What seems to be the trouble, Captain?
TRAVIS: It's Travis, Doctor.
CUTLER: He's having some kind of anaphylactic reaction.
PHLOX: Incredible.
T'POL: What?
PHLOX: I've been standing up for almost five minutes.
CUTLER: Doctor.
PHLOX: Hand me that scanner, Captain.
(T'Pol does so, and has to switch
it on for him.)
PHLOX: Ah, yes, yes. It's definitely being caused by an
antigenic compound in his system. We'll need Regulan blood worms.
TRAVIS: What?
PHLOX: They're excellent at filtering toxins.
CUTLER: Er, which container are they in?
PHLOX: No, fresh ones would be better.
(He goes to the comm. panel.)
PHLOX: Set a
course for Regulus, maximum warp.
T'POL: Doctor, I think this was a mistake. You should return to your
quarters.
PHLOX: I appreciate the offer, but it would be best to keep our
relationship professional.
CUTLER: Let's go, Doctor.
PHLOX: I am the Chief Medical Officer on this ship and I am going to
treat Ensign Mayweather. Then I'm going back to bed.
 [Archer's villa]
(Archer is holding a bottle of something.)
 ARCHER: This was
waiting for me when I checked in, compliments of the management. I
don't know anything about Risan vintages, but what do you say we throw
caution to the wind and give it a try?
KEYLA: I'll be adventurous if you will.
ARCHER: How's your ankle?
KEYLA: It's getting better.
ARCHER: You'd think that guide would have warned us.
KEYLA: Oh, the water was very shallow. I should have watched where I
was stepping.
ARCHER: I don't know. That thing was pretty well camouflaged. To Risan
sea turtles.
KEYLA: It's a little sweet for my taste.
ARCHER: Is something wrong?
KEYLA: Camouflaged. We could only see them when they moved.
ARCHER: Was there more than one?
KEYLA: I'm not talking about turtles. You said you knew who they were.
Have you seen them? Did they hurt anyone that you cared about?
ARCHER: We've seen them a number of times, but we've been lucky. No one
was badly hurt.
KEYLA: How do you fight something you can't even see? I was told that
they take their orders from the future.
ARCHER: Is that right?
KEYLA: All their genetic enhancements, they were taught to do that by
someone from the distant future.
ARCHER: Who told you that?
KEYLA: It's no secret. They've attacked dozens of ships, settlements.
But where do they come from? Where do they live?
ARCHER: I wish I could tell you, but I don't know.
KEYLA: What are they planning to do next?
ARCHER: Hopefully, neither of us will ever run into them again.
KEYLA: You know that isn't true. They keep enlisting more of their
people into the, what do they call it? The Cabal. You must know
something about them, Jonathan.
ARCHER: I realise that they murdered your family, and I'm very sorry
for that, but I'm not sure what you want me to tell you.
KEYLA: Most of what I have learned about them has come from rumours and
hearsay, but you have seen them face to face. I want you to tell me
what you know. Where are their Helixes? Where do they live?
ARCHER: If this wine is too sweet, I think there's another bottle here.
It might be different.
KEYLA: You're the first person I've met in over a year who's had any
contact with them.
ARCHER: All right. I don't know much, but I'll tell you what I can. I
could use some fresh air. Why don't we take a walk on the beach?
KEYLA: Thank you.
ARCHER: It's kind of chilly. You might want to go get a sweater or
something.
KEYLA: I'll be right back.
(She leaves.)
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise.
T'POL [OC]: This is T'Pol.
ARCHER: I'm transmitting a bioscan to you. Run it through the computer.
I think you'll find a match.
 [Sickbay]
 T'POL: You don't sound very relaxed, Captain.
ARCHER [OC]: Quickly, please.
T'POL: Understood.
 [Archer's villa]
 KEYLA: Ready?
ARCHER: Not quite.
(Keyla comes in.)
ARCHER: Your surgeons did a nice job. All the
Tandarans I met had a very distinctive feature, right here.
(He points to the
bridge of his nose.)
KEYLA: Tandarans? I don't understand.
ARCHER: I took a bioscan. They may be able to change your face but not
your DNA. Did Colonel Grat send you?
KEYLA: Who?
ARCHER: I suppose it's possible you don't know him. He ran the
detention camp I was sent to. It was filled with innocent Suliban. Grat
asked me the same questions you've been asking, except he was a little
more aggressive. On the other hand, he didn't try to win my sympathy
with fictitious tragedies.
KEYLA: You're wrong, Jonathan. You're all wrong. I think I should
leave.
ARCHER: If it wasn't Grat, then who was it? Who sent you here? Who was
it?
(He takes hold of her arm. She scratches his hand and he starts to pass
out.)
KEYLA: I'm sorry. You've been very kind to me. I'm going to check out
now. I can't have you interfering.
 [Club]
 (The boys are out of the cellar, but still in
their underwear.)
REED: Whatever was in that bottle you broke got all over me. It stinks
to high heaven.
TUCKER: It's not like I had a choice. We needed something to cut
through those ropes.
 [Hoshi's room]
 (She wakes, rolls over and kisses her sleeping
companion.)
RAVIS: Good morning.
HOSHI: Morning.
RAVIS: Sleep well?
HOSHI: Very.
RAVIS: Any thoughts about what you'd like to do today? Risa has a lot
to offer.
HOSHI: I could spend the entire day right here, but I'm afraid the
shuttle's coming to pick me up in a few hours.
RAVIS: Not a very long vacation.
HOSHI: Two days and two nights. That's all we had.
RAVIS: I hope you don't think that I
HOSHI: Took advantage of me? Not for a minute.
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox loads a hypospray.)
 PHLOX: There we go.
T'POL: You're certain?
PHLOX: You can check it yourself if you like, Doctor. The analysis
clearly shows he was given benzethonium chloride. You're quite allergic
to it. This should do the trick.
(He injects Travis.)
T'POL: Your biosigns are stabilising. It seems to be working.
CUTLER: How do you feel?
TRAVIS: A lot better. Thanks, Doc.
(But Phlox is face down on another biobed, snoring.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 (At the villa, Porthos
licks Archer awake. He goes outside but
there's no sign of life at Keyla's villa. On the shuttlepod, returning
to Enterprise, Porthos
is sniffing around Reed.)
HOSHI: What's that smell?
REED: I don't smell anything.
ARCHER: I'm guessing you two had an interesting couple of days.
TUCKER: Fascinating culture, sir. What about you, Hoshi? Do anything
constructive?
HOSHI: As a matter of fact, I learned several new conjugations.
REED: You look rested, sir. Did you get a good night's sleep?
ARCHER: Went out like a light.
TUCKER: Next time we take shore leave, instead of just sitting around
reading books you should try to get out. Look for a little excitement,
meet new people.

  [Captain's
mess]
 (It's coffee break time for the senior staff.)
ARCHER: They don't have a problem with us dropping by?
T'POL: On the contrary. The operations foreman said they haven't had
visitors in nearly six months.
TUCKER: Is it really a matriarchal society? I mean, the women make all
the decisions?
T'POL: Until recently, but in the last decade the Paraagan males have
made great strides to acquire equal rights.
TUCKER: Still, it would probably be best if we didn't get too
flirtatious.
ARCHER: Probably. I read that this colony started off twenty years ago
with just thirty miners. Now there are over three thousand. They've got
schools, landscaped communities, even some kind of museum.
TUCKER: You think twenty years from now there'll be Earth colonies out
this far? Human kids growing up on New Sausalito?
ARCHER: If my father were alive he wouldn't doubt it for a minute.
We're making history with
TUCKER: Every light year. You know, I think I've heard you say that at
least half a dozen times.
(comm. beeps)
ARCHER: Archer here.
TRAVIS [OC]: The Paraagans have given us clearance to enter orbit.
T'POL: Have you received their landing protocols?
TRAVIS [OC]: They're coming in now.
ARCHER: We're on our way.
 [Shuttlepod]
 (The pod is descending towards an M-class looking
planet with wispy cloud cover.)
REED: (piloting) This should take a bit longer than usual.
ARCHER: It wouldn't be very polite to ignite their atmosphere. When are
you supposed to close the plasma ducts?
REED: The protocol said fifty kilometres, but to be on the safe side
I'm going to lock them off at about seventy five.
T'POL: Although the matriarchal elements in the culture have diminished
it might be best if I were to ask
(Sudden explosions around the shuttlepod, and we see the planet's
atmosphere burn away as the pod tumbles helplessly.)
 [Deleted scene - Bridge]
 HOSHI: Enterprise to Shuttlepod one.
Captain Archer, please respond.
TRAVIS: Did you see that?
HOSHI: The shuttlepod's attitude isn't right.
TRAVIS: I'm coming around. Bring the grappler online. (Hoshi goes to
T'Pol's station.) TRAVIS: Hoshi.
HOSHI: Not yet. Now. 
 [Sickbay]
 REED: I closed both plasma ducts. I'm certain of
it.
ARCHER: Are you sure there's nothing left?
HOSHI: We could see the colony in full magnification, sir. The ground
was scorched for at least a hundred kilometres in every direction.
ARCHER: Could one of the dampeners been malfunctioning?
REED: I closed both ducts. Any kind of malfunction would have triggered
an alarm. Two alarms. There are backups to prevent these kinds of
accidents. The ducts were closed.
T'POL: This is no time to be placing blame. A thorough investigation
should explain what happened. How is he?
(Tucker is out cold on a biobed.)
PHLOX: He has a mild concussion, but he should be fine.
ARCHER: Have you tried hailing the colony? There has to be someone down
there.
HOSHI: Sir, I tried to explain. There's nothing left. No buildings, no
trees, no people.
ARCHER: That's impossible. There were thirty six hundred colonists.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Have you finished the diagnostics?
T'POL: I've analysed six of the pod sensor logs. I have two left.
ARCHER: Well, get them done. You've had three hours. (to Tucker) What
about the Enterprise sensor logs? They must have recorded how much
tetrazine was in the atmosphere. Was the concentration greater than the
Paraagans specified? Was it present at higher altitudes than it was
supposed to be?
TUCKER: That's the weird part, sir. The tetrazine levels were less than
three parts per million. That's half what the protocol specified.
ARCHER: What about the point of ignition?
REED: The flash point was directly beneath the shuttle, sir, but it
seems to have originated at the starboard plasma duct.
ARCHER: A plasma duct you're certain was closed.
T'POL: Every log on the shuttle indicates that both ducts were sealed
and locked.
ARCHER: Then you'd better start re-examining those logs, because
something doesn't add up here. Get me Admiral Forrest. This is not
going to be fun.
 [Ready room]
 FORREST [on monitor]: Tetrazine?
ARCHER: It's a by-product of their mining operation. It settles between
forty five and fifty kilometres in their atmosphere. Exhaust plasma is
about the only thing hot enough to ignite it.
FORREST [on monitor]: But you said your plasma ducts were closed.
ARCHER: Yes, sir. We're doing everything we can to determine what went
wrong, but that's not going to change the fact that there are thirty
six hundred corpses down there.
FORREST [on monitor]: Continue to analyse your logs. I'm going to call
an emergency meeting at the Command Council. You realise they'll
undoubtedly bring the Vulcans into this. We'll have to figure out who's
going to contact the Paraagan homeworld.
ARCHER: That should be my responsibility, sir.
FORREST [on monitor]: You're right, it should, but let's take this one
step at a time.
ARCHER: How do you tell all those families that
FORREST [on monitor]: You followed all the protocols that you were
given.
ARCHER: We came here to meet these people, to learn something about
them, not to kill them.
FORREST [on monitor]: You followed the protocols. You've got a crew
that's going to be looking to you to figure out how to react to all
this. Don't let them down. I'll get back to you soon as I can. I'm
sorry, Jon.
 [Sickbay]
 T'POL: His behaviour has been erratic. He seems to
alternate between agitation, despondency and guilt. He spends most of
his time alone. I've tried to remind him that this was an accident, but
his responses have been illogical. He seems to be ignoring his
responsibilities as captain.
PHLOX: Ah, to be Vulcan. It's been my experience that humans have a
great deal of difficulty separating emotional despair from what you
call responsibility.
T'POL: Nevertheless, as his physician you should monitor him closely,
to be certain he remains fit for command.
PHLOX: I understand how uncomfortable his behaviour must be for you,
but trust me, it would be unnatural for the Captain not to be affected
by grief under these circumstances. It's, er, human nature. He'll be
fine.
 [Archer's quarters]
 (Archer is scrolling through the crew manifest,
with Porthos on his lap.)
ARCHER: What is it?
HOSHI [OC]: It's Admiral Forrest, sir.
ARCHER: Thank you.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: The atmospheric analysis of the probe is
coming through.
REED: Put it up here, would you?
TRAVIS: What is it?
REED: The air near the surface is filled with traces of boro-carbons.
TUCKER: When tetrazine is ignited by plasma exhaust, there's only
one outcome you can be sure of.
TRAVIS: Traces of borocarbons.
TUCKER: You got it.
REED: I don't care whether that probe picked up traces of bread
pudding. Both our plasma ducts were locked down, and there were no
leaks in the system. Not unless they miraculously mended themselves
afterwards.
(Archer emerges from the turbolift.)
ARCHER: T'Pol. Trip.
(They follow him out.)
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: The mission's been cancelled.
TUCKER: Cancelled?
ARCHER: From what the Admiral tells me, Ambassador Soval will use this
to convince Starfleet that we need another ten or twenty years before
we try this again.
TUCKER: Twenty years? Starfleet won't buy that for a minute.
ARCHER: Won't they?
TUCKER: Tell him he's crazy! Tell him that's guilt talking, not
Jonathan Archer!
ARCHER: The Vulcan ship will meet us in three days to get you and
Doctor Phlox. Please inform Mister Mayweather to head for these
co-ordinates.
TUCKER: I can't believe you're letting them do this to us. You've
waited all your life to command this ship.
ARCHER: Dismissed.
TUCKER: But, sir.
ARCHER: I said you're dismissed. Both of you.
 [Mess hall]
 TRAVIS: You think they've replaced you in Brazil
yet?
HOSHI: Even if they have, they'd take me back. I'm a prodigy, remember?
How about you?
TRAVIS: After a year on Enterprise, the thought of a cargo ship is
pretty unappealing.
HOSHI: What if they made you Captain? You're going to be the most
famous Boomer around, you know.
TRAVIS: Or maybe infamous. From what Commander Tucker tells me, people
back home think that we're doing nothing out here but getting in
trouble.
HOSHI: Then it's our job to let the people back home know what really
happened. Anyone who tries to bad-mouth Captain Archer in front of me
is going to get an earful in any language they want.
 [Deleted scene - Launch bay]
 T'POL: Lieutenant?
REED: Over here. It's not exactly a smoking gun, but this EM signature
does not belong here.
T'POL: Where did you find it?
REED: On the outer hull, about twelve centimetres below the starboard
plasma duct.
T'POL: It might simply be boro-carbons formed by the explosion.
REED: I already checked. There isn't a carbon atom to be found.
Whatever it is, its profile doesn't match anything in our database.
 [Archer's quarters]
 ARCHER: Come in. What was so important it couldn't
wait till morning?
T'POL: If you'd prefer, I'll come back.
ARCHER: No, I'm sorry. What have you got?
T'POL: Lieutenant Reed and his team have discovered an unidentified EM
signature on the ventral hull of Shuttlepod One.
ARCHER: (looking at PADD) It could be anything.
T'POL: Mister Reed felt you'd be interested.
ARCHER: In what? Does he think that Starfleet Command's going to take a
look at this, apologise, and send us on our way? Tell him it was a nice
try.
T'POL: Is this what humans refer to as feeling sorry for themselves?
ARCHER: You're out of line, Sub-Commander.
T'POL: I apologise. (She moves to leave.)
ARCHER: I wish I was simply feeling sorry for myself, but actually, I'm
feeling sorry for a whole lot of people. Every member of Starfleet, in
fact. Their futures depended upon my ability to succeed at this
mission.
T'POL: As soon as we learned about the consequences of the explosion, I
knew the Vulcan High Command would take advantage of the situation.
ARCHER: What's your point?
T'POL: You have a responsibility to dispute their recommendation.
ARCHER: Starfleet already bought their recommendation. Hook, line and
sinker.
T'POL: Then you have a responsibility to convince them as well.
ARCHER: And how do you suggest I do that?
T'POL: You are very adept at listing the questionable decisions you've
made, but there have been other decisions, many of them, that no one
would question. I'm willing to try to convince my government of that.
Are you willing to try to convince yours?
ARCHER: You know, this has got to be the first time a Vulcan has ever
attempted to cheer up a human.
T'POL: I'll see you in the morning.
 [Sickbay]
 (Bird-like squawks from a container when Tucker goes
near it.)
PHLOX: That's all right, Commander. Your company is appreciated, but it
would be best if you left the packing to me.
TUCKER: I would have thought you'd be a little more upset about leaving
Enterprise.
PHLOX: Well, I did expect this posting would last a while longer, but
I'm sure an equally adventurous opportunity will present itself.
TUCKER: I wish I had your attitude.
PHLOX: Humans seem to be naturally optimistic. I'm surprised you don't
share my outlook that something exciting always waiting around the next
nebula.
TUCKER: That's just the point. There won't be any nebulas in
Starfleet's future. At least not for a decade or so.
PHLOX: Oh, I wouldn't be so sure of that.
TUCKER: You're wrong, Doc. You worked with Vulcans. You know what they
think of us. Enterprise coming back to Earth with it's tail tucked
between its legs. It'll be Soval's crowning achievement. They'll
probably give the son of a bitch some gaudy medal and then cart him off
to wherever they send bitter old Vulcans to retire.
PHLOX: Ambassador Soval's service record contains an impressive list of
accomplishments.
TUCKER: You have to find something good in everybody, don't you. I got
to tell you, that's one of your unique qualities that drives me crazy.
PHLOX: I'll certainly miss your outspoken personality, Mister Tucker.
TUCKER: I'll see you later, Doc.
 [Archer's quarters]
 ARCHER: Come on, Porthos. Time for bed. (He turns out
light.) ARCHER: Porthos, up. What's the matter, boy? Don't tell me you're
(He turns the light back on, and he's in a different bed, wearing different
pants. The view out of the window is of a city.)
ARCHER: Porthos? What's going on here? (comm. beep) Hello?
TUCKER [OC]: Sorry to call so late, Captain, but all three inspection
pods are getting their weekly overhauls tonight. They tell me they
won't be ready till noon, so I figured you might want to sleep in.
ARCHER: Might want to sleep in. What do you say to breakfast at nine
thirty, Spacedock cafeteria?
TUCKER [OC]: You must be reading my mind. I was just about to suggest
the same thing.
ARCHER: See you in the morning. (to Porthos) If you're trying to tell
me the last ten months was a dream, I'm not buying it. (He activates a
monitor.)
RECEPTIONIST [on monitor]: IME,. Can I help you?
ARCHER: This is Captain Jonathan Archer, Starfleet authorisation alpha
six four
RECEPTIONIST [on monitor]: I know who you are, Captain. What can I do
for you?
ARCHER: Do you have a Denobulan doctor in the Interspecies Medical
Exchange?
RECEPTIONIST [on monitor]: Yes, a Doctor Phlox. He's assigned to
Starfleet Medical here in San Francisco. Would you like me to contact
him for you?
ARCHER: No, that's all right. Thanks for your help. (Ends
communication.) ARCHER: I didn't even know Phlox existed before they brought
Klaang in. And that was the day after the late night call from Trip.
DANIELS: You're not dreaming, Captain.
ARCHER: Daniels.
DANIELS: This must be very disorienting. I apologise, but I had no
choice.
ARCHER: Commander Tucker told me you were dead, that Silik killed you.
DANIELS: He did, in a manner of speaking. We have to talk, Captain, and
it's essential that none of the other factions know about it. I doubt
any of them would think I'd bring you here.
ARCHER: So, you're telling me you brought me back, what, ten months
ago? How about Jonathan Archer ten months ago? Where's he?
DANIELS: He's you.
ARCHER: Then who just climbed into bed aboard Enterprise?
DANIELS: That hasn't happened yet.
ARCHER: That's a load of crap and you know it.
DANIELS: I've had this same conversation with half a dozen people. It
always ends up the same way.
ARCHER: Can't you ever give a straight answer?
DANIELS: It depends on the question.
ARCHER: All right, try this one. Why am I here? I thought you were
supposed to protect the timeline, not screw with it.
DANIELS: It's already been screwed with, Captain. That explosion at the
Paraagan colony, it wasn't supposed to happen.
ARCHER: Of course, it wasn't. It was an accident.
DANIELS: That's not what I mean. History never recorded the disaster.
Someone violated the Temporal Accord. Someone who doesn't want your
mission to succeed.
ARCHER: Are you telling me that Enterprise didn't cause that explosion?
DANIELS: Do you remember the Temporal Cold War I spoke of?
ARCHER: It's kind of hard to forget.
DANIELS: Then listen to me carefully. We don't have much time.
(Back on board Enterprise)
ARCHER: All senior staff report to the situation room in fifteen
minutes. Mister Reed, I'd like you in my quarters immediately.
 [Situation room]
(Reed comes in holding a eight-sided object about
two inches wide.)  REED: It was just where we detected the EM signature. But I
don't understand. It was completely invisible. How on Earth did you
know that a phase-discriminator would expose it?
ARCHER: (handing it to T'Pol) If I'm not mistaken, you'll find this
thing was designed to generate a plasma stream. Put a team together,
Trip. I'll need two quantum beacons. They'll have to be positron-based
and have an output of two hundred gigawatts apiece.
TUCKER: Positron-based, sir?
ARCHER: Just get started. I'll bring you the specs in a few minutes.
We're going to need our comm. frequencies on the fritz for a day or so.
See to it.
HOSHI: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: Put the Armoury on full alert. Turn the ship around, Travis.
We're going back to the Paraagan colony. What are you all waiting for?
TUCKER: Sir?
ARCHER: It wasn't us, Trip. We didn't do it.
 [Engineering - Tucker's office]
(Archer is manipulating image on a monitor.)  ARCHER: Take a
look at the dispersal curve here and here. You'll have to isolate the
sub-assembly tolerances from the emitter algorithms.
TUCKER: Whoa, hold on a minute. You're saying the assembly's
independent of the emitters?
ARCHER: Exactly.
TUCKER: That's impossible.
ARCHER: Not if you generate a stable flux between the positron
conductors. Then all you'll have to do is renormalise the tertiary wave
functions.
TUCKER: With all due respect, sir this is a level of quantum
engineering that's beyond anything I ever learned. How the hell do you
know this?
ARCHER: Remember Crewman Daniels?
TUCKER: Yeah. I saw him get vaporised by our friend, Silik.
ARCHER: Well, for a cloud of vapour, he's one wealth of information. I
just spent two hours with him.
TUCKER: He's on Enterprise?
ARCHER: Not exactly. Listen, I'll explain later. Right now we've got to
get back to building these beacons.
TUCKER: Whatever you say.
 [Bridge]
 (T'Pol is holding the Suliban device.)
ARCHER: The circuitry in there isn't compatible with our technology.
We'll have to create an interface.
HOSHI: What for?
ARCHER: We're going to be retrieving some Suliban data discs. I have no
doubt you'll be able to handle the content, but before you can do that
we'll have to find a way to access the data.
T'POL: And Daniels claims this is Suliban technology?
ARCHER: Everything he's told me has checked out so far. I have no
reason to doubt him this.
HOSHI: We'll do our best, Captain.
T'POL: Captain. The Vulcan ship we were headed for, it's no doubt
detected we've altered course.
ARCHER: Have they tried to hail us?
HOSHI: I wouldn't know, sir. Our comm. is on the fritz.
 [Corridor]
 REED: Why did Daniels leave it in his quarters?
ARCHER: I don't recall him having much time to pack before he left.
REED: No. Well, if it is there and it contains what he said it does, it
could be invaluable to Starfleet.
ARCHER: I gave Daniels my word, Malcolm. We download the schematics for
the Suliban Stealth Cruiser, nothing else.
REED: Pity. Assuming he's right and we manage to find the Cruiser what
makes you think the Suliban won't come after us? (Reed enters the code for the security lock on Daniel's
quarters.)
ARCHER: Just like those old Bible movies, Malcolm. It wasn't written.
 [Daniel's quarters]
 (Archer takes a case out of a cupboard and opens
it on the desk. He removes a fat paddle-shaped device.)
ARCHER: So far, Daniels is batting a thousand.
(He puts it down and switches it on. It is a holographic database
projector. He scrolls through the contents.)
REED: Wait a minute. Did you see that? They've got schematics on half a
dozen different Klingon ships.
ARCHER: The Stealth Cruiser, Lieutenant. Nothing else.
REED: There. There it is.
(They isolate the data and copy it onto a scanner.)
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER: Trip?
TUCKER: I feel like a chef who's just made a meal with ingredients he's
never tasted.
ARCHER: You follow the instructions?
TUCKER: To the letter.
T'POL [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: We're approaching the colony.
ARCHER: Have Mister Mayweather locate a binary system two point five
light years away and set a course.
T'POL [OC]: Understood.
ARCHER: Let's get these mounted on the grappler arms.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Head for the smaller star, then the inner
moon of the second planet.
 [Armoury]
 ARCHER [OC]: Bridge to Armoury.
REED: Reed here.
ARCHER [OC]: Have you plotted all the target points?
REED: Aye, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: Stand by.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: (to Tucker) I'll meet you two in the launch
bay. (to T'Pol) If this goes well, I shouldn't be long. (to Travis)
Lower the beacons. (to Hoshi) Modify the viewscreen. Bring up these
coordinates. Full magnification. (They show a craggy landscape.)
ARCHER: Activate the beacons. (A ship appears, docked to a station.) ARCHER: Right where
they're supposed to be.
HOSHI: Aren't we in range of their sensors, sir?
ARCHER: They can see us, but they have no idea we can see through their
cloak. Just keep on the same course, Travis. Malcolm?
 [Armoury]
 REED: The closer, the better, sir.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: They're charging weapons.
ARCHER: Now, Mister Reed. (Multiple phase cannon shots hit the cruiser.)
 [Armoury]
 CREWMAN: Their cloaking generator's down.
REED: All four weapon banks, as well.
CREWMAN: Port and starboard engines disabled.
REED: Okay, here's the tricky part.
(A photon torpedo is launched and strikes the underneath of the
cruiser.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 REED [OC]: Reed to Shuttlepod two.
ARCHER: Archer here.
REED [OC]: She's all yours, Captain. Good luck.  (Archer hands phase pistols to T'Pol and Tucker.)
ARCHER: That last shot
should have sealed off the two lower decks. If Daniels is right, there
shouldn't be more than twenty Suliban for us to deal with.
TUCKER: (piloting) Is that all?
(The shuttlepod launches and flies to dock with the cruiser)
 [Suliban cruiser]
 (Archer uses his scanner to open the doors.)
TUCKER: The stun grenade's on a three-second delay.
(He throws it out and five Suliban fall from the corridor ceiling. They
head out down the corridors.)
 [Armoury]
(Reed is watching their progress on a monitor.)  REED: Just
ten more metres.
 [Suliban cruiser]
 (It's a running firefight as the trio head along
the corridors.)
ARCHER: Go.
(They enter a control room, and Trip throws out another stun grenade to
stop anyone following them in.)
T'POL: Which one? (Archer sits in front of a set of panels.)
ARCHER: Here. (He opens it up and
removes three discs.) ARCHER: Go.
(Back out in the corridors, Suliban are moving along the floors and
ceilings towards them.)
T'POL: Captain, they're all around us.
ARCHER: Archer to Reed.
REED [OC]: Go ahead.
ARCHER: We need some help here.
 [Armoury]
 REED: I see them. You'd better take cover. (He fires
a phase cannon at the cruiser's docking clamp and the explosion knocks
out the Suliban.) [Suliban cruiser]ARCHER: Go.
(They make it back inside the shuttlepod just as the Suliban get into
the airlock room and open the hatch.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER: What's the problem?
TUCKER: I can't release the docking clamps.
(The Suliban try to force their way in.)
ARCHER: Ignite the thrusters. Go to full power.
(They finally rip free, leaving Suliban floating in vacuum.)
ARCHER: Archer to Mayweather.
TRAVIS [OC]: We see you, Captain.
ARCHER: Set a course back ward the Vulcan ship. Go to warp four as soon
as we're aboard.
TRAVIS [OC]: Yes, sir.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: It took a while before we realized that the
three discs had to work in unison. The interface seems to be holding.
ARCHER: Hoshi?
HOSHI: The Stealth Cruiser was definitely in orbit of the Paraagan
colony when the explosion took place. They were monitoring us very
closely. There are sensors logs that tracked our course, our altitude,
even our hull temperature. Look at these. (Lovely shots of Enterprise
viewed from underneath with the planet behind.)
ARCHER: I can't believe how close they got.
T'POL: They got a lot closer than you think. (She calls up images of the
shuttlepod on it's way to the surface.)
HOSHI: Those cloaking devices sure come in handy.
T'POL: They were docked with the shuttlepod for nearly two minutes.
ARCHER: Just long enough to attach this and cloak it. Good work. Keep
at it. Get me Admiral Forrest.
 [Ready room]
 FORREST [on monitor]: Sounds like pretty solid
evidence. Where the hell did you get it?
ARCHER: It's all on three data discs we took from a cloaked Suliban
Cruiser.
FORREST [on monitor]: But how did you know about that cruiser? And if
it was cloaked, how could you find it?
ARCHER: I've got friends in high places.
FORREST [on monitor]: This is going to be a very interesting
debriefing. Get to the Vulcan ship as quickly as you can. I'll let them
know what you've got. I can't tell you how pleased I am, Jonathan.
After all you've done, I would have hated to see this end.
ARCHER: Thank you for believing in us, Admiral. Archer out.
 [Temporal chamber - Suliban Helix]
 SILIK: They boarded a cloaked vessel and they knew
exactly where to find the discs.
FUTURE MAN: They weren't acting alone.
SILIK: My ships are fast. We can overtake them and destroy Enterprise.
FUTURE MAN: Have your ships bring me Archer. Allow Enterprise to
continue.
SILIK: But we need to recover the discs.
FUTURE MAN: Archer. You know what happened the last time you failed me.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: It was ten months ago. He brought me back
ten months, but I knew everything I know now. How is that possible?
T'POL: As I've told you, the Vulcan Science Directorate has concluded
that time travel is impossible.
ARCHER: Well, good for the Vulcan Science Directorate. Maybe they can
tell me how I woke up yesterday knowing exactly where that Suliban ship
was, or how I suddenly had the ability to construct a quantum beacon to
see through its cloak. And while they're at it, they might as well tell
me how I knew where to find those discs.
T'POL: All valid questions, but to conclude that the only answer is
that you acquired this information from a dead crewman who transported
you back through time is illogical.
ARCHER: Why don't you give me another explanation?
T'POL: I can't.
ARCHER: Because there isn't one. I got a call from Trip, something
about inspection pods. It was the exact same call I got the day before
they found Klaang. Word for word.
T'POL: Perhaps you were dreaming.
ARCHER: Listen. I never thought this was possible, either, but I
travelled through time and I need you to believe me.
T'POL: Why?
ARCHER: Because it's hard enough trying to fathom all this without
having my Science Officer, a colleague who I trust and rely on, the
person who got me to stop feeling sorry for myself, accusing me of
being an hallucinating madman.
T'POL: I don't remember accusing you of anything.
REED [OC]: Bridge to Archer.
ARCHER: Yes?
REED [OC]: We're getting some strange readings, sir. It might not be a
bad idea for you to come out here.
 [Bridge]
 REED: I've taken the liberty of asking Commander
Tucker to join us.
ARCHER: What's the problem?
REED: We're having trouble balancing the warp field.
ARCHER: Looks okay to me.
REED: It's odd. It'll be stable one moment, and then, for no reason,
it'll go slightly out of alignment.
TUCKER: What are you guys doing to my engines?
T'POL: The auto-stabilisers aren't functioning properly.
TUCKER: The computer ran its last diagnostic on them less than ten
minutes ago. They look fine.
REED: Well, they're not. We've had to realign the field a dozen times
over the last hour.
ARCHER: Load torpedoes, and stand by all weapons. Deploy the beacons,
Travis. Modify the Viewscreen and aim the beacons aft.
(The viewscreen shows six green blobs in formation just beyond the
nacelles.)
ARCHER: Swing them down slowly. (Another six blobs come into view.)
TUCKER: It looks like we're in a swarm of cloaked bees.
ARCHER: Charge the phase cannons.
HOSHI: We're being hailed.
ARCHER: Put it through.
SILIK [on viewscreen]: I wouldn't advise using your weapons, Jonathan.
Perhaps if we decloak, you'll understand why.
(There are dozens of the pods. Hoshi suspends the transmission.)
ARCHER: Malcolm?
REED: They're all armed with high-yield particle weapons, sir.
ARCHER: How many could you take out?
REED: Before they open fire? Not enough, sir. (Transmission resumed.)
SILIK [on viewscreen]: One of my ships is approaching your starboard
docking port. I'd like you to board it immediately.
ARCHER: What do you want with me?
SILIK [on viewscreen]: You have five minutes. If you don't comply I
have permission to destroy Enterprise.
ARCHER: How do I know you won't destroy Enterprise either way?
SILIK [on viewscreen]: You have my word, Captain. And you also have
four and a half minutes left. (ends transmission)
ARCHER: (to T'Pol) I'm placing you in command. I advise you to maintain
your present course and speed. I don't know what's going to happen, but
try to keep an open mind. Especially when it comes to things the Vulcan
Science Directorate says are impossible.
T'POL: I'll try.
TUCKER: Captain, this is crazy. How do you know what they're going to
do?
ARCHER: T'Pol's in command now, Trip. Do whatever you n to help her.
That goes for all of you. (to Hoshi) Keep an eye on Porthos for me,
would you? Remember, no cheese.
(Archer steps into turbolift, and walks out into - a devastated building.)
SILIK [on viewscreen]: Your captain's playing a very dangerous game,
Sub-Commander.
T'POL: Game?
SILIK [on viewscreen]: He has thirty seconds left. Did he think I
wasn't serious? (Hoshi pauses transmission.)
TUCKER: The turbolift's on E deck. It's empty.
T'POL: Where is he?
TUCKER: I'm not reading his biosigns. He must be on the Suliban ship.
T'POL: (resuming transmission) Captain Archer is no longer aboard
Enterprise. Perhaps you should check with the vessel you sent for him.
SILIK [on viewscreen]: I thought he was smarter than this. He could
have saved all your lives. What a waste. (Ends transmission.)
TRAVIS: The docked ship is moving away.
REED: It's targeting our warp core. They're all targeting the warp
core.
 [Devastated building]
 (Archer steps through the tangled mass of girders
until he comes to a broken window, and looks out on a cityscape of
wrecked skyscrapers and a sullen grey cloudy sky.)
DANIELS: Ten minutes ago, that vista was more beautiful than anything
you could imagine.
ARCHER: Where am I?
DANIELS: I had breakfast in that room less than half an hour ago. Then
I was instructed to bring you here. They told me that the timeline
wouldn't be safe if you boarded that Suliban ship. Someone was very
mistaken.
ARCHER: Where is here?
DANIELS: You're in the thirty first century, Captain, or what's left of
it.
ARCHER: You said the Suliban wouldn't follow us, that we'd make it
safely to the Vulcan ship.
DANIELS: As far as I was told that was exactly what was supposed to
occur.
ARCHER: So you're telling me this just happened? It doesn't look like
it just happened.
DANIELS: No. It looks like it happened a long time ago.
ARCHER: If bringing me here caused this, then send me back. I'll take
my chances with Silik.
DANIELS: You don't understand. All our equipment, the time portals,
have been destroyed. Everything's been destroyed. There's no way to
send you back.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Shockwave part 2
Shockwave
part 2
 Original Airdate: 18 Sep, 2002
  ARCHER
[OC]: Last time on Enterprise.
(The explosion in the atmosphere of the Paraagan mining colony.)
HOSHI: (in Sickbay) There's nothing left. No buildings, no trees, no
people.
ARCHER: That's impossible. There were thirty six hundred colonists.
ARCHER: (Ready room) The mission's been cancelled.
TUCKER: I can't believe you're letting them do this to us. You've
waited all your life to command this ship.
DANIELS: (Archers apartment) History never recorded the disaster.
Someone violated the Temporal Accord. Someone who doesn't want your
mission to succeed.
ARCHER: Are you telling me that Enterprise didn't cause that explosion?
ARCHER: (Ready room) He brought me back ten months, but I knew
everything I know now. How is that possible?
ARCHER [OC]: The Suliban destroyed that colony. (attack on cloaked
cruiser) We're going back to get proof.
FUTURE MAN: (Temporal chamber) Have your ships bring me Archer.
T'POL: (Bridge} Captain Archer is no longer aboard Enterprise.
SILIK [on viewscreen]: I thought he was smarter than this. He could
have saved all your lives.
REED: It's targeting our warp core.
DANIELS: (Devastated building) You're in the thirty first century,
Captain.
ARCHER: If bringing me here caused this, then send me back. I'll take
my chances with Silik.
DANIELS: You don't understand. The time portals have been destroyed.
Everything's been destroyed. There's no way to send you back.
ARCHER [OC]: And now, the conclusion.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: He's not on board. You must have sensors
that can confirm that.
SILIK [on viewscreen]: You've lied to me before. If you don't tell me
where he is I'll have no alternative but to
T'POL: Come see for yourself, or send your soldiers. You'll realise I'm
telling the truth.
SILIK [on viewscreen]: Drop out of warp and prepare to be boarded.
(Ends transmission.)
REED: Security teams to docking ports one, two, and three.
T'POL: This is Sub-Commander T'Pol. All security teams remain where you
are.
TUCKER: Are you crazy? How do we know how many Suliban are coming
aboard? They could try to take over the ship.
T'POL: There are thirty armed vessels surrounding us. Unless I'm
mistaken their weapons are still targeting our warp core. Mister Reed?
So, unless you have a better suggestion?
(The Suliban pods dock with Enterprise.)
 [Wrecked plaza]
 ARCHER: If this place was destroyed as long ago as
it seems to have been, then what are you doing here? You and your
watchdog buddies don't exactly fit in with all this.
DANIELS: You're thinking of time travel like we're in some H.G. Wells
novel. We're not. It's far more complicated. There's no way for you to
understand.
ARCHER: Try me. Listen, I realise your little utopia is gone, and I
sympathise, but if you're telling me the truth, if you've brought me
eight hundred years into the future, into this future, I think I
deserve some answers.
DANIELS: I don't have any answers. And you're right, I shouldn't be
here. Which means you shouldn't be here either, but you are. We are. We
brought you here to protect the time line. We did quite a job.
ARCHER: What's wrong?
DANIELS: It's gone.
ARCHER: What's gone?
DANIELS: The monument. It was right here on the same street as the
library. It was obviously never built.
ARCHER: Why is that a problem? Who did it commemorate?
DANIELS: Not who.
ARCHER: Then what?
DANIELS: An organisation. The Federation. It doesn't exist for you, not
yet.
ARCHER: But it will? Fine. Keep your missing monument to yourself.
Where's this library you were talking about?
DANIELS: It should be right down there, if it was ever built, and even
it was, it will be of no help. All the data's stored electronically.
(They head to an impressive neo-classical building with a low central
dome, triangular portico, tall windows, which looks very intac.t)
 [Library]
 (Massive bookshelves, librarians ladders, light
streaming through the broken dome skylight.)
DANIELS: Books made with paper. There aren't supposed to be books here.
ARCHER: Well, there are. So, I suggest we use some of them to figure
out what you did to the last thousand years when you brought me here
this morning.
 [Bridge]
 (The Suliban are going through the ship in groups
of three, scanning for something room by room. A Suliban refers to the data discs.)
SULIBAN: They haven't been duplicated. (Silik threatens Hoshi with a weapon.)
SILIK: Is he correct?
T'POL: Don't you believe your scanners?
SILIK: Is he correct?
HOSHI: We didn't have time to make a copy.
TUCKER: Leave her alone!
SILIK: Lower your weapon. (does likewise) If we find Captain Archer
aboard this vessel, you'll all be punished for lying to me.
RAAN: He's not here, unless he's dead, but we did find this. (He shows
Silik a scanner reading.)
SILIK: Where?
RAAN: In that lift. It's an hour old, maybe two.
SILIK: When I saw him last, your Captain spoke of a Temporal Cold War.
What was he talking about?
T'POL: Captain Archer believed Crewman Daniels was from the future, but
if I recall, you killed him.
SILIK: What else?
T'POL: Nothing else.
SILIK: There's a temporal signature in your turbolift. What do you know
of that?
T'POL: The last time we saw Captain Archer, he was entering that
turbolift.
SILIK: Perhaps you haven't been lying to me. (to Tucker) You, shut down
all comm. systems and computer terminals with the exception of
Engineering and the Bridge. Confine all of them to their quarters. If
anyone resists
RAAN: Understood.
(one grabs Trip, he shoves back and weapons are drawn again)
T'POL: Under the circumstances, it would be best to do what he says,
Commander.
 [Starfleet Headquarters, San Francisco]
 (It's a beautiful sunny morning.)
SOVAL: They're three days overdue.
FORREST: I told you, Ambassador. Archer said he was returning with
proof that they weren't responsible for the tragedy on Paraagan Two.
SOVAL: You also told me Starfleet had ordered him to deliver
Sub-Commander T'Pol and his medical officer to the Vulcan ship D'kyr.
They're three days overdue.
WILLIAMS: The D'kyr has long range sensors. Have they detected
Enterprise?
SOVAL: Captain Archer's negligence caused the death of three thousand
colonists. Your superiors instructed them to return to Earth. Their
mission is over. They haven't followed those instructions.
FORREST: You didn't answer the Commander's question. Has your ship
detected Enterprise?
SOVAL: The D'kyr said they were joined by a number of other vessels.
They're no longer within sensor range.
WILLIAMS: What kind of vessels?
SOVAL: They were at too great a distance to identify. Enterprise has
ignored our hails and defied Starfleet's orders. I have no choice but
to send the D'kyr in pursuit.
FORREST: Jonathan Archer doesn't report to you.
SOVAL: No, he doesn't, but Sub-Commander T'Pol does, and since she
would never comply with his present actions I have to conclude that
she's being held against her will.
WILLIAMS: I know you don't think much of Archer, Ambassador, but he is
not in the habit of kidnapping Vulcans.
FORREST: Fine. You send your ship. Whatever Archer's up to, I'm sure
he's got a good reason. He knows what he's doing.
SOVAL: Does he really? (The Vulcan group leave.)
 [Helix]
 RAAN: Have you cycled through the sub-temporal
harmonics?
SILIK: He's never failed to respond before.
RAAN: Perhaps he's angry that we didn't return with Archer.
SILIK: Archer wasn't on Enterprise. Why isn't he responding? I need
instructions.
RAAN: He said to destroy Enterprise if we couldn't bring him Archer. We
should tow them out of the nebula and do it now.
SILIK: That temporal signature, it changes everything. If Archer was
pulled through time, we need new instructions. Where is he?
RAAN: If he's angry with you, you'll be punished again. We should
destroy Enterprise.
SILIK: Have the surgeons prepare, then bring me the Vulcan.
 [Library]
 ARCHER: I haven't found a single reference to this
Federation you talked about.
DANIELS: I doubt you will.
ARCHER: Because that monument wasn't there?
DANIELS: Because you weren't there.
ARCHER: So I disappear one day and all history changes?
DANIELS: I've looked through the twenty first and twenty second
centuries. Everything looks right up until the Warp Five programme.
After that, nothing looks right.
ARCHER: There were a lot of people involved in the Warp Five programme.
DANIELS: We didn't bring a lot of people here this morning. We just
brought you.
ARCHER: (reading a book title) The Romulan Star Empire. What's that?
DANIELS: Maybe you shouldn't be reading that.
ARCHER: I don't get it. What could I have done that could have been so
important?
DANIELS: It wasn't just you, it was events you helped set in motion.
ARCHER: This timeline, the one you say no longer exists. What can you
tell me about it if my mission had continued?
DANIELS: It would have led to others.
ARCHER: And? (silence) Okay, what about this Federation? Was Earth part
of it? Was I part of it?
DANIELS: Silik wanted you, not the data disks. The people he answered
to were more interested in capturing Jonathan Archer than in blaming
Enterprise for the destruction of the colony. They obviously knew what
role you were going to play in the months or years to come. By taking
you away from the twenty second century I caused exactly what I was
trying to prevent.
ARCHER: You've lost me.
DANIELS: The only chance I have of restoring my century is by getting
you back to yours.
ARCHER: Sounds like you've got a chicken-or-the-egg problem. You said
your time portals are gone. All your technology. There isn't even
electricity here. You going to find a bicycle, turn it into a time
machine?
DANIELS: Maybe we don't need a time machine. Do you have your
communicator?
ARCHER: (hands it over) And my scanner.
DANIELS: May I? The people the Suliban were working for came from about
three hundred years ago. They couldn't travel through time, but they
did develop a way to send back images of themselves, to communicate
through time.
ARCHER: You can't do that with those.
DANIELS: No, it's a little bit more complicated, but not much. We
learned how to do it in high school, but we're going to need a few
things that might not be too easy to find.
ARCHER: What are we waiting for?
 [Helix - interrogation room]
 (Enterprise is docked with the Helix. T'Pol is
down to her underwear, in a metal chair with a heavy device around her
neck. She is being given drugs.)
SILIK: Where is Archer?
T'POL: I don't know.
SILIK: Who are you working with from the future?
T'POL: The Vulcan Science Directorate has determined that time travel
is impossible.
SILIK: Does Captain Archer agree with that opinion?
T'POL: It's not an opinion.
SILIK: Does Archer agree with that determination?
T'POL: Captain Archer believes Crewman Daniels comes from the future.
SILIK: But Daniels is dead.
T'POL: Captain Archer claims he saw Daniels two days ago.
SILIK: Your captain is gone. Did Daniels take him into the past or the
future?
T'POL: The Vulcan Science Directorate has determined that time travel
is impossible.
 [Wrecked city - outdoors]
 ARCHER: I can't be sure, but I think that's
copper.
DANIELS: Well done. I need you to unwrap it and pound it into small
strips no more than a millimetre thick.
 [Reed's quarters]
 (Malcolm is pacing up and down when weird sounds
come out of the door comm.) REED: Hello? Please repeat. I can't
understand. I still can't understand you. Try modulating the
sub-carrier wave.
TUCKER [OC]: Malcolm, can you hear me?
REED: Barely. You're going to need to boost the signal.
TUCKER [OC]: Any better?
REED: Yeah.
 [Tucker's quarters]
 REED [OC]: I thought the comm. was offline.
TUCKER: It is. I'm routing the signal through the EPS grid. I can talk
to any doorbell on B deck.
 [Reed's quarters]
 REED: Are you all right?
 [Tucker's quarters]
 TUCKER: Same as you, I guess. Locked in tight.
 [Reed's quarters]
 REED: And the others?
TUCKER [OC]: I can't get in contact with T'Pol for some reason,
 [Tucker's quarters]
 TUCKER: And Hoshi and Travis are on C deck.
REED [OC]: Any thoughts about how we're going to get rid of these
Suliban?
TUCKER: One step at a time. The first thing I need to do is figure out
how to tap into the door comms
 [Reed's quarters]
 TUCKER [OC]: On C-deck. I'll get back to you. Sit
tight.
REED: I wasn't planning on going anywhere.
 [Wrecked city - outdoors]
 (Daniels is doing the tech stuff while Archer hits
metal with a piece of concrete.)
ARCHER: Any luck?
DANIELS: I still have the spatial coordinates of Enterprise, but
without a quantum discriminator it's going to be very tricky to contact
the ship on the same day you left.
ARCHER: I thought you built these things in high school.
DANIELS: Where quantum discriminators were on every desk.
ARCHER: Why is the same day so important? What would be wrong with
making contact a week before I left or even a month before?
DANIELS: I made the biggest mistake in the history of time travel this
morning. I don't intend to make it any worse.
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 (Two Suliban dump her back on her bed then leave.
Trembling she bathes her face, then lies down again, cuddling a
cushion.)
ARCHER [OC]: This is Captain Archer. Can you hear me? T'Pol, this is
Captain Archer. Can you hear me? (His head is visible in the room). ARCHER: I
don't think it's working.
T'POL: I don't know
where he is. (T'Pol is still dopey from the drugs and interrogation.)
ARCHER [OC]: You don't know where who is? Sub-Commander, this is
Captain Archer. I'm having trouble understanding you.
T'POL: Captain Archer's gone. A temporal reading in the turbolift. I
don't know where he is.
ARCHER [OC]: Daniels brought me to the future. That's what the temporal
reading was all about. Are you all right?
T'POL: Science Vulcan Directorate has determined that time travel is
not fair.
ARCHER [OC]: Whatever you say. Just tell me, are you all right?
T'POL: We're all confined to our quarters.
ARCHER [OC]: Where are you?
T'POL: I told you, in my quarters.
ARCHER [OC]: No, I mean Enterprise. Where's Enterprise?
T'POL: There's a Helix out my window.
ARCHER [OC]: T'Pol, listen to me. I need your help. You're going to
have to find a way to get to Daniels' quarters. Do you understand me?
T'POL: You're on the ceiling. Why aren't you on a monitor?
ARCHER [OC]: There's no technology where I am.
T'POL: I thought you said you were in the future.
ARCHER [OC]: T'Pol, do you remember when I asked you to keep an open
mind?
T'POL: Yes.
ARCHER [OC]: There's a lot more at stake here than bringing me back, or
the mission. I need you to listen to me very carefully. I need you to
trust me.
 [Tucker's quarters]
 TUCKER: It won't work. We can only access the
decoupling pins from outside our quarters.
 [Travis's quarters]
 TRAVIS: So if we can't pick the locks, what about
the shafts that house the EPS conduits?
 [Reed's quarters]
 TRAVIS [OC]: They're adjacent to the air ducts.
REED: They were pretty much blocked off when the ship was completed.
 [Tucker's quarters]
 REED [OC]: It would be too tight a squeeze.
TUCKER: What's your definition of too tight?
 [Reed's quarters]
 REED: Well, you or I couldn't get through them.
 [Tucker's quarters]
 REED [OC]: Maybe a child, or
TUCKER: Or Hoshi?
REED [OC]: It's possible, but it would be difficult.
TUCKER: What do you say, Hoshi?
 [Hoshi's quarters]
 TUCKER [OC]: You willing to give it a try?
HOSHI: Isn't there some other way that I can help out? Something that
needs translating? You know how claustrophobic I am.
 [Travis's quarters]
 TRAVIS: There's no one else that can get through
those crawlspaces, unless we could reach Crewman Naiman.
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 TRAVIS [OC]: She's pretty small.
T'POL: There's no time. If this is going to work, we need to begin now.
Ensign Sato.
HOSHI [OC]: How far would I have to go to get to the Doctor's quarters?
T'POL: Forty metres, maybe forty five.
 [Hoshi's quarters]
 HOSHI: Then how far to Lieutenant Reed's?
TUCKER [OC]: It's not that far, Hoshi.
 [Tucker's quarters]
 TUCKER: You can do it. We need you to do it.
 [Crawlspace]
 (Hoshi is having to slither and wiggle in the
small space between pipes and stuff. At one point she looks down
through a grill to see two Suliban patrolling a corridor. She gets to
Phlox's quarters and knocks on the grill. He has been preparing some
hyposprays.)
PHLOX: Hoshi?
HOSHI: Good guess.
PHLOX: How are you holding up? (Hoshi reaches down through the grill.)
HOSHI: Great. If you don't mind
I'd just like to get this over with. (Phlox gives her the hyposprays.)
PHLOX:  Good luck.
(She continues on, then punches out a grill into a corridor and starts
to lower herself down. Her vest gets caught on a hook and she drops to
the floor, leaving it behind.)
 [Reed's quarters}
 (The door opens to reveal - Hoshi with her arms
crossed in front of her naked breasts.)
HOSHI: Whatever you're about to say I don't want to hear it. Just get
me a shirt.
 [Transporter alcove]
 (Two Suliban come across T'Pol dressed and sitting
on the floor, muttering to herself.)
T'POL: Third dimension, timeline. Timeline, first, second,
SULIBAN: What are you doing?
T'POL: First, third dimension.
SULIBAN: Stand up, Vulcan. Up! (He kicks her then hauls her to her feet.)
T'POL: No! No! No! (Tucker and Reed drop down from the ceiling.) T'POL: No!
Stop! (They hypo the Suliban and drag them away.)
 [Reed's quarters]
 T'POL: You certainly took your time. He had this
pressed against my head. (A Suliban weapon.)
TUCKER: Had to be sure they were preoccupied. You positive you're
willing to do this? It could get pretty ugly.
REED: I'm positive.
TUCKER: You've got thirty minutes.
REED: Good luck.
T'POL: If they regain consciousness don't hesitate to use these. (The
hyposprays.)
HOSHI: Don't worry.
TUCKER: Let's go.(Reed makes it to Daniel's quarters after evading Suliban
patrols, and undoes the magnetic lock. Inside, he retrieves the
database projector from the back of a cupboard and leaves, replacing
the lock, turns and sees two Suliban.)
 [Bridge]
 SILIK: Did you think we wouldn't be watching
Daniels' quarters? (Reed has been beaten up.)
REED: I guess I wasn't thinking.
SILIK: I guess you weren't, but you should be thinking now. Thinking
about what will happen to you if you don't answer my questions. Are you
thinking about that Lieutenant Reed? Good. Now tell me what this is.
What does it do?
REED: I don't know. (He gets hit again.)
SILIK: What does it do?
REED: I don't know. Please!
SILIK: Yes?
REED: I was told to destroy it. I don't know what it does.
SILIK: Who told you to destroy it?
REED: Captain Archer, before he left. He didn't want you to find it.
SILIK: And why would that be?
REED: He thought you would use it to contact someone. I don't know who.
I swear it!
SILIK: Have the Lieutenant returned to his quarters.
 [Engineering]
 (Two Suliban are hit by weapons fire, and the
third is taken out by a Vulcan neck pinch.)
T'POL: Ready.
(Tucker rushes to the warp controls. Over on the Helix, Silik is trying
to use the future device.) [Bridge](Alarms are
going off.)RAAN: Engineering, how did this happen?
Engineering!
 [Helix - Temporal communications chamber]
 SILIK: What is it?
RAAN [OC]: The antimatter stream has been compromised.
SILIK: Shut down the warp reactor.
RAAN[OC]: Our engineers aren't responding. I've sent soldiers.
SILIK: Keep me informed. (He returns to the device. In Enterprise's Engineering the
monitors declare a core breach is in progress. The soldiers retreat as
bits start exploding.)
SILIK: Yes?
RAAN [OC]: These humans are greater fools than I thought.
 [Bridge]
 RAAN: They'd rather commit mass suicide than
submit to us.
SILIK [OC]: Did you correct the problem?
RAAN: It's too late. The reactor's going to breach.
 [Helix - Temporal communications chamber]
 SILIK: We can't endanger the Helix. Evacuate your
soldiers and have Enterprise towed out of the nebula.
 [Bridge]
 RAAN: There's very little time. Will you alert the
tractor teams?
 [Helix - Temporal communications chamber]
 SILIK: You do it. I'm busy. (Something
is trying
to come through on the time pad. The Suliban evacuate Enterprise and
pods tow her away from the Helix. A figure starts to appear on the
time pad. Silik looks like a
worshipper at an altar.)
SILIK: Is that you? Can you hear me?
(The Suliban pods sheer off as Enterprise's nacelles explode - or do
they? Suddenly they light up blue and she goes to warp.)
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Report, Ensign.
TRAVIS: The antimatter stream's back to normal.
T'POL: You may have overdone your pyrotechnic display. The scorching on
the starboard nacelle is extensive.
TUCKER: I'll try to remember that next time we have to fake a reactor
breach. (Hoshi is at T'Pol's station.)
HOSHI: Cell ships, thirty of them, thirty five,
approaching at high warp.
T'POL: Maintain your course and speed, Ensign.
 [Helix - Temporal communications chamber]
 SILIK: I've tried to reach you. I tried for two
days. I did what you told me, but Archer wasn't on Enterprise. There
was some kind of temporal signature. I need instructions. I don't know
how to operate this device. I need your help. (a shadow figure starts
to form) I hear you, but I don't understand. Repeat what you said.
Please, repeat what you said.
(The figure jumps off the pad and drop-kicks Silik.)
ARCHER: I said, you're an ugly bastard. (He puts Silik's own gun to his head.)
ARCHER: You try shape-shifting on me, or pulling one of your chameleon routines
and I promise you, Silik, I'll blow your head off. Has Enterprise left
the nebula?
SILIK: Can you see? I've brought you Archer! He's here! Archer's here!
There's no need to punish me.
ARCHER: Where's my ship, Silik?
SILIK: They've left. They're gone.
ARCHER: How many Cell ships did you send after them? Silik!
SILIK: I don't know. Twenty, thirty.
ARCHER: You're going to call them off, and then you're going to give me
those data discs back. Now get up.
SILIK: My soldiers won't let you leave.
ARCHER: Shut up. (He shoots up the time pad.) ARCHER: Get going.
 [Bridge]
 (Enterprise is under attack.)
TUCKER: Hoshi, any sign of the Vulcan ship?
HOSHI: Not yet. (Explosions.)
TRAVIS: Hull plating on the port-aft quarter's down.
T'POL: Alter course ten degrees starboard.
TRAVIS: They're closing.
(Tucker deploys a phase cannon and takes out one ship.)
HOSHI: The lead ships are overtaking us.
TRAVIS: Port hull plating's down. Ventral plating as well. (Then it
goes quiet.)
HOSHI: Why'd they stop firing?
TRAVIS: Why waste ammunition? They have us surrounded.
T'POL: Are long-range sensors still operational?
HOSHI: No Vulcan ship.
(The cell ships start to veer off.)
TRAVIS: Sub-Commander?
T'POL: I see them.
TUCKER: Son of a bitch, he did it.
TRAVIS: One Cell ship approaching aft.
T'POL: Stand down weapons. Open a channel. Enterprise to Suliban
vessel.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead, Enterprise.
TUCKER: Good to hear your voice, Captain.
 [Cell ship]
 ARCHER: Good to hear yours, too. I feel like I've
been away for a thousand years.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: Is everyone all right?
T'POL: Lieutenant Reed suffered some minor injuries, but he's
recovering in Sickbay. Captain, I'm curious. Why didn't the other Cell
ships try to stop you?
ARCHER [OC]: I know it's not standard Starfleet procedure
[Cell ship]
 ARCHER: But I took a hostage. (Silik is on the
floor by him.) ARCHER: By the time he wakes up, we'll be long gone.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: Request permission to dock.
T'POL: Permission granted.
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've joined the Vulcan ship D'kyr. It
seems that Starfleet and the High Command are eager to discuss the
future of our mission.
 [Bridge]
 SOVAL [on viewscreen]: While your explanation of
how you obtained these disks is somewhat implausible, it's obvious that
Enterprise was not responsible for the destruction of the colony.
ARCHER: It may see somewhat implausible to you, but
SOVAL [on viewscreen]: Please allow me to finish, Captain. In less than
a single Earth year you've engaged in armed conflicts with over a dozen
species. You've escalated the conflict between my people and the
Andorians which included the destruction of one of our most sacred
monasteries. You helped eighty nine Suliban escape from detention. You
may claim to be on a mission of exploration. I, however, consider you
reckless and irresponsible.
 [Starfleet Headquarters]
 SOVAL: A danger to the Quadrant. Regardless of the
evidence presented here, I plan to advise the Vulcan High Command not
to change its recommendation to Starfleet. Enterprise should be
recalled.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER: You guys have wanted to scrub this mission
from day one. We proved to you that we didn't kill those thirty six
hundred people, but you don't want to hear it. You're pathetic!
FORREST [on viewscreen]: That's enough, Commander.
 [Starfleet Headquarters]
 FORREST: No one's more pleased than I am that
Enterprise wasn't responsible for the tragedy, but Ambassador Soval's
argument may be valid. Starfleet Command has a difficult decision to
make here.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: When I was in my early twenties on a trip
to East Africa I saw a gazelle giving birth. It was truly amazing.
Within minutes the baby was standing up, standing up on its own. A few
more minutes and it was walking and before I knew it, it was running
alongside its mother, moving away with the herd. Humans aren't like
that, Ambassador. We may come from the same planet as those gazelles
but we're pretty much helpless when we're born. It takes us months
before we're able to crawl. Almost a full year before we can walk. Our
deep space mission isn't much different. We're going to stumble, make
mistakes, I'm sure more than a few, before we find our footing. But
we're going to learn from those mistakes. That's what being human is
all about. I'm sorry you can't see that.
 [Starfleet Headquarters]
 SOVAL: Your analogy is very colourful, Captain,
but I question whether it addresses the consequences of your actions.
T'POL [on viewscreen]: The concept of learning from one's mistakes
shouldn't be difficult for a Vulcan of your wisdom to understand,
Ambassador. Our ancestors
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Discovered how to suppress their volatile
emotions only after centuries of savage conflict. You spoke of the
destruction of the monastery. What about the Vulcan listening post that
Captain Archer found there? I would hope that our people have learned
from those events that using a sacred sanctuary to spy on others was a
dishonourable practice, to say the least. I don't wish to contradict
Captain Archer, but learning from one's mistakes is hardly exclusive to
humans. Their mission should be allowed to continue.
(The Vulcans sweep out of the room at Starfleet, and leave Enterprise's
Bridge as well.)
FORREST [on viewscreen]: The Command Council will review the evidence
and listen to what's been said here today. I'm sure they'll hear from
the Vulcans as well. I'll let you know as soon as there's a decision.
Good luck, Jonathan. All of you. (Ends transmission.)
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 (She's in bed when the door bell sounds.)
T'POL: Come in.
ARCHER: I can't be certain, but Crewman Fuller might have seen me
coming in here.
T'POL: She tends to be discreet. What can I do for you?
ARCHER: I think you put it over the top. Forrest said none of the
others could believe it when you went to bat for us, not to mention
that little listening-post lecture you gave to Soval.
T'POL: You spoke to the Admiral?
ARCHER: He woke me up in the middle of the night. Can you believe that?
T'POL: I assume with good news.
ARCHER: I think you put it over the top.
T'POL: I still don't believe in time travel.
ARCHER: The hell you don't.

  [Captain's
mess]
(Archer pours red wine into T'Pol's glass.) ARCHER: Say when. (At about one inch.)
T'POL: When.
ARCHER: I didn't know you drank wine.
T'POL: Under the circumstances I'll allow myself a small indulgence.
TUCKER: Make mine a large indulgence.
ARCHER: To our Science Officer. It's been one year to the day since you
officially joined our crew.
TUCKER: Here's to many more.
T'POL: I appreciate the sentiment but I'm simply carrying out my
assignment.
ARCHER: That's no small accomplishment considering the previous record
for a Vulcan serving on a human ship was two weeks.
T'POL: Ten days.
ARCHER: I've been filling out your annual crew evaluation. Just a
formality.
T'POL: I understand. The High Command has requested my evaluation of
you. Just a formality.
ARCHER: There's something in your record I've been meaning to ask you
about. While you were stationed in Sausalito you took a five-day leave.
T'POL: Yes?
ARCHER: You went to an old mining town in Pennsylvania, Carbon Creek?
Seems like an odd place to take a vacation.
T'POL: Vulcans don't take vacations.
ARCHER: Then, if I may ask, why'd you go there?
T'POL: Is this part of my evaluation?
ARCHER: Just curious.
T'POL: It was a personal matter.
TUCKER: You had a personal matter in Carbon Creek, Pennsylvania?
ARCHER: Trip, if she doesn't want to tell us.
TUCKER: Seems a little unfair. We tell her plenty of stories.
T'POL: You'd like me to tell you a story?
TUCKER: If it's a good one.
T'POL: I went to Carbon Creek because I wanted to visit the site of
First Contact between humans and Vulcans.
ARCHER: Then you were about three thousand kilometres off. That took
place in Montana.
T'POL: Actually, it didn't.
TUCKER: Every school kid knows that Zephram Cochrane met the Vulcans in
Bozeman, Montana, on April 5th, 2063. I've been there. There's a
statue.
T'POL: In fact, the Vulcans visited Earth long before then. My second
foremother was one of them.
TUCKER: Your who?
T'POL: My mother's mother's mother. Would you like to hear the story?
 [Vulcan ship]
 (Earth, October 1957 or later- you can tell
because Sputnik is in orbit.)
STRON: (middle aged man) I can't compensate.
MESTRAL: (younger man) The re-fusion pressure is still dropping.
CAPTAIN: (oldest man) If our orbit decays any further, we'll be
detected.
T'POL [OC]: They'd gone to Earth to investigate the launch of its first
artificial satellite, called Sputnik.
 [Captain's mess]
 T'POL: During their third week of gathering
information about humanity their impulse manifold began to malfunction.
They had no choice but to attempt an emergency landing.
 [Vulcan ship]
 CAPTAIN: Try to find an isolated area. Send a
distress call to the High Command.
(The ship burns through the atmosphere)
T'MIR: (played by Jolene) One hundred kilometres.
CAPTAIN: Deploy the stabilisers.
T'MIR: Our landing vector is too steep.
(A shooting star streaks through the night sky, explosions on the ship,
a crash on a hillside. The ship is a wreck, with fires everywhere,)
STRON: Are you hurt?
T'MIR: I don't think so. Captain. (He's dead.)
MESTRAL: (to T'Mir) What are your orders?
 [Captain's mess]
 ARCHER: Why did the Vulcans keep this a secret?
T'POL: The incident is well-documented at the Science Directorate and
the Space Council.
TUCKER: On Vulcan?
T'POL: Of course.
TUCKER: Hang on. T'Mir was your great-grandmother? I'd be the last
person to question your math, but aren't you missing a few generations?
Sputnik was two hundred years ago.
ARCHER: Don't forget how long Vulcans live.
TUCKER: Right. Just how old are you? (He gets a glare and turns to Archer.)
TUCKER: It's got to be in her record.
ARCHER: Trip, that's classified information. Please, go on.
T'POL: Their subspace transceiver was damaged in the crash. They had no
way of knowing if their distress signal had even been transmitted.
 [Pennsylvania]
 T'POL [OC]: They'd used up their emergency rations
within a week. After five days without food their situation was growing
desperate.
T'MIR: (scanner is beeping) Two lifeforms. (A couple of deer.)
T'MIR: Fascinating.
MESTRAL: One of those creatures could sustain us for some time.
STRON: Are you suggesting we eat it?
MESTRAL: It's logical to take extreme measures to survive.
STRON: Even resorting to savagery?
MESTRAL: That may not be necessary. Our scans showed a settlement
approximately six kilometres away.
T'MIR: If we're exposed, we could contaminate their culture.
MESTRAL: And when they find our bodies after we starve, will that
contaminate their culture?
STRON: Better to leave them with a mystery than with three living
aliens.
MESTRAL: We should at least investigate the possibilities.
T'MIR: It's too dangerous.
MESTRAL: I'm willing to take the risk. (Mestral walks off)
T'MIR: Mestral. (to Stron) Remain here.
 [Carbon Creek]
(The Vulcan's keep out of sight.)  T'MIR: How do you
suggest we proceed?
MESTRAL: We'll need to disguise ourselves.
(So they steal clothes off a line. T'Mir changes behind a sheet.)
T'MIR: We're here to find food, nothing else. We'll keep contact with
the humans to an absolute minimum. If we must interact with them I will
speak. (She comes out from behind the sheet trying to do up a dress.) T'MIR: What
is it?
MESTRAL: I believe you have that garment on backwards.
(They walk along the main street. Mistral has a woolly hat pulled down
over his ears and T'Mir has found a pair of shoes from somewhere too.
They see a group of men getting off a bus.)
T'MIR: Prisoners?
MESTRAL: They don't appear to be restrained. More likely labourers.
T'MIR: It's hard to believe these people were capable of launching an
artificial satellite.
(They hear a voice from a car radio and go to investigate the group of
men listening to the match.)
RADIO: And he gets the sigh, and here's the pitch. Dixon hits a
scorcher down the right field line. The first baseman takes a stab at
it, but no! Ellis is charging hard from right field. He scoops it up
and fires. It's going to be close. There's a collision at the plate,
but Wilcox hangs on to the ball and Thompson is out!
T'MIR: (walking on) Some type of combat, no doubt.
MESTRAL: I believe it may be an entertainment.
(The Pine Tree bar and grill.)
T'MIR: A communal gathering place.
MESTRAL: Do they have food?
T'MIR: It appears so. Remember.
MESTRAL: I won't speak. (He holds the door open for her.)
 [Pine Tree bar]
 (There's a pool table, and country music playing.
All the men look up when they enter.)
MAGGIE: Another?
BILLY: No, I'll settle up.
MAGGIE: All right.
BILLY: I'm next.
T'MIR: Currency.
MESTRAL: Yes. The paper appears to have value. (Billy puts some of his change in a jar.)
MAGGIE: Thanks, Billy. (to
T'Mir and Mestral) What can I get you?
T'MIR: Do you have anything that doesn't require currency?
MAGGIE: You mean free? (She puts a bowl of nuts in front of them and moves
away.)
BILLY: What brings you to Carbon Creek?
T'MIR: We had an accident with our vehicle outside your town. (Maggie returns with two glasses of water.)
MAGGIE: Are you okay?
T'MIR: We're fine.
MAGGIE: You folks married?
T'MIR: No. We're business associates.
BILLY: There's a gas station up the road. I'd be happy to give you a
lift.
T'MIR: No, thank you.
BILLY: Suit yourself. (He goes to the pool table.) BILLY: Anybody up for a game?
Quarter a ball?
JACK: (a student carrying books) I'll play.
BILLY: You better ask your mother, Jackie.
JACK: Come on, Mom, we could use the money.
MAGGIE: Go on upstairs and do your homework. I'll bring you up some
dinner.
MESTRAL: I'm up for a game.
T'MIR: What are you doing? I told you not to speak to anyone.
MESTRAL: I can defeat him.
T'MIR: You don't even know the rules.
MESTRAL: It's simple.
BILLY: I thought you didn't have any money.
T'MIR: He doesn't.
BILLY: Well, sorry, pal. There's nothing in it for me.
T'MIR: It's time for us to go.
BILLY: Wait a minute. We might be able to work something out. If you
win, I'll pay up. If I win, your business associate has a drink with
me.
MESTRAL: We accept your terms.
T'MIR: We do not.
MESTRAL: The game is based on simple geometry. It wouldn't challenge a
Vulcan child.
T'MIR: No.
MESTRAL: We need their currency.
T'MIR: What if you lose? I'll have to socialise with him.
MESTRAL: Would you rather die of starvation?
(So Mestral breaks.)
BILLY: Tough break. (Billy makes the first pot or three, then misses
and Mistral starts to clear the table.)
MESTRAL: The number eight ball in that pocket.
 (Main Street]
 (The pair walk out of Johnnie's Market store with
two brown bags full of groceries.)
MESTRAL: Cryogenics. (A frozen meal in a packet.) MESTRA:L Do you suppose they've
experimented with protein replicators?
T'MIR: Why didn't you ask the merchant? You seemed willing to engage
everyone else in conversation.
 [Captain's mess]
 TUCKER: I think that wine's gone to your head.
T'POL: What are you implying?
TUCKER: Two Vulcans stroll into a bar, hustle a few games of pool and
walk out with an armload of TV dinners. It sounds like an old episode
of The Twilight Zone.
T'POL: If you're not interested in hearing the rest (She starts to leave
the table.)
ARCHER: Hold on, hold on. We didn't say we weren't interested.
T'POL: They realised they couldn't rely on gambling
 [Pine Tree bar]
 (T'Mir is sweeping the floor.)
T'POL [OC]: So they took whatever employment they could find while they
waited for the rescue vessel to arrive.
(Stron is doing plumbing, and cheating by using his weapon to solder a
leaky U-bend, while Mestral has joined the miners underground.)
T'POL [OC]: But as the weeks passed, it seemed less likely that their
distress call had been received, and it became more difficult for them
to avoid the humans.
(Later,  a broadcast of the White Sands test is on the TV screen behind the
bar.)
TV: The test of a nuclear device is designed for tactical use in place
of artillery. Zero hour was just after five.
MAGGIE: (turning the TV off) Nothing like an atomic test to make your
day.
MESTRAL: Doesn't it concern you?
MAGGIE: The bomb? It scares the hell out of me.
MESTRAL: I'd hate to see humanity destroy itself.
MAGGIE: That makes two of us.
JACK: Want to shoot some eight ball?
MAGGIE: Jack.
JACK: I've got a geometry midterm next week. It's good practice.
MAGGIE: Nice try, but there's better ways to prepare for a math test.
MESTRAL: Are you interested in mathematics?
JACK: It's what I want to study at college. Mechanical engineering, if
I get to go.
MAGGIE: You will. He got a scholarship.
JACK: Only a partial one.
MAGGIE: It's still a scholarship and you worked hard for it.
Everybody's been pitching in to help pay for his expenses. Books, room
and board. (She puts a tip in the glass jar.) MAGGIE: You can shoot one rack and
that's it.
JACK: Your break.
 [Vulcan's apartment]
 (T'Mir is browsing through books while Mestral
watches a western on TV. Stron is wearing his hair long over his ears.)
STRON: This is the third time
this week I've had to fix Mrs. Garrett's sink.
MESTRAL: Perhaps she enjoys your company.
STRON: It might be tolerable if her son didn't insist on calling me
Moe.
T'MIR: Why does he do that?
STRON: There is a comic actor known as a Stooge with that name. The boy
believes we have similar hair.
MESTRAL: There is a resemblance.
STRON: This is intolerable. I'm a warp field engineer.
T'MIR: Then perhaps you can help me construct a subspace transceiver.
STRON: I told you, it's impossible.
T'MIR: If we remain here, we'll die. This world's on the brink of
self-annihilation.
MESTRAL: I don't believe that.
T'MIR: Because your fascination with this species is blinding you. You
sit for hours each day in front of this idiotic device.
MESTRAL: I'm doing research. Perhaps if you spent more time observing
human behaviour you might not have such a pessimistic view of them.
T'MIR: Open your eyes. They revel in violence. They devote what little
technology they have to devising ways of killing each other.
MESTRAL: So did we centuries ago. They just haven't realised their
potential yet.
T'MIR: What potential?
MESTRAL: They have great empathy and compassion. Look how we've been
made to feel welcome.
T'MIR: Only because they believe we're human. If they discovered the
truth do you think they'd be so compassionate? Where are you going?
MESTRAL: To the ship.
T'MIR: Why?
MESTRAL: This antenna is inadequate. I believe I can use a waveform
discriminator to enhance it.
T'MIR: It'll be safer to go after dark. You can't risk being followed.
MESTRAL: I need to go now. I Love Lucy is on tonight.
 [Main Street]
 (He pauses at a corner, and Maggie picks him up in
her car.)
MAGGIE: Hi, you're right on time.
(T'Mir watches them drive away together.)
 [Maggie's car]
 (Later, when the pair come back to Carbon Creek,
they talk in the car.)
MESTRAL: It was different than seeing it on television. More
invigorating.
MAGGIE: Well, there's another game next week if you'd like to go. Or we
could do something else. Take in a movie?
MESTRAL: That would be enjoyable.
MAGGIE: Can I ask you a question?
MESTRAL: Yes.
MAGGIE: What are you hiding under that cap? A pointed head? You're not
from Mars, are you? (Mestral's eyebrow twitches.) MAGGIE: Oh, I didn't mean to make fun
of you.
MESTRAL: I'm not offended. May I ask you a question?
MAGGIE: Please.
MESTRAL: What happened to your mate?
MAGGIE: You mean my husband?
MESTRAL: Yes.
MAGGIE: He left a long time ago. Jack used to get letters from him
every now and then. The last we heard, he'd moved to Phoenix. I was
hoping he would help with Jack's college but I guess we're on our own.
I can understand why he wouldn't want to have anything to do with me
but. I'm sorry, I'm usually better at keeping a lid on my emotions.
It's not always easy.
MESTRAL: I know.
MAGGIE: Well, I'm due back at the Pine Tree. Will I see you later? (He
nods. There's a pause then she kisses him.) MESTRAL Oh, I didn't mean to. I
thought, I thought. Oh, God.
MESTRAL: Please, I was simply surprised. It was very pleasant.
MAGGIE: Pleasant?
MESTRAL: Wasn't that an appropriate response?
MAGGIE: Well, it's been a while since I kissed a man, but still, I was
hoping it'd be a little bit more than pleasant.
MESTRAL: I did say very pleasant. (Maggie spotting T'Mir watching them.)
MAGGIE: We've got company.
MESTRAL: I should go. Thank you again.(He gets out of the car.)
 [Main Street]
 T'MIR: Waveform discriminator?
MESTRAL: I went to a baseball game in Doylestown.
T'MIR: More research?
MESTRAL: Maggie invited me. I didn't think it would be a problem.
T'MIR: Then why did you lie about it?
MESTRAL: Because I knew you wouldn't understand.
T'MIR: You were engaging in intimate activity.
MESTRAL: I didn't initiate it.
T'MIR: You're to have no further contact with that woman.
MESTRAL: You can't make that decision.
T'MIR: I'm still in command.
MESTRAL: Command of what? Our mission is over. It's time to accept the
fact that we may never leave this world.
 [Pine Tree bar]
 (The bar is closed, and T'Mir is going around the
tables blowing out the candles when she pauses and sits down.)
JACK: I was just going to play some pool. I didn't mean to bother you.
What are you doing?
T'MIR: I was about to meditate.
JACK: Really? Are you just trying to clear your mind, or reach a higher
spiritual plane? I spend a lot of time at the library.
T'MIR: Studying meditation techniques?
JACK: Different things. Mostly about places I'd like to visit, like
Tibet. The Buddhist monks there meditate every day. And in India,
they're got these mystics called fakirs. Supposedly they can almost
stop their hearts just by using willpower.
T'MIR: You'd be surprised what a disciplined mind can accomplish. What
else do you study at this library?
JACK: Astronomy, literature. Sometimes I'll just pick a book off the
shelf and start reading. What about you, what do you like to read?
T'MIR: I have an interest in astronomy as well.
JACK: Oh really? Did you know that minutes after dusk, when the sun is
just right you can see Sputnik with the naked eye. Maybe tomorrow I
could show you.
T'MIR: I've seen it already.
JACK: Oh. It's amazing, don't you think? Well, I'll let you get back to
your meditating. It was nice talking to you.
T'MIR: And you.
 [Mine]
 BILLY: Mestral!
MESTRAL: Hello.
BILLY: Hey, I got tickets to the ball game this weekend. It's a
double-header. Tim's going, Gavin, Jack, Maggie.
MESTRAL: I'm afraid I can't.
BILLY: What's wrong with you lately? Maggie says you haven't even
(An explosion knocks the two men down in a cloud of coal dust.)
MESTRAL: Are you all right, Billy?
BILLY: Yeah.
(Miners rush to leave the mine, in a panic.)
 [Vulcan ship]
 T'MIR: Why do you need us here?
MESTRAL: I'm looking for a particle weapon. The armoury case, help me
find it.
STRON: Why?
MESTRAL: There's been an accident in the mine. At least twenty men are
trapped. It could take the humans days to free them.
T'MIR: We can't interfere.
MESTRAL: They'll die. You'd let them suffocate. even if we could
prevent it.
STRON: What if they see the weapon?
MESTRAL: We'll be certain they don't.
T'MIR: At best, these humans only live to be sixty or seventy. Is it
worth the risk just to extend their lives a few more years?
STRON: We can't contaminate their culture.
MESTRAL: This has nothing to do with contamination. It has to do with
compassion.
T'MIR: Compassion is an emotion.
MESTRAL: They're my friends, and I'm going to help them. Don't try to
stop me.
 [Mine]
 (Underground, rescue workers are using
jack-hammers and pickaxes to try and get at the men trapped behind the
rock fall. Mestral sneaks behind the controlled chaos, then heads down
another tunnel. His communicator beeps.)
MESTRAL: Yes.
 [Above ground]
 T'MIR: Proceed twenty two metres, then turn right
at the junction.
MESTRAL [OC]: Understood.
 [Mine]
 T'MIR [OC]: In eight metres, you'll find a narrow
opening near the ground that leads to an abandoned shaft.
MINER: (rushing past Mestral) I think we're getting more guys down
there.
MINER 2: Is the ride free up there?
MINER: Yeah.
(Mestral finds a small, well supported shaft and crawls along it on
hands and knees.)
T'MIR [OC]: There's a stratum of quartz on the wall, opposite the
opening.
MESTRAL: I see it.
 [Above ground]
 T'MIR: Set your dispersal radius to seven degrees.
(Mestral starts firing his weapon.) T'MIR: Two more metres.
 [Mine]
(Mestral steps through the opening he has
made.)  MESTRAL: How far?
 [Above ground]
 T'MIR: Approximately thirty metres.
 [Mine]
 (Mestral makes his way to the trapped men.)
MINER 3: Here, over here.
T'POL [OC]: After rescuing the twelve miners, Mestral became something
of a hero that day.
 [Captain's mess]
 ARCHER: Didn't people wonder how he got them out?
T'POL: I'm sure they did, but no one ever discovered the truth. Three
months passed
 [Vulcan's apartment]
 T'POL [OC]: And just as they had resigned
themselves to the fact that, in all likelihood, they would never leave
Earth.
(T'Mir is reading, Mestral watching TV, and Stron trying to construct a
subspace transceiver out of bearskins and, well, you know, when the
communicator in the cupboard starts beeping.)
T'MIR: T'Mir.
TELLUS [OC]: This is Captain Tellus of Vulcan Survey vessel D'Vahl. I'm
responding to your distress signal.
T'MIR: We thought it wasn't transmitted.
TELLUS [OC]: Your signal was picked up by a Tellarite freighter. It
took them some time to forward it to the High Command. We're
approaching the system now. Meet us at the crash site in three days.
T'MIR: Understood.
 [Pine Tree bar - outside]
 (Jack pulls up in Maggie's car while T'Mir is
sweeping leaves.)
JACK: I hear you're leaving.
T'MIR: That's correct.
JACK: Where to?
T'MIR: Home. Up north.
JACK: I'm going to miss you. You're about the most interesting people
I've met in this town.
T'MIR: I'm sure you'll meet a lot of interesting people at college.
JACK: I'm not going.
T'MIR: What? Why not?
JACK: We couldn't come up with the rest of the money. The deadline for
the tuition's Friday, so
T'MIR: What will you do? JACK: Keep saving, I guess. Find a job. Mom
doesn't want me anywhere near the mine but that's where the work is
around here.
T'MIR: Can you try again next year for the scholarship?
JACK: I'll reapply, but there's no guarantee.
T'MIR: I'm sure they will offer it to you again.
JACK: And if not, there's always the library. Still a lot of books I
haven't read. Good luck up north. Carbon Creek's not exactly a vacation
spot, but I hope you'll come visit us.
T'MIR: Perhaps. (Maggie has been listening at the door.)
MAGGIE: He took those college
boards, got the highest score of anybody in the county. it's not fair.(On the Vulcan ship, T'Mir searchs for something, and eventually
finds it, then she takes a train journey to Pittsburgh.)
 [Bad Creek Manufacturing and Sales Co]
 BUSINESSMAN: So, you're the lady with the
invention that's going to change the world.
(She hands him a pouch fastened by Velcro. He tries it a few times, and
beams. She leaves with a sheaf of bank notes.)
 [Pine Tree bar]
 MAGGIE: Morning. (Then she sees all the bank notes
in Jack's college fund jar.) MAGGIE: Jack! Jack!
 [Vulcan's apartment]
 (T'Mir is washing up, Mestral is sweeping the
floor and Stron is working on something.)
T'MIR: Didn't you terminate your employment?
STRON: Yes, but I promised Mrs. Garrett I'd repair this suction device.
MESTRAL: It's unfortunate that you'll be leaving these people without
experiencing one thing they have to offer.
STRON: Such as alcohol, frozen fish sticks, the constant threat of
nuclear annihilation?
MESTRAL: There's much more to them. You just refuse to see it.
STRON: I've seen enough.
MESTRAL: I haven't. I plan to stay here.
STRON: If this is your attempt at humour
MESTRAL: They're on the verge of countless social and technological
advancements. I have the unique opportunity to study an emerging
species.
STRON: That's what you've done, much closer than we anticipated. Your
duty is to return to Vulcan and report your findings.
MESTRAL: There's still more to learn about these people.
T'MIR: All of them or just one?
MESTRAL: This has nothing to do with Maggie. She has helped me
appreciate their culture, but I don't intend to remain in Carbon Creek.
T'MIR: Where would you go?
MESTRAL: To one of their larger cities at first. After that, I'm not
certain. There's so much to see.
STRON: The High Command will never allow it. Tell him it's not
possible. T'Mir?
T'MIR: Perhaps I can arrange for you to be on the next survey ship.
MESTRAL: In another twenty years, running more statistical scans from
high orbit? That's not enough.
 [Crash site - night]
 TELLUS: Where is your captain?
T'MIR: He was killed in the crash.
TELLUS: There were four Vulcans aboard your vessel.
T'MIR: Mestral died in the crash as well. We cremated their remains.
 [Captain's mess]
 TUCKER: Do you realise you've just rewritten our
history books?
T'POL: A footnote, at best.
TUCKER: Footnote? This is like finding out Neil Armstrong wasn't the
first man to walk on the moon.
T'POL: Perhaps he wasn't.
ARCHER: How long did this Mestral stay on Earth?
T'POL: The rest of his life, presumably.
ARCHER: And that would be what, another hundred, hundred and fifty
years?
T'POL: Possibly longer.
TUCKER: An alien is left on Earth in the 1950s, lives through, what,
thirty Presidents? Travels the world, and no one notices him? And what
happened when he finally kicked the bucket? Did the undertaker just
shrug and ignore his ears?
T'POL: You asked me to tell you a story.
TUCKER: And it was a good one. But did it really happen?
T'POL: As I said, you asked me to tell you a story.
TUCKER: Damn, Captain, she put one over on us.
ARCHER: You did go to Carbon Creek.
T'POL: If you check my record, you'll note that I also visited
Yellowstone Park and the Carlsbad Caverns. I'm a scientist. That
includes geology. Thank you for the meal.
ARCHER: My pleasure. You've certainly kept us entertained.
T'POL: Good night.(In her quarters, preparing for her meditation
before sleep, T'Pol takes something out of a cupboard. It is the
handbag T'Mir was carrying when she took the Velcro pouch to
Pittsburgh.)

 Original Airdate: 2 Oct, 2002
 
 [Mess hall]
 (A nervous Malcolm Reed walks through to the
Captain's mess door and rings the bell.)
ARCHER [OC]: Come in.
 [Captain's mess]
 ARCHER: Good morning.
REED: Captain.
ARCHER: Sleep well?
REED: Well enough.
ARCHER: I wasn't sure what you wanted for breakfast, so I took the
liberty of having Chef prepare his famous Eggs Benedict.
REED: That'll be fine, sir. (Archer sits.)
ARCHER: You plan to eat standing up? (Reed sits.) ARCHER: This isn't a
visit to the principal's office, Malcolm. At ease.
REED: Thank you, sir. I just wasn't sure whether you called me here to
discuss something.
ARCHER: No. No business. I just wanted to have a long overdue meal with
my Armoury Officer. (Breakfast is served.) ARCHER: I heard that England made it
to the finals in the World Cup.
REED: I beg your pardon?
ARCHER: The World Cup? Soccer?
REED: Oh. I'm afraid I don't much follow football, sir.
ARCHER: Any sports you do follow?
REED: No, not particularly.
ARCHER: Thanks.
CREWMAN: You're welcome, sir. (He leaves.)
REED: I've been working on the duty roster, sir. We only have two
crewmen assigned to the Armoury full time. If we added a third, Ensign
Tanner would be free to begin those upgrades to those torpedo launchers
I told you about.
ARCHER: Didn't your mother ever tell you not to bring your homework to
the table?
REED: Sir?
ARCHER: This looks fine. (comm. beeps) Archer.
T'POL [OC]: I'm sorry to interrupt, Captain, but we've detected an
uncharted system along our present course. One of the planets is
Minshara-Class.
ARCHER: Take us out of warp. I'm on my way. Looks like we'll have to
reschedule.
REED: Whenever it's convenient. After you, sir.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Anybody home?
T'POL: It's uninhabited.
ARCHER: What about geographical features? Anything interesting?
T'POL: There's a chain of volcanoes that spans an entire hemisphere.
ARCHER: Well, I don't know about anyone else, but I could use some
fresh air. Put us in a standard orbit.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: Find a volcano with a gentle slope. Preferably one that's not
erupting. Prep a shuttlepod, Travis. We'll take shifts down to (An
explosion rocks Enterprise and sends people flying. We see the exterior
shot of a portion of port hull blown away.)
ARCHER: Report!
REED: It was a thermo-kinetic explosion on the outer hull, port forward
quarter. Breeches on C deck, D deck. (T'Pol discovers Hoshi is unconscious.)
T'POL: Bridge to Sickbay. We need medical
assistance.
PHLOX [OC]: Acknowledged.
ARCHER: Emergency bulkheads?
REED: They're in place, but eight subsections have decompressed.
ARCHER: Was anybody in them?
REED: I can't tell, sir. Not yet.
ARCHER: Find out what happened. Malcolm!
REED: I'd give you an answer if I could, sir. The sensor logs aren't
showing anything. All systems were functioning normally.
ARCHER: Archer to Engineering.
 [Engineering]
 (A scene of barely controlled chaos and electrical
fires.)
TUCKER: Captain, what's going on?
ARCHER [OC]: I was hoping you could tell me.
TUCKER: We've got plasma fires, an overload in the EPS grid but
whatever caused that explosion,
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER [OC]: I don't have a clue. Weapons fire? An
asteroid?
ARCHER: Nothing on our sensors. How are your people?
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: A few bumps and bruises, but we're all
right.
ARCHER [OC]: Keep me posted. Archer out.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Any casualty reports?
REED: Figures are coming in, sir. Seventeen so far, including Hoshi. No
fatalities.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: Get this man into the imaging chamber.
CREWWOMAN: What's happening? Are we under attack?
PHLOX: I don't know.
CREWMAN: Doctor! (More casualties are being brought in.)
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Captain, something just struck the ship.
Starboard side upper aft quadrant.
ARCHER: Can you get a visual? (The viewscreen image pans around the
saucer section.) ARCHER: There. Just behind the secondary plasma vent. You see
it? (The image is sparkling and fuzzy.)
TRAVIS: Some kind of cloaked ship?
ARCHER: It's too small.
T'POL: I'm not reading any biosigns. (The image solidifies.)
REED: It's armed with tricobalt explosives. I
think it's a mine. And judging by the firepower, something similar
damaged our ship.
ARCHER: Can you tell if it's active?
REED: No reason to believe it's not.
T'POL: Captain, it's lodged near Impulse Reactor Two. An explosion
anywhere near there could disable Enterprise.
ARCHER: What if we polarised the adjacent hull plating?
REED: We don't know how it's triggered. Somebody has to go out there
and defuse it, and it should be me. I have the ordnance training.
(Archer nods and Reed leaves.)
ARCHER: I've never heard of a minefield with just two mines. Are the
quantum beacons still mounted on the grappler arm?
TRAVIS: I believe so.
ARCHER: Lower them into position, then modify the viewscreen. Activate
the beacon.
T'POL: They were designed to penetrate Suliban cloaking devices. I'll
try shifting the phase variance.
 [Airlock]
 (Suited up and ready for EVA)
REED: Lieutenant Reed to Bridge. I've opened the outer hatch. Wish me
luck. (Weightlessness lifts him out.)
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: I'm detecting something in the gamma
spectrum, phase variant point zero zero seven five.
(A large number of mines appear on the viewscreen.)
 [Hull]
(Reed carefully walks around the mine.)  REED: Its
surface is pockmarked. Probably micrometeorite impacts. It seems to
have been in orbit for some time. The spikes are magnetic. Two of them
have locked onto the hull.
 [Bridge]
 REED [OC]: Stand by. I'm going to run an internal
scan.
 [Hull]
 REED: There are proximity sensors, but they appear
to be offline.
 [Bridge]
 REED [OC}: It looks like the mine doesn't think
it's hit anything. I believe I've found an access panel. I'm going to
try and remove it and get a look inside.
(Tucker enters the Bridge.)
ARCHER: How bad is it?
TUCKER: I can't really tell until we can get into the decompressed
sections but I imagine it's pretty ugly. I've got one piece of good
news. I did a head count. We didn't lose anyone.
ARCHER: Trip, I'm not sure Malcolm's going to be able to defuse this
thing. Couldn't we just detach that section of hull plating? Let it
drift away?
TUCKER: We'd have to reroute some EPS conduits. There's about three hundred bolt
couplings. It could be done.
ARCHER: How long?
TUCKER: Three or four hours. But I wouldn't recommend it, sir. We'd be
exposing a good piece of the impulse manifold.
ARCHER: Get a team started. I'll consider it our last resort.
REED [OC]: I'm removing the panel.
 [Hull]
 REED: The arming mechanism's extending. (He turns to
see a vessel approaching.) REED: Captain.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: We see it, Malcolm. (On the viewscreen is a
silhouette familiar to original series fans.) ARCHER: Ever see a ship like that?
T'POL: No. It's reflecting our scans.
ARCHER: Why didn't the beacons let us see through its cloak?
T'POL: Perhaps the mines use a more primitive cloaking system.
TRAVIS: Sir, they're hailing us.
(T'Pol goes to Hoshi's station and soon an alien language comes through
the speakers.)
T'POL: The translator's not locking on.
ARCHER: Archer to Sickbay.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: Yes, Captain.
ARCHER [OC]: Is Hoshi in any shape to return to the Bridge? It's urgent.
PHLOX: I'm afraid not. She suffered a rather severe concussion.
ARCHER [OC]: Understood. (Hoshi rolls over and sits up.)
HOSHI: Tell him I'm on my way.
PHLOX: You'd be of little help in your present condition, Ensign.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Any luck?
T'POL: Not yet.
TRAVIS: They're charging weapons. (A shot is fired.) TRAVIS: They missed our
starboard nacelle by less than twenty metres.
ARCHER: Not a very subtle warning shot.
(A second shot whizzes over Malcolm's head.)
ARCHER: Can you get us out of here?
TRAVIS: The orbits of those mines are pretty erratic, sir. It's going
to be tricky.
ARCHER: We'll give you whatever help we can. Bridge to Lieutenant Reed.
REED [OC]: Go ahead.
ARCHER: Our friends seem to be anxious for us to leave. We're going to
break orbit, nice and slowly.
 [Hull]
 REED: Understood. If you plan to go to warp, sir,
you'll let me know?
ARCHER [OC]: I'll try to remember.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Maneuvering thrusters only.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir. (A joystick comes out for him to steer with.)
ARCHER: Activate the beacon.
(The Bird of Prey cloaks as Enterprise steers gently between the mines.)
 [Hull]
 REED: Our friends just vanished.
ARCHER [OC]: That doesn't mean they're not still close.
 [Bridge]
 REED [OC]: Lieutenant Reed to Bridge.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
 [Hull]
 REED: I've identified four separate detonation
circuits. If I can isolate them in the proper sequence, I should be
able to deactivate the mine. It'll take some doing, but to be honest,
Captain, it's only a theory.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: How good a theory?
REED [OC]: The closest thing I'm familiar with that this device
resembles is a Triton-Class spatial torpedo. I've disarmed at least
half a dozen of those. I believe I can do it, sir.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: I've got Trip working on a backup plan,
but I'd prefer not to use it. Right now, you're our best bet. Be
careful, Malcolm.
(T'Pol looks at Travis.)
TRAVIS: I see it. (He makes a slow but sharp turn.)
 [Hull]
 (The mine reacts to the manoeuvre.)
REED: Bridge.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Go ahead.
REED [OC]: Another one of those spikes I told you about.
ARCHER: What about it?
 [Hull]
 REED: It just magnetised itself to the hull.
ARCHER [OC]: Is there a problem? (Reed's stiff upper lip is trembling with agony.)
REED: On its way it went through
my leg, sir.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: I'm on my way, Lieutenant. (to T'Pol) The
Bridge is yours.
TUCKER: Captain, I should be the one to go out there. I'm the engineer.
ARCHER: That's why I need you here, Trip.
 [Deleted scene - Sickbay - not
really sure where it actually belongs, but this is as good a place as
any]
 (Hoshi tries to get up)
PHLOX: Ensign, lie still. Your injuries don't appear to be serious.
Present circumstances, however, should not keep up from continuing our
Denobulan lessons. What about anatomy? Let's begin with the thyroid
gland.
HOSHI: The thyroid gland?
PHLOX: In Denobulan.
HOSHI: (something)
PHLOX: Very good. How about the hypothalamus?
HOSHI: (something)
PHLOX: Excellent. Now the xiphoid process. That's a difficult one.
(gives her a hypo)
HOSHI: (something)
PHLOX: No. No, that could be misinterpreted as big toe. The proper term
would be (something). All right, let's try something simpler.
Pericardia.
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox speaks to a crewman with gashed arm.)  PHLOX: You'll have to
wait in line for my osmotic eel to cauterise your wound. He's getting
quite a workout today.
HOSHI: Doctor.
PHLOX: Ensign.
HOSHI: They need a translator. I should be at my post.
PHLOX: I realise you're anxious to help but you wouldn't make it to the
turbolift. If you'd like, I could have them bring the comm. logs here.
HOSHI: Thank you, Doctor.
 [Hull]   
(Archer arrives at the scene of the incident.)
 ARCHER: Thought you might need a hand.
REED: Actually, I'd prefer a leg. (Archer opens a case.)
ARCHER: Let's see what we can do with the one you got.
(scanning) Could have been worse. It missed the bone, and it looks like
the pressure from the spike is keeping the wound from bleeding too
much. You'll be in Sickbay in no time. These should cut right through
it.
REED: Actually, sir, I wouldn't do that. My scans show detonation
circuits inside the spikes. I would consider letting you amputate, but
if Chef got hold of it he'd be serving Roast Reed for Sunday dinner.
Just give me something for the pain and I'll do my best to reach the
access panel.
ARCHER: Not without doing more damage to that leg.
REED: What's more important, my leg or your ship?
ARCHER: I intend to save both.
REED: I don't see how.
ARCHER: That backup plan I was telling you about? I asked Trip to
prepare to detach this section of hull plating. Seemed like a good idea
at the time.
REED: It's still a good idea.
ARCHER: Not with you attached to it. (He gives Reed a hypospray)
REED: I hope that's an anaesthetic.
ARCHER: Phlox's own recipe.
REED: (as it takes effect) Please, sir, may I have some more?
ARCHER: I don't want you too sedated. I'm going to need your help.
Someone's got to defuse this thing. You're going to talk me through it.
REED: With all due respect, Captain, disarming mines is extremely
delicate business. I'm trained for it. You're not.
ARCHER: I'm a quick study.
REED: It's too dangerous.
ARCHER: In case you haven't noticed, Lieutenant we're sitting about
five metres from an impulse reactor. I'm not leaving until we take this
weapon offline.
REED: Sir.
ARCHER: The way I see it, you don't have much choice. You're sort of
stuck here. So would you let me get started?
REED: I hope you've got a steady hand.
 [Sickbay]
(Hoshi listens to the alien recording.)  HOSHI: They're
ordering us to leave their system immediately or they'll destroy us.
TUCKER: Charming. Could you figure out a way to compose a message back,
explaining we're going as fast as we can?
HOSHI: I can try.
T'POL: And their next message?
HOSHI: They say they've annexed this planet in the name of something
called The Romalin Star Empire.
T'POL: Romulan. It's pronounced Romulan.
 [Hull]
 ARCHER: Romulans? I read about them when I was
with Daniels.
TUCKER [OC]: What'd you find out?
ARCHER: Not much. Just the name. He wouldn't let me see anything else.
T'Pol?
 [Sickbay]
 T'POL: They're rumoured to be an aggressive,
territorial species but the Vulcan High Command has never made direct
contact with them. Ensign Sato's translation says that
 [Hull]
 T'POL [OC]: They're demanding that we withdraw
from this system immediately.
ARCHER: That's going to be a little tough to do at the moment. Is there
any way you can explain our situation?
 [Sickbay]
 T'POL: She believes she'll have a reply prepared
within the hour.
TUCKER: How's it going out there, Captain?
ARCHER [OC]: We've taken two of the detonation circuits offline. Three
more to go. Keep me posted.
 [Hull]
(Reed looks at a scanner display.)  REED: The next one's
going to be tricky. Do you see the Y-shaped components surrounding the
circuit?
ARCHER: There's six of them.
REED: Right. Those are timing relays. You'll have to rotate each one
counterclockwise seventy degrees, but it has to be done in the proper
order. I'll guide you through it. Start with the relay to your upper
right. Raise it one centimetre and then turn it seventy degrees
counterclockwise. Good. Now pull it out slowly. Be careful not to touch
the housing. Well done. Now complete that set on the diagonal.
ARCHER: So, where were we?
REED: Sir?
ARCHER: This morning, at breakfast, before we were interrupted. You
said you didn't follow any particular sport.
REED: Well, I'm afraid I haven't started following one since breakfast,
sir. Now, go to the relay top centre, but watch that one. I believe it
may be damaged. It'll need some extra torque to deactivate it.
ARCHER: How about hobbies? Any hobbies?
REED: No, not really, sir.
ARCHER: I could've sworn I've seen you reading a book or two in the
mess hall.
REED: Sir, do you really think that this is the appropriate time for a
chat?
ARCHER: It helps me focus. It calms my nerves.
REED: Well, it isn't calming mine.
ARCHER: Sorry. It made you a little nervous this morning, too, didn't
it? Why is that?
REED: If you must know, I was honoured to be asked to sit at your
table. I just wasn't entirely comfortable having a casual meal with my
captain. I was trained not to fraternise with superior officers.
ARCHER: Never too late to learn.
REED: Frankly, sir, from my point of view that kind of socialising has
no place on a starship.
ARCHER: I had a CO once felt the same way. They're your crew, not your
friends. I thought about that a lot when I took this command, but then
I realised this is not your typical mission. We could be out here for
years. All we have to depend on is each other.
REED: There are two left. Top left first.
ARCHER: I appreciate your suggestions, Malcolm. Anything else?
REED: Well, since you asked. Bridge protocols have become somewhat lax.
Too many people offering opinions. We're here to carry out your orders,
sir. You're the Captain.
ARCHER: What's the point of having a senior staff if they just sit
around with their mouths shut? I'm glad they have opinions. I rely on
them. Keep going.
REED: And in the area of security I sometimes think you could show a
little more caution, sir.
ARCHER: I'm aware of your concerns in that area.
REED: Not to say that it hasn't been a privilege to have served with
you.
ARCHER: Ah ha.
REED: Sir?
ARCHER: You're talking in the past tense, Lieutenant. (He deactivates the
sixth relay.)
REED: Now, reinsert all six relays, but in the reverse order. You're
doing fine, sir.
ARCHER: Thanks.
 [Bridge]
 (Yhe mines disappear from the viewscreen.)
TUCKER: You've earned yourself a break, Travis. Ensign Hutchison can
cover the helm for a while.
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir, but I'd prefer to stay at my post.
T'POL: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
 [Hull]
 T'POL [OC]: We're clear of the minefield.
ARCHER: Maintain course and speed.
T'POL: Understood.
REED: This last detonation circuit has an added attraction. I'm seeing
something that looks like a back-up arming mechanism. We'll have to
fool the circuit into thinking it's still online.
ARCHER: How do we do that?
REED: There's a hyperspanner in the equipment case. Take out its power
cell and strip off the casing.
ARCHER: You must have realised this wasn't going to be your typical
armory posting. That my command style lacked a certain spit and polish.
REED: It was obvious, if you don't mind me saying so.
ARCHER: Strange.
REED: What's strange, sir?
ARCHER: I understand you came from a long line of Royal Navy men. Your
father, your grandfather. Why pick Starfleet? Why not continue the
family tradition?
REED: God knows I tried.
ARCHER: What happened?
REED: I'll need a circuit probe.
ARCHER: So, what happened?
REED: (working on the power cell) I was raised on the water. I knew how
to handle a boat before I could ride a bicycle. Studied all the great
naval battles. I don't know. I suppose I thought I'd just grow out of
it.
ARCHER: Grow out of what?
REED: Aquaphobia.
ARCHER: You're afraid of the water?
REED: More precisely, afraid of drowning.
ARCHER: So instead of a life on the sea you chose a life in the vacuum
of space? (Archer goes back to the mine with the power cell.)
REED: I had a
great-uncle who suffered from the same problem, but he faced his fears.
Joined the Navy, had a distinguished career. All you have to do is
attach it to the cylinder on your upper right. It's working. Start with
the topmost component. Use the caliper to lift it a few millimetres and
then turn it clockwise three hundred and sixty degrees, and then gently
reinsert it. He was something of a hero to me, my great-uncle. (Archer does as he's told.)
ARCHER: The one with aquaphobia?
REED: Indeed. He signed up with the submarine service.
ARCHER: Talk about facing your deepest fears.
REED: He was a brave man. Wasn't long before he'd worked his way up
through the ranks. Made chief engineer on the HMS Clement. Do you know
the story of the Clement, sir?
ARCHER: I don't think I do. (He completes disarming that segment of the
mine.)
REED: Good. Now, the other five components. Repeat the same process on
each one, counterclockwise.
ARCHER: You were telling me about the Clement.
REED: They were on a routine patrol when they had an accident. Now,
there's a beautiful irony for you. They hit a mine left over from some
world war. There they were, trapped underneath an ice shelf, several
compartments flooding, including Engineering. Can you imagine? My
great-uncle, the man afraid of drowning? The ship was sinking, losing
power. According to his lieutenant, my great-uncle sealed himself in
the engine room and kept the reactor online long enough for his crew to
make it to the escape pods. He went down with his ship. He did what he
had to do to save his crewmates.
ARCHER: I appreciate what you're trying to tell me, Malcolm, but I was
hoping you'd be able to save your heroics for another time.
REED: I just want you to know, sir, that I am prepared.
ARCHER: Got you.
REED: If we're not able to defuse this mine, the safety of the crew
ARCHER: I said I heard you, Lieutenant.
REED: I'm afraid we have another problem, sir.
ARCHER: What? What is it?
REED: I need to use the bathroom.
ARCHER: I won't tell a soul.
REED: In my EV suit, sir? (Laughter fades as two Romulan warbirds
decloak.) REED: Sir.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: We're being hailed.
ROMULAN [OC]: You've ignored our warnings.
T'POL: We were unable to translate your language until a short time
ago. We're trying to defuse a weapon lodged on our hull.
ROMULAN [OC]: I'm well aware of your situation. Our scans show you're
prepared to detach the hull segment surrounding the mine. Complete the
procedure and leave this system immediately.
TUCKER: We've got a man trapped out there. Don't your scans show you
that?
ROMULAN [OC]: One crewman. You have eighty two others safely aboard.
Jettison the hull segment and leave. We will not tolerate espionage.
(The ships recloak.)
ARCHER [OC]: T'Pol, report.
T'POL: They're demanding that we jettison the section of hull plating
and leave.
TUCKER: They scanned us, Captain. They know we're ready to detach it.
 [Hull]
 ARCHER: I'm defusing the last detonation circuit.
Stand by. (a large section starts rising from the top of the mine)
REED: It's rearming! Reset that last component! Quickly!
ARCHER: (he does) Lieutenant?
REED: When you deactivated that final circuit, it triggered a sub
detonator.
ARCHER: How can we get to it?
REED: We can't. It's too deep inside. We'd have to dismantle the entire
mine. Captain? Those heroics we spoke about. I think it may be time.
You've done all you can, sir. For what it's worth, you'd make a fine
Armoury Officer.
ARCHER: Show me that sub-detonator.
REED: I'd prefer a burial at sea, if I'm not completely vaporised.
ARCHER: I thought you were afraid of the water. Your scanner,
Lieutenant.
REED: (handing it over) I told you, sir. There's nothing we can do.
ARCHER: We'll dismantle this thing piece by piece if we have to.
REED: That'll take days.
ARCHER: My schedule's open.
REED: And these Romulans? They don't seem like the patient types. The
longer we stay in this system, the more likely they're going to attack.
As much as I appreciate all your efforts, you have to detach the hull
plating. It's the only option.
ARCHER: I'm not about to leave one of my crew behind.
REED: You're putting Enterprise at risk.
ARCHER: We're wasting time. Help me figure out a way to get you off of
here. That's an order. (Reed disconnects his air hose.) ARCHER: What the hell
are you doing? (He lets the scanner float away as he goes to reconnect it,
then sees Reed has almost zero air left now.) ARCHER: Great. (He connects his own
air supply to Reed's.) ARCHER: If I were the kind of captain you think I should
be, I'd bust your ass back to crewman.
REED: Begging your pardon, sir, but if you were that kind of captain we
wouldn't be having this conversation. You'd have cut me loose by now.
ARCHER: I'm not going to do that, Malcolm. When we triggered that sub-detonator, why didn't the mine explode right away? (He disconnects the
replenishment hose.) ARCHER: How many seconds went by before I rearmed it?
REED: Sir?
ARCHER: How many seconds?
REED: I don't remember. Ten, maybe twelve.
ARCHER: It felt more like twenty.
REED: Ten, twenty, what's the difference?
ARCHER: If it had exploded, how big would the yield have been?
REED: Judging by the damage the first mine caused, I'd guess about a
quarter of a kiloton. What are you getting at, sir?
 [Airlock]
 ARCHER: How close is your team to finishing?
TUCKER: They're down to the last few couplings. What's going on out
there?
ARCHER: We're going to detach the plating.
T'POL: I'm sure you did everything you could, Captain.
ARCHER: I'm going with him. Can a shuttle pod hatch withstand a
quarter-kiloton blast?
TUCKER: Depends how close it was.
ARCHER: Twenty metres, maybe twenty five.
TUCKER: They're reinforced with duratanium alloy. They can take a hell
of a beating. What have you got in mind?
ARCHER: I need two shuttlepod hatches. Have them brought up here on the
double.
TUCKER: Sir?
ARCHER: On the double. (Tucker leaves.)
T'POL: Captain, I assume there's no point in my questioning your plan.
 [Situation room]
 T'POL: Bridge to Captain Archer.
 [Hull]
 ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: We're ready.
ARCHER: See you soon.
 [Situation room]
 TUCKER: Hang on, fellas.
(The section of hull plating with Archer, Reed and the mine on it is
set free to float away.)
 (Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Six hundred metres. (Tucker is back in the situation room.)
TUCKER: Another hundred ought to do
it. (Two warbirds decloak.)
TRAVIS: Sub-commander. (T'Pol comes forward to the Captain's chair.)
T'POL: Hail them.
TRAVIS: No response. (He is now at Reed's station.)
TUCKER: They're charging weapons.
T'POL: Polarise the hull plating.
TUCKER: I'll do what I can, but keep in mind we're missing some of it.
 [Hull]
 (Archer starts cutting through the spine pinning
Reed's leg to the hull.)
REED: It's rearming.
ARCHER: That's it, let's go.
(The two men push off from the hull and mine, turning the shuttlepod
hatches towards the source of the expected blast.)
ARCHER: Now, Malcolm!
(The mine explodes, and the blast impacts their metal shields first,
hurling the pair far away.)
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Enterprise to Captain Archer. Captain,
respond. (Silence.)
TUCKER: Maybe their transmitters were knocked out in the blast. Travis?
TRAVIS: I see them. Bearing two one three mark four. Closing in.
T'POL: Open the doors to Launch bay two.
TUCKER: The Romulans are locking weapons.
T'POL: Bridge to Doctor Phlox.
PHLOX [OC]: Go ahead.
T'POL: Meet us outside Launch bay two.
TUCKER: They're targeting our engines.
TRAVIS: A hundred metres more. Fifty. I've got them. Sealing Launch bay
doors.
T'POL: Go to warp, Ensign.
 [Launch bay two]
 (Lying on the closed launch doors, helmets off.)
ARCHER: Are you all right?
REED: All things considered. If I may say so, sir, your style of
command does have its advantages.
ARCHER: So, how long was it?
REED: I counted ten seconds.
ARCHER: Ten? It was more like twenty.
REED: Respectfully, sir, it was ten.
ARCHER: I'm not going to argue with you, Malcolm. It was twenty. That's
an order.
(Tucker, T'Pol and Phlox enter.)

The Enterprise Transcripts - Dead Stop
Dead Stop
 Original Airdate: 9 Oct, 2002

Captain's Starlog, supplemental. It's been almost four days since the
incident in the Romulan minefield. Repair teams have been working
around the clock. Nerves are definitely frayed.
 [Inspection pod]
 (Inspecting the damage to the hull.)
ARCHER: It's incredible we're still in one piece.
TUCKER: If that mine had hit another metre to the left. We can't
polarise the port bow plating until those breaches are sealed.
ARCHER: What's your guess.
TUCKER: Assuming we can find some tritanium alloy? Three or four
months. And with this kind of damage the best I can give you is warp
two, maybe two point one.
ARCHER: In other words, we're a decade away from Jupiter Station. What
about the transceiver array?
TUCKER: The subspace antenna's damaged. All we've got is short-range.
ARCHER: We've answered enough calls for help over the past year. It's
time someone returned the favour.
TUCKER: You serious?
ARCHER: Archer to Ensign Sato.
HOSHI [OC]: Go ahead, sir.
ARCHER: I want you to get started on a general distress call.
Assistance required. Minor repairs. Don't go into too much detail.
HOSHI [OC]: Understood, sir.
ARCHER: Archer out.
 [Sickbay]
 REED: You're killing me! (Phlox is holding Reed's left foot.)
PHLOX: Push, Lieutenant. Two more seconds.
And rest.
REED: It can't be ethical to cause a patient this much pain.
PHLOX: It's unethical to harm a patient. I can inflict as much pain as
I like. A positive attitude is vital to the healing process. The more
you complain, the longer your recovery is likely to take.
REED: When will I be able to return to duty?
PHLOX: Another week, possibly two.
REED: Two weeks?
PHLOX: Attitude, Lieutenant. The wound might heal faster if you'd allow
me to apply a few more Regulan Blood Worms.
REED: You're not putting any more of those things inside my leg. You
still haven't found the last one.
PHLOX: He'll come out on his own, eventually.
 [Ready room]
 (A squeaking noise makes Porthos get up.)
ARCHER: Did you hear that? I don't believe it. Trip told me he fixed
that squeak. (comm. beep) Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: Captain, we're receiving response to the distress call.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: It's a Tellarite freighter.
ARCHER: Put them through. This is Captain Archer of the starship
Enterprise. Thank you for responding.
TELLARITE [OC]: (very crackly, barely audible) How may we be of
assistance?
ARCHER: We need help in repairing some hull damage. If you can
rendezvous with us, we'd be happy to discuss
TELLARITE [OC]: Schedule won't permit it. The signal is
HOSHI: I'm sorry, sir. They're barely within range.
ARCHER: Can you repeat?
TELLARITE [OC]: Transmitting coordinates. Repair station at
ARCHER: Sounded like he said repair station?
T'POL: We have received a set of co-ordinates.
ARCHER: What do you know about these Tellarites?
T'POL: They're not the most agreeable species, but they're usually
trustworthy. The co-ordinates are three and a half days away at warp
two.
ARCHER: I think it's worth a look.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.(They arrive at the repair station.)
ARCHER: This is Captain Archer of the starship Enterprise. We need to
make some repairs. I was told you might be willing to help us. We'd be
grateful for any assistance you could offer. Please respond.
HOSHI: Nothing.
ARCHER: Biosigns?
T'POL: None that I can detect.
HOSHI: Maybe it's abandoned.
TUCKER: We might be able to board it, salvage some of the materials we
need.
ARCHER: It doesn't seem that Enterprise could fit inside those docking
berths. What's it look like inside?
T'POL: I'm detecting a liquid helium atmosphere. The temperature's two
hundred and seventy degrees below zero. (a bright light sweeps the
bridge) A bio-molecular probe.
TRAVIS: Sir.
(One of the two docking bays opens and expands to receive the starship.)
TUCKER: It's reconfiguring to fit the saucer section.
T'POL: The liquid helium's being replaced by a warmer oxygen-nitrogen
atmosphere.
HOSHI: Still no response to our hails.
T'POL: It appears an invitation's been extended.
ARCHER: They need to work a little on their hospitality.
TUCKER: I don't see that we have a lot of options.
ARCHER: Take us in.
(Access tubes extend to meet the docking ports as Enterprise glides to
a halt.)
 [Station]
 (Carefully, Tucker, T'Pol and Archer leave
Enterprise and follow the flashing lights into a pristine white space
station. They are led to a room with a holographic representation of
the ship in the centre of it.)
TUCKER: They've isolated every hull breach, every damaged system. I'll
be damned. We scratched the hull right here, a year ago. I bumped it
with the inspection pod, remember?
ARCHER: I thought I told you to have that repainted.
TUCKER: I was getting around to it. (Archer explores the wall monitors.)
ARCHER: Everything's in English. The ship
wasn't the only thing they probed. I think that's Malcolm. That's where
his left leg was injured.
T'POL: This facility may have the technology to repair Mister Reed as
well.
COMPUTER: (a female voice) The analysis of your vessel is complete.
Select a method of compensation to begin the repair process.
ARCHER: Who am I speaking with?
COMPUTER: Your inquiry was not recognised.
ARCHER: Is there someone here I can speak with?
COMPUTER: Your inquiry was not recognised.
TUCKER: I don't think there's anyone back there.
T'POL: Perhaps the station's automated.
ARCHER: Are you saying you can repair all our systems?
COMPUTER: Select a method of compensation to begin the repair process. (Archer reads a display.)
ARCHER: We can give them either three warp coils,
five deuterium injectors or two hundred litres of warp plasma.
TUCKER: I wouldn't recommend giving up any hardware we can't replace.
ARCHER: Plasma?
TUCKER: I think we can spare it.
ARCHER: If we agree to these terms, how long will the repairs take?
COMPUTER: Time to completion, thirty four point two Earth hours.
TUCKER: I'm telling you, the boys at Jupiter Station would take three
months.
T'POL: It's a fair exchange.
COMPUTER: Select a method of compensation to begin the repair process.
(Archer picks the plasma option.)
COMPUTER: Compensation will be due when the repairs are completed. Your
vessel will then disengage immediately. All personnel are required to
vacate areas that are undergoing reconstruction.
ARCHER: Look at this.
T'POL: It's our repair schedule.
ARCHER: Transmit it to Hoshi and have her inform the crew.
(Giant gantries start to swing around Enterprise.)
TRAVIS [OC]: Enterprise to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Some kind of mechanical arms are being
attached to the outer hull.
 [Station diagnostic room]
 ARCHER: It's all right, Travis. Stand by.
(Another door opens)
COMPUTER: The recreation facility is now available to all personnel.
Enjoy your visit.
 [Recreation area]
 (Another sci-fi white room, with a few tables and
chairs and a great view of Enterprise being welded up.)
TUCKER: If this their idea of a recreation facility you might want to
ask for our plasma back. (T'Pol refers to the centre of a circular table.)
T'POL: A matter energy
converter.
TUCKER: It could be a transporter. An awfully small one.
T'POL: I believe it's a molecular synthesiser of some kind. Similar to
a protein resequencer, but far more advanced. Water, cold. (A glass of
water with a couple of ice cubes materialises, and she sips it.) T'POL: I saw a
similar device on a Tarkalean vessel. It was capable of replicating
almost any inanimate object.
TUCKER: If we had one of these in Engineering we could make all the
spare parts we need. I wonder what else is on the menu. One pan-fried
catfish. (A plate, knife and fork, fish, twist of lemon, greens and two
other items of food appear.) TUCKER: Smells like the real thing. (He tastes it.)
ARCHER: Well?
TUCKER: Not bad.
ARCHER: I doubt there's a catfish within a hundred and thirty light
years.
T'POL: It's genome is stored in Enterprise's computer as is the recipe.
The station evidently scanned our database.
ARCHER: It would have been nice to have been asked. I can only imagine
what else this thing knows about us.
TUCKER: Captain, you've got to try this.
ARCHER: Thanks, but I'll stick with whatever Chef's serving. I'll be on
the Bridge.
 [Sickbay]
 (As the all-purpose gantry arms create
forcefields, weld, replicate bulkheads and generally rebuild the ship,
one is aiming a beam at Reed's leg.)
REED: Are you sure this thing knows what it's doing?
PHLOX: That's the third time you've asked.
REED: You didn't answer me the first two times.
PHLOX: It's remarkable. Your cells are regenerating at an exponential
rate. Do you see how it's using a cytokinetic enzyme to stimulate the
cell division?
REED: Lovely.
PHLOX: (almost drooling) I could certainly use a device like this.
Perhaps the Captain could negotiate a trade of some sort. (The device
finishes and beams itself away. Phlox does a scan.) PHLOX: The tissue is
completely healed. Even the scar is gone. Try standing up. Any pain?
REED: None.
 [Ready room]
(Archer is watching the repairs through the window.)ARCHER: Come in.
T'POL: Repairs are currently underway on C deck. Work on Launch Bay one
is scheduled to begin at twenty two hundred hours.
ARCHER: They even fixed the squeak in the floor. I was starting to
wonder if we had a gremlin under the deck plating. (T'Pol looks
puzzled.) ARCHER: A mythical creature. British pilots used to blame them for
problems they couldn't explain.
T'POL: Perhaps I should scan for one.
ARCHER: That won't be necessary. Is Trip happy with how the repairs are
going?
T'POL: He says they're exceeding Starfleet specifications.
ARCHER: That's good to hear. Anything else?
T'POL: If I may make an observation?
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL: You seemed troubled.
ARCHER: Guess I need to do a better job at repressing my emotions.
These repairs are one hell of a bargain at only two hundred litres of
warp plasma, don't you think?
T'POL: Not every culture is based on the acquisition of wealth. The
station's builders could simply have been interested in helping others.
ARCHER: What happened to them? They could have at least left a message.
Thanks for stopping by.
T'POL: Perhaps they prefer anonymity.
ARCHER: Don't you find that a little suspicious? I know you don't put a
lot of faith in your feelings, but I've learned to trust mine.
Something doesn't smell right.
 [Station recreation area]
 (Most of the crew are there, enjoying a meal and a
glass of wine.)
REED: Honestly, I started to feel a little sorry for the Doctor. There
wasn't anything for him to do but stand there and watch this thing
work.
TUCKER: I know how he must have felt. I saw an entire transtator
assembly replaced in fifteen minutes. It would have taken my crew a
week. With this kind of technology Starfleet could build ships that
maintain themselves. They wouldn't need Chief Engineers. Or Tactical
Officers.
REED: A starship without a Tactical Officer? I can't say I see the
point.
TUCKER: You'd think a computer that can do all this would have to be
pretty big. Our computer's the most advanced in the fleet and it's
three decks high.
REED: I suppose you're right.
TUCKER: So where is it?
REED: I don't follow.
TUCKER: I ran a scan of the station a few hours ago. These are the
docking berths. We're here. This is the diagnostic room.
REED: Well, that compartment's the only place it could be, but it's
barely half the size of this one.
TUCKER: A machine capable of billions of calculations every nanosecond
and it can fit inside the proverbial bread box. I'd love to get a look
at that.
REED: You could always ask.
TUCKER: I tried. Your inquiry was not recognised.
REED: Well, I guess that's that.
TUCKER: Not necessarily. This cooling duct runs all the way to the
center of the station. I saw an access port in one of the corridors.
REED: This computer might not take kindly to people snooping around.
TUCKER: I haven't seen any no trespassing signs. We're explorers.
Where's your spirit of adventure?
REED: I left it in a Romulan minefield.(He sighs and gestures for another
look at the PADD.)
 [Station corridor]
(Tucker is sitting on Reed's shoulders to remove a
grate in the ceiling.)  TUCKER: Almost. Got it.
REED: If the Captain learns about this we'll both be scrubbing plasma
conduits for a month.
(They climb up into the ventilation shaft.)
 [Travis's quarters]
 (The comm. beeps.)
TRAVIS: Mayweather.
ARCHER [OC]: Travis, it's the Captain. Would you mind coming down to
Launch Bay one?
TRAVIS: I thought that section was off-limits, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: Not anymore. I could use a hand, Ensign.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
 [Station ventilation shaft]
 (The two explorers are crawling on hands and
knees.)
REED: Are you sure this is the right direction?
(An alarm goes off, an iris closes off the shaft in front of them, then
they get beamed away to...)
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER: Evening, Sub-Commander.
 [Launch Bay one]
 TRAVIS: Captain? Hello? Hello? (He sees an open
section of the bulkhead with electricity rippling across it.)
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Do you know how stupid that little stunt
was? You could just as easily been transported out into space. You're
senior officers. You're supposed to be setting an example for the rest
of the crew.
TUCKER: It was my idea, sir.
ARCHER: I think Lieutenant Reed is old enough to make his own
decisions. (to Reed) You've made it clear to me that you think
discipline aboard Enterprise has gotten a little too lax. I'm beginning
to agree with you. You're both restricted to quarters until further
notice. Dismissed.
TUCKER: Yes, sir.
REED: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: Hold on. Did you notice anything interesting when you were in
there?
TUCKER: Depends on what you mean by interesting.
T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: You're needed in Launch Bay one immediately.
 [Launch Bay one]
 (Phlox is examining Travis's supine body.)
ARCHER: What happened?
PHLOX: He's dead, Captain.
(A little later, as we watch Travis being wheeled along on a gurney.)
PHLOX: The subcutaneous burns are consistent with an isolytic shock but I
can't be certain until I perform a full postmortem. I'll keep you
apprised.
TUCKER: It looks like he was trying to tap into the EPS grid when this
relay overloaded.
ARCHER: Why the hell would he come down here during his off hours and
start tampering with the power systems?
TUCKER: I don't get it. Travis would have checked with me before doing
any maintenance.
ARCHER: Did you notify the crew that this section was off-limits?
T'POL: Yes.
ARCHER: Well, apparently somebody didn't get the message. What time did
he go off duty?
T'POL: Eighteen hundred hours.
TUCKER: Malcolm and I saw him on the station about a half an hour
later. He was having dinner with Hoshi.
ARCHER: Talk to her. See if he said anything to her about this. And go
over the comm. logs. I want to know if he talked to anyone else.
REED: It might be a good idea to check his quarters as well.
ARCHER: Post a security detail outside every section that's under
repair.
REED: Aye, sir.
 [Station diagnostic room]
 ARCHER: A member of my crew is dead. We don't know
what happened.
COMPUTER: Your inquiry was not recognised.
ARCHER: My helmsman was killed in Launch Bay One. We think it happened
while that section was off-limits.
COMPUTER: All personnel are required to vacate areas that are
undergoing reconstruction.
ARCHER: We're aware of that. You must have some kind of record of what
happened.
COMPUTER: All personnel are required to vacate areas that are
undergoing reconstruction.
ARCHER: I need to talk to a person. Someone who can access your
database and tell me what happened.
COMPUTER: Your inquiry was not recognised.
ARCHER: Who built this station? What species?
COMPUTER: Your inquiry was not recognised.
ARCHER: What species? (He hits the computer screen in frustration.)
COMPUTER: Any damage to these facilities will be charged to your
vessel.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: Computer, begin recording. Subject's name,
Ensign Travis Mayweather. Human male. Weight, seventy two kilograms.
Age, twenty six Earth years. Far too young to be on this table.
Cellular decay suggests that death occurred at approximately twenty
three thirty hours. Preliminary cause of death, ventricular
fibrillation induced by an isolytic shock. The vascular system appears
to have functioned as a conduit for the discharge. The musculature
shows extensive necrosis along the conductive pathway. There are
subcutaneous burns over approximately twelve percent of the body.
(Hoshi enters) The right phalanges and metacarpus exhibit signs of
multiple thermal fractures. Computer, pause. Ensign? This is not an
ideal time.
HOSHI: I wanted to say goodbye.
PHLOX: You may find this disturbing.
HOSHI: I've seen a body before. Fifteen of them on that alien ship.
PHLOX: It's different when it's someone you know personally. (He pulls
back the curtain for her.)
HOSHI: I was hoping it was another one of his practical jokes. Travis
called me down to decon a few weeks ago. He said that he brought some
kind of gelatinous lifeform aboard. He said it might be sentient, that
the Captain needed me to figure out how to communicate with it.
PHLOX: I don't recall that.
HOSHI: There was no lifeform. It was only strawberry gelatine. I told
him I was going to get him back. I'm sorry.
PHLOX: It might comfort you to know he felt very little pain. An
isolytic shock instantly impairs the nervous. That's odd. (He looks at the
monitor.)
HOSHI: What?
PHLOX: They're dead. All of them. Excuse me, Ensign.
 [Travis's quarters]
 ARCHER: Anything?
REED: No. It doesn't look like Travis used the comm. system last night.
Crewman Hayes says she passed him on his way to the launch bay but they
didn't speak. She said he seemed to be in quite a hurry. (There is text on a monitor.)
ARCHER: What's this?
REED: It's a letter to his sister. It was on the monitor when I came
in. I'm afraid there isn't much here. He mentions something about
cancelling breakfast with him.
ARCHER: That was last week. I had to postpone it. Have we been able to
locate his parents?
REED: Sub-Commander T'Pol's working on it, but it could take some time.
Cargo ships aren't always easy to track down.
(comm. beeps)
ARCHER: Archer.
PHLOX [OC]: It's Doctor Phlox, Captain. I need to see you right away.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: Did you find something?
PHLOX: As a matter of fact, I did. This is not Ensign Mayweather.
ARCHER: What?
PHLOX: It's a nearly perfect replica. I've never seen a lifeform
duplicated in such extraordinary detail, from its epidermis down to its
cellular proteins. This is remarkable work.
ARCHER: If it's so perfect, how do you know it's not him?
PHLOX: You recall what happened to Crewman Fisher last month after our
visit to Tessik Prime?
ARCHER: He came down with Rigelian fever.
PHLOX: I inoculated the entire crew to prevent an outbreak. Would you
mind rolling up your sleeve? (Phlox puts a cuff over Archer's wrist and shows
his bloodstream on the monitor.) PHLOX: The vaccine contained millions of
genetically altered microbes. Most of them are still in your
bloodstream. They typically survive for, oh, at least several weeks.
(He does the same for the body.) PHLOX: Every one of the alien microbes in this
body is dead.
ARCHER: Couldn't they have been killed by the isolytic shock?
PHLOX: These microbes thrive on isolytic energy. If anything, they
would have multiplied. I believe that someone, or something, has
abducted Ensign Mayweather and left this facsimile in his place.
ARCHER: Apparently bulkheads aren't the only thing this station can
replicate.
PHLOX: It's ironic, in a way. The station can duplicate a dead human
body in all its exquisite detail, yet a living, simple, one-celled
organism is beyond its capability.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: I've located Ensign Mayweather's parents.
ARCHER: You'd better hold off. Their son may still be alive. You and
Trip managed to get pretty far inside the station. How close do you
think you got to the computer core?
REED: We were within twenty metres when we tripped the sensors.
ARCHER: Think you could find a way to get past them?
REED: I believe so.
T'POL: Our repairs will be complete in nineteen minutes. The station's
expecting us to depart.
ARCHER: Bridge to Engineering.
TUCKER [OC]: Tucker here.
ARCHER: Trip,
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER [OC]: Have you prepared our payment?
TUCKER: The canisters are almost ready, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: Don't be in such a hurry.
 [Station diagnostic room]
 (As the last welding arm withdraws from
Enterprise's hull, Trip pushes a trolley with four plasma canisters
through the doorway.)
TUCKER: Two hundred litres of warp plasma, as promised.
COMPUTER: Please place your compensation on the transport platform.
(Which slides out from the wall.)
TUCKER: Hold on. Hold on. There's a couple of problems we need to
discuss first. Now, I'm not real happy with the quality of some of your
work. Are you listening to me?
COMPUTER: Please place your compensation on the transport platform.
TUCKER: I've looked at the bolt couplings you used to attach the new
hull plating. I'm afraid they're not up to Starfleet specs. And the
subspace amplifier you repaired? We're picking up distortion on all the
high-band frequencies.
COMPUTER: Please place your compensation on the transport platform.
TUCKER: We're not paying until we sort this out.
(Archer pulls T'Pol up into the ventilation shaft.)
TUCKER: What guarantee do I have that these duranium pins won't fly out
the instant we jump to warp?
COMPUTER: Your inquiry was not recognised.
TUCKER: On my world, we have an expression. The customer's always
right. Maybe you should make that part of your programme. I want to
know how someone files a grievance around here.
 [Station ventilation shaft]
 REED: It's there, about five metres ahead. (He crawls
forward to the iris, sets off the alarm and gets beamed out to the
Bridge while Archer and T'Pol take readings. Then they use their phase
pistols.)
 [Station diagnostic room]
 TUCKER: Sounds like you've got more important
things to deal with. (He runs away. T'Pol disables the transporter sequence, then
gets the iris open by firing at it. They make their way out of the
shaft into a more shabby part of the station, where people are draped
over benches hung from the ceiling at various heights, and hooked up to
a what looks like a central unit.)
 [Station data core]
 COMPUTER: Incursion detected in primary data core.
Vacate this section or your vessel will be compromised.
T'POL: I'm detecting one human biosign.
ARCHER: Are they alive?
T'POL: Their vital organs appear to be functioning. They've suffered
severe neurological damage.
COMPUTER: Incursion detected in primary data core. Vacate this section
or your vessel will be compromised.
T'POL: Their synaptic pathways have been reconfigured, integrated into
the computer core.
COMPUTER: Incursion detected in primary data core. Vacate this section
or your vessel will be compromised.
T'POL: Captain.(She's found Travis, suspended high up.)
COMPUTER: Incursion detected in primary data core. Vacate this section
or your vessel will be compromised.
(Archer climbs up and starts pulling tubes out of him.)
 [Bridge]
 REED: Three of the station's arms have just
clamped on to the hull.
TUCKER: Polarise the hull plating.
REED: There's no effect.
TUCKER: Stand by weapons. (Power starts to fluctuate.)
REED: They're going offline.
HOSHI: The station's tapped in to the ship's umbilical ports. It's
overriding our command functions.
TUCKER: Try to lock out the main computer.
HOSHI: I can't. Our access codes have been scrambled.
 [Station data core]
 TRAVIS: Sir?
ARCHER: It's okay, Travis. We're taking you home. (T'Pol is looking for another way out.)
T'POL: Right here.
(They use their phase pistols to blast a hole in a bulkhead, out into a
white corridor and then finally to an Enterprise airlock where Phlox
and a crewman are waiting.)
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge.
PHLOX: The comm.'s down.
(Archer and T'Pol run off.)
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER: Travis?
ARCHER: On his way to Sickbay. What's our status?
TUCKER: It's been better. The station's got us by the thrusters. (sits
at helm)
ARCHER: Impulse engines?
TUCKER: Offline.
REED: We're losing main power.
HOSHI: Life support's failing.
ARCHER: Malcolm, I think it's time we deliver our payment.
(Reed uses a remote control to set off a detonator next to the plasma
containers in the station's diagnostic room. Boom!)
REED: It did some heavy damage, sir. Power levels are dropping, but the
plasma hasn't ignited the O2 conduits yet.
ARCHER: It needs to reach three thousand degrees, Malcolm. Be patient.
REED: Yes, sir.
(A pause, then the ship starts to shake.)
REED: I'm reading secondary explosions throughout the station.
(The station starts to fall apart, and Enterprise's light come back to
full brightness.)
T'POL: Command functions are coming back online.
ARCHER: Engines?
TUCKER: Impulse and thrusters.
REED: One of those arms is still locked onto the hull.
T'POL: If we don't disengage soon, we'll be incinerated.
ARCHER: Full thrusters.
TUCKER: It's no good. And if I fired up the impulse engines we'd
probably tear off half the saucer section.
ARCHER: Can you launch a torpedo?
REED: At this range, sir, I wouldn't recommend it.
ARCHER: I agree, but I don't think we have much choice.
(A torpedo is launched at the securing arm, and smashes through half of
it.)
ARCHER: One more, Lieutenant! (This one impacts properly and explodes.)
ARCHER: Get us out of here.
(Enterprise departs to a backdrop of multiple explosions)
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: You look pretty good for a dead guy.
How're you feeling?
TRAVIS: Much better, sir. Thank you. The doctor told me what happened.
I'm not sure I understand.
ARCHER: We're still trying to figure that out for ourselves.
PHLOX: I may be able to shed some light on the subject. (He hands over a
piece of metal.) PHLOX: It seems to be some kind of interface designed to
convert neural impulses into binary code. Essentially, the station was
using your brain to enhance its processing power.
TRAVIS: Why would it do that?
T'POL: The cerebral cortex is the most sophisticated computer known to
exist.
TRAVIS: What about all those other people?
PHLOX: According to T'Pol's scans most of them had been there for
years. The damage to their brains was irreversible. Fortunately, you
were removed before any permanent injury occurred.
ARCHER: When can I have my helmsman back?
PHLOX: I'd like to observe him for another twenty four hours, if you
don't mind. (Phlox leaves them.)
ARCHER: Captain's mess, Friday morning, oh eight hundred. Don't be
late.
TRAVIS: Sounds good, sir.(In the darkness of space, amongst a load of
debris, a welding arm is at work.)

The Enterprise Transcripts - A Night In Sickbay
A Night
In Sickbay
 Original Airdate: 16 Oct, 2002
 
 [Decon chamber, 8:47 pm]
 (Enterprise is orbiting a planet. Hoshi is putting
gel on T'Pol's back, while T'Pol is smothering Archer's back and he is
treating Porthos.)
ARCHER: Starfleet didn't send us out here to humiliate ourselves. How
long were we in orbit, grovelling? Six days?
HOSHI: Five, sir, and it wasn't exactly grovelling.
ARCHER: Apologising, asking forgiveness, just because we ate lunch in
front of them on our own ship months ago. I call that grovelling.
HOSHI: They were offended.
T'POL: The Kreetassans manufacture plasma injectors. We need one.
ARCHER: So we spend six days grovelling.
HOSHI: Five days.
ARCHER: And when they finally agree to talk to us, we go down. And what
do they do? They keep us waiting for twelve hours and then send us
packing. No explanation, no plasma injector. Just leave, go back to
your ship.
T'POL: We obviously offended them again.
ARCHER: Maybe my hair's parted on the wrong side. I'm exhausted, and
I've had it with these people.
HOSHI: (answering comm.) Go ahead.
PHLOX [OC]: The three of you are clear to go, but I'm afraid I'll need
to keep Porthos for a while.
ARCHER: What's the problem?
PHLOX [OC]: He picked up a pathogen of some kind on the surface.
Neither decon agent has been effective.
ARCHER: What are you going to do?
PHLOX [OC]: I'm not sure yet. I'll let you know as soon as I run some
tests.
HOSHI: (as she and T'Pol leave) Feel better, Porthos.
ARCHER: Doc'll have you good as new before you know it. I might even
break the no-cheese rule tonight. (Archer goes to leave, and Porthos whimpers.)
ARCHER: Sorry, fella. You got to stay.
 [Engineering - 9:09 pm]
 TUCKER: We're playing with fire, Captain. It's
just a matter of time before this injector gives up the ghost.
ARCHER: You've got four more. The ship can run on four.
TUCKER: Yeah, but it can't run on three. You know what happens at warp
speed when you've only got three plasma injectors online.
ARCHER: What are the odds of us losing another one before we find a
replacement?
TUCKER: I'm not comfortable with four, Captain. We need five. What the
hell happened down there, anyway?
ARCHER: T'Pol thinks we insulted them again.
TUCKER: How? You didn't eat cabbage before you left.
ARCHER: I was a perfect gentleman. We're going to have to go somewhere
else to find you your injector, Trip. These people are impossible.
TUCKER: Their components are metallurgically sound, dependable. We
could look for six months and not find anything half as compatible.
You're a trained diplomat. Take the high road. There's got to be some
way you can kiss and make up.
ARCHER: I'll have T'Pol see if she can find out what we did, but I'm
not promising anything.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: I went to decon. I thought you were there
with Porthos. Is every (He sees Porthos looking unhappy in an isolation
box with rubber gloves to prevent direct contact.)
PHLOX: It's all right to pet him. You'll have to use the isolation
gloves.
ARCHER: Did you run your tests?
PHLOX: His auto-immune system is collapsing. I've isolated the
pathogen, broken down its protein sequence. I can't explain it,
Captain. It shouldn't be affecting him like this, but it is.
ARCHER: So what are you doing?
PHLOX: Running more tests. I'm sure I'll come up with something.
ARCHER: How sure? Could this be life-threatening?
PHLOX: It's too early to tell.
ARCHER: Didn't we send his genome to the Kreetassans along with ours?
PHLOX: I transmitted them myself before you left Enterprise.
ARCHER: So shouldn't they have noticed there's a pathogen in their
atmosphere that his immune system can't handle?
PHLOX: They should have, assuming they took the time to check.
ARCHER: I'm told I've offended these people twice. Once for eating in
front of them, the second time, I don't even know what for. But if
their carelessness has hurt Porthos or, God forbid, ends up killing
him, they're going to find out what being offended is all about.
PHLOX: Porthos has no intention of giving up, and neither do I.
ARCHER: You hear that, boy? (He uses a glove to rub Porthos' chest.) ARCHER: We're
all pulling for you.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Did you reach them?
T'POL: Yes.
ARCHER: And?
T'POL: I think we should discuss this in your ready room.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Well?
T'POL: Do you recall the stand of trees outside the Hall of Diplomacy?
ARCHER: What are you talking about?
T'POL: They're Alvera trees, over three hundred years old.
ARCHER: That's fascinating. Did you apologise for whatever we did
wrong? Are we going to get our plasma injector?
T'POL: The Kreetassans consider the Alvera trees cultural treasures.
Apparently, Porthos urinated on one of them.
ARCHER: And that's what they're insulted about?
T'POL: It is understandable.
ARCHER: Well, maybe if they'd bothered to read the genetic profile we
sent they'd have told us to leave the dog on the ship, and then he
wouldn't have had an opportunity to pee on one of their precious trees.
T'POL: I conveyed your sincerest apologies to the Chancellery. They're
discussing possible acts of contrition.
ARCHER: Where the hell do you get off conveying my sincerest apologies?
They're the ones who should be sorry.
T'POL: I don't need to remind you that Commander Tucker is relying on
us.
ARCHER: There are some things more important than plasma injectors.
T'POL: Are you referring to your pride?
ARCHER: I'll tell you one thing, Sub-Commander. If anything happens to
Porthos, I'll be the one watering their Alvera trees. (Archer leaves. In his quarters at 10:32 pm he's bouncing a water polo ball against the wall
a la 'Cooler King' while a game is playing on his monitor. Then he
looks at Porthos's cushion, picks up a blanket and leaves.)
 [Sickbay]
 (Phlox watches Archer walk in with the blanket and pillow.)
PHLOX: If you were a married man I'd be wondering if your wife had
thrown you out.
ARCHER: I just thought it might cheer Porthos up if I slept here
tonight. That is, if it's all right with you.
PHLOX: I don't think your dog is in any condition to know whether
you're here or not.
ARCHER: Well then, maybe it'll cheer me up.
PHLOX: Be my guest. Take your pick. (gestures to biobeds)
ARCHER: How's Porthos doing?
PHLOX: My sub-mammalian database contains no pertinent files on bugles,
but there's sufficient information on similar chordata.
ARCHER: Beagles.
PHLOX: Yes. (Archer makes up his temporary bed.)
ARCHER: Let me ask you a question, Doc,
just out of curiosity. Are there any dogs on your homeworld?
PHLOX: The Denobulan Lemur is highly sought-after. It's not exactly a
dog, but you could say it's doglike. It has a tail, fur. Most have one
head.
ARCHER: Did your medical training include any
PHLOX: Captain, please. You needn't be concerned. I hold six degrees in
Interspecies Veterinary Medicine.
ARCHER: I thought you were just, you know, a people doctor.
PHLOX: As a matter of fact I've also earned degrees in dentistry,
hematology, botanical pharmacology.
ARCHER: I'm impressed. So, how's he doing?
PHLOX: I believe I've eliminated the pathogen. The question is whether
the treatment I've devised will stabilise his auto-immune system before
ARCHER: Before what?
PHLOX: In a few hours, I'll have a more detailed prognosis.
ARCHER: Before what, Doctor?
PHLOX: There are many harmless strains of bacteria that can become
lethal when the immune system is compromised, but it is too early to be
thinking about that. Now, we should both try to get a few hours of
rest. If there are any changes in his vital signs the alarms are quite
loud. Good night. (Archer speaks to a patently fake beagle.)
ARCHER:  I would have brought you some
cheese, but Doctor Phlox wouldn't have let me give you any.
(Archer goes to bed, draws a curtain around it, lies down and dims the lights. A
metallic grinding sound gets him up again.)
ARCHER: Doctor, are you all right?
PHLOX: I'm sorry, Captain. Did I wake you? Just trimming my toenails.
They grow quite rapidly. Have to keep them groomed at least once a
week.
ARCHER: Just wanted to be sure you're okay.
PHLOX: Thanks for your concern. Good night. (He carries on slicing about
an inch of brown nail off his toes. Archer returns to his bed and Phlox
feeds his nail trimmings to something in a cage. Then we're treated to
the sight of Phlox scraping an extremely long tongue. Later, Archer
wakes from sleep to the sound of animals chirping. He gets up to see
Phlox doing a feeding round.)
PHLOX: I'm sorry, Captain. Did I wake you again?
ARCHER: What the hell's going on?
PHLOX: Feeding time. (He sprinkles something into a tank of water and a
mass of bubbles arises.) PHLOX: Don't be greedy.
ARCHER: How long was I asleep?
PHLOX: Nearly an hour.
ARCHER: Does this go on every night?
PHLOX: Only when I'm here. They're very demanding when they know I'm in
Sickbay.
ARCHER: Great. Porthos?
PHLOX: I'll still need at least a couple of hours.
ARCHER: Is he comfortable?
PHLOX: He's fast asleep.
ARCHER: I'm glad to see someone is. I'll check back in a couple of
hours. (Archer leaves.)
 [Gymnasium - 12:09 am]
(T'Pol is running on a treadmill, no sweat, no heavy
breathing.)  T'POL: How's your dog? (Archer starts on another treadmill.)
ARCHER: Nice of you to ask. We'll know
in a couple of hours. (She speeds up her machine, he does the same.)
ARCHER: Have you heard from your friends on the surface?
T'POL: Not yet.
ARCHER: I guess they haven't finished compiling their list of
punishments.
T'POL: They're not interested in punishing you. They only want an
appropriate apology.
ARCHER: I'm sorry.
T'POL: For what?
ARCHER: Just practicing. (T'Pol speeds up her machine again, so he does the same.)
T'POL: You
shouldn't have brought your dog on a diplomatic mission, especially
considering we had previously offended the Kreetassans.
ARCHER: They knew we were bringing him. We even sent his genetic specs.
(He is getting breathless.) ARCHER: They could have asked us to leave him behind. They
didn't. Porthos has the right to a little fresh air.
T'POL: You're once again ignoring the consequences of your actions.
ARCHER: What's that supposed to mean?
T'POL: You obviously place more importance on the quality of the air
your pet breathes than on the quality of the plasma that drives your
ship. (She speeds up her machine again.)
ARCHER: What the hell does one have to do with the other? Isn't it
logical I could care about my ship and my dog? (He speeds up his
treadmill.)
T'POL: I'm not questioning your pluralities. I'm questioning your
priorities.
ARCHER: (sweating and panting) I really thought you were beginning to
understand something about human feelings.
T'POL: Not when it pertains to primitive quadrupeds who haven't
developed the ability to speak or to use a toilet. (She stops her treadmill
and gets off.)
ARCHER: What's the matter?
T'POL: I obviously can't keep up with you. (comm. beeps) T'Pol. (Archer
stops his machine and mops his brow.)
HOSHI [OC]: We've just received a transmission from the Kreetassans.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: It's their reconciliation demands. The
Captain's not going to believe this.
ARCHER [OC]: You'd be surprised, Hoshi.
HOSHI: Captain, I didn't.
ARCHER [OC]: It's all right, Ensign.
 [Gymnasium]
 ARCHER: We're on our way.
 [Bridge]
 (Hoshi hands over a PADD as he gets out of the
turbolift. T'Pol is still cool and collected.)
ARCHER: Well, this isn't so bad. I was sure there'd be something in
here about standing on one foot with my eyes shut, reciting The Night
Before Christmas. I'm going back to Sickbay to see if I can get an
hour's sleep before the Doctor's results come through. Let me know if
this fits with your definition of an appropriate apology. (he leaves.)
HOSHI: Do we have a chainsaw on board?
 [Sickbay - 1:32 am]
 (An alarm goes off.)
ARCHER: What's happening?
PHLOX: He's gone into anaphylactic shock. His body's rejecting the
treatment I selected.
ARCHER: You said we'd know in a few hours if this would work.
PHLOX: Exactly. It's not working.
ARCHER: Is he going to die? (Phlox hands Archer a hypospray.)
PHLOX: Fill this with five cc's of tetrasol.
It's the blue fluid, second on the right. Five cc's.
ARCHER: Five cc's. (Phlox gives the injection then checks the readouts.)
PHLOX: I don't think so.
ARCHER: What?
PHLOX: You asked me if he was going to die.
ARCHER: Are you trying a different treatment? Let me guess. We'll know
in.
PHLOX: A couple of hours, yes. How are things progressing with the
Kreetassans?
ARCHER: They've got a perfectly good plasma injector sitting on a shelf
somewhere. But will they share it with us? Not until I make a fool of
myself by going through some series of ritual apologies. The fact that
Porthos is on death's doorstep doesn't seem to bother any of them.
They're the ones who should be apologising, not me. T'Pol thinks I care
more about my dog than my ship. Isn't that delightful.
PHLOX: Why does T'Pol's opinion concern you?
ARCHER: She's my Science Officer, my second-in-command. She should know
more than anyone aboard how dedicated I am to this mission. To every
member of my crew.
PHLOX: You didn't answer my question.
ARCHER: Porthos has one paw in Beagle heaven because these jerks didn't
bother to look at his genetic profile. Am I supposed to ignore that?
PHLOX: I would think you'd be more interested in Commander Tucker's
opinion. You've known him for many years, if I'm not mistaken.
ARCHER: It would be nice to have all five plasma injectors working but
it's not essential. We can do fine with four, and the fifth one just
started to act up. We might get another ten light years out of it.
PHLOX: Have you considered that your anger may encompass more than just
Porthos and the Kreetassans?
ARCHER: What?
PHLOX: How long has it been since you were intimate with a woman?
ARCHER: What!
PHLOX: How long has it been.
ARCHER: I heard you! I suppose you're going to tell me you have a
degree in psychiatry, too.
PHLOX: Absolutely.
ARCHER: No way. Not a chance. Porthos is the only patient you're
treating right now. You got that? Let me know if there's any change.
(He goes back to the biobed, draws curtain and tries to sleep.)
 [Deleted scene- Sickbay]
 ARCHER: Archer to Commander Tucker.
Captain Archer
 [Tucker's quarters]ARCHER [OC]: to Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: (crawls out of bed) Something wrong, Captain?
ARCHER [OC]: Sorry to wake you, Trip, but I need to see you in Sickbay.
TUCKER: Give me a minute.
 [Sickbay]
 TUCKER: Captain wants to see me.
PHLOX: He's in there.
TUCKER: Sir?
ARCHER: Come on in. (Tucker comes through the curtain.)
TUCKER: What happened, sir? You look terrible.
ARCHER: I'm fine. It's Porthos who's not doing so well.
TUCKER: I'm sorry to hear it, sir. Is there something I could do?
ARCHER: How long has it been since you've been intimate with a woman?
TUCKER: Excuse me?
ARCHER: Forget it. I'm sorry I woke you up, Trip. I just need some more
information on that faulty injector. If we take it offline, try to
repair it, what kind of stress will that put on the other four?
TUCKER: It's a matter of time. The longer we have to rely on four
injectors, the greater the stress. Problem is, I have no idea how long
it would take to repair the one that's malfunctioning.
ARCHER: And if the stress gets too high?
TUCKER: Probably be down to three.
ARCHER: And?
TUCKER: Well, with three injectors, we'd be lucky to reach warp speed.
ARCHER: Go get some sleep.
TUCKER: I had a grade school teacher who was certain I stole a pencil
off her desk. I think it was a pencil. She wasn't going to let me go on
the field trip to Pensacola unless I apologised. My mother told me I
should tell her I was sorry, but I said I didn't steal the damn pencil.
You know what she told me? It's okay to apologise when you shouldn't
have to, just as long as you don't mean it. (He leaves Archer to try and
sleep again)
 [Bridge]
 KREETASSAN [on viewscreen]: Why haven't you
adjusted your time to our capital city?
HOSHI: I apologise. We weren't aware that it was required.
KREETASSAN [on viewscreen]: It isn't a requirement. It is simply a
courtesy. Something your species doesn't seem to understand.
HOSHI: I'll explain it to the Captain immediately.
KREETASSAN [on viewscreen]: You might also explain to your Captain that
it's been nearly three hours since he received our transmission. If he
has the slightest hope of acquiring any technology from us, he'd be
wise to pay us the courtesy of responding.
HOSHI: I understand. I'll (The viewscreen reverts to the planet image.) HOSHI: I'll let
him know.
 [Sickbay]
 (Archer is woken by Phlox talking in an alien
language, footsteps running around and chirps. He opens the curtain to
discover the doctor is chasing a bat with a butterfly net.)
PHLOX: Keep your head down! No matter what I do to secure her cage she
always finds a way to get out.
(So Archer joins in the hunt, holding the net while the bat is lured to
a pile of food, and Phlox has an origami bird on a stick which he uses
to try and scare it. However, the bat simply attacks the bird and flies
off again.)
ARCHER: I thought you said your bat was supposed to be terrified of
that thing.
PHLOX: It should have been. Pyrithian Moon Hawks eat these bats. I know
I got the silhouette right, and I mastered the call years ago.
ARCHER: That stuff isn't poisonous, is it? (Some liquid got spilt onto
Phlox in the melee. Phlox tastes it to be sure,)
PHLOX: No, I'll be fine.
ARCHER: What now?
PHLOX: We need to find her before we can catch her. She'll stay up
high. Have you thought any more about why T'Pol's opinion is so
important to you?
ARCHER: It's two thirty in the morning and I'm hunting an escaped bat.
That's all I'm thinking about right now, Doctor. That and Porthos.
PHLOX: Sexual tension, Captain. There's no doubt in my mind.
ARCHER: By the air duct. Do you see it?
PHLOX: That's just the filter bracket. For the past few months I've
noticed increasing friction between you and the Sub-Commander. You must
understand that I'm trained to observe these things.
ARCHER: With all do respect to your training, you're wrong. T'Pol and I
have been getting along just fine, so let it alone.
PHLOX: When one person believes their sexual attraction toward another
is inappropriate they often exhibit unexpected behaviour. Such as
inordinate anger toward comparisons made between their ship and their
beagle.
ARCHER: Listen, Doc, there's no sexual attraction. (The bat takes to
the air again.)
PHLOX: She's coming back down! Watch out!
(Hoshi enters and gently plucks the bat out of the air.)
ARCHER: Don't let her in the corridor!
HOSHI: Hey, are you all right? What are they trying to do to you?
(Phlox takes the bat and puts her back in her container.) HOSHI: The
Kreetassans called, sir.
ARCHER: What for?
HOSHI: They're anxious to get your response to their last transmission.
ARCHER: It's the middle of the night.
HOSHI: They also suggested that we should synchronise our time to their
capital city.
ARCHER: Did they?
HOSHI: It's not a requirement, sir, just a courtesy.
ARCHER: Thank you, Ensign.
HOSHI: How's Porthos?
ARCHER: I'll let you know in a couple of hours. (Hoshi leaves.)
ARCHER: Everything okay?
PHLOX: Nothing new. I'll stay with him.
ARCHER: Thanks.
PHLOX: Unless you'd like to continue our discussion regarding
Sub-Commander T'Pol.
 [Pet Graveyard, pouring with rain]
 (The senior staff are in dark suits under
umbrellas.)
PHLOX: (in clerical collar) We are gathered here today to bid a final
farewell to a faithful and kind colleague. A friend who would never
hesitate to offer his paw in exchange for a simple smile or a slice of
cheese. Like his namesake, this quadruped believed we should stand
together. 'All for one and one for all'. (T'Pol moves close to Archer
and gazes into his eyes, then holds his hand.) PHLOX: When one person believes their sexual attraction toward another is
inappropriate they often exhibit unexpected behaviour.
 [Decon]
 (Situation as in the first scene.)
HOSHI: Go ahead.
PHLOX [OC]: Hoshi, you and the dog are clear to go, but I'm afraid I'll
need to keep the other two for a while.
ARCHER: What's the problem?
PHLOX [OC]: You both picked up a pathogen on the surface. We'll have to
try another decon agent. (He picks up Porthos and leaves.)
HOSHI: Feel better.
(T'Pol isn't wearing a top when they face each other to massage decon
gel into each others shoulders.)
PHLOX [OC]: Tell me, Captain, have you thought any more about why
T'Pol's opinion is so important to you? How long has it been since you
were intimate with a woman? (They kiss.)
 [Sickbay - 2:49 am]
 ARCHER: I dreamt Porthos died.
PHLOX: Let's hope your dream wasn't prophetic.
ARCHER: Any indication on how your second treatment's doing?
PHLOX: It doesn't appear to be doing very well.
ARCHER: An old girlfriend's mother had this Beagle I was crazy about.
Even after her daughter and I broke up, we stayed in touch. When the
dog got pregnant, I was the first one she called. Four males in the
litter. The four musketeers. I've had Porthos since he was six weeks
old. I grew up with dogs. Can't remember not having one. You have any
pets when you were a kid?
PHLOX: My people don't keep pets.
ARCHER: I thought you said something about the Denobulan Lemur being
highly sought after.
PHLOX: Oh, very much so. Their kidneys are considered a great delicacy.
(T'Pol enters with a tray and two covered plates.)
T'POL: I thought you might be hungry.
PHLOX: How very kind.
ARCHER: Was there something on their list about apologising on a full
stomach?
T'POL: You read the Kreetassan's document?
ARCHER: Sorry. Sorry, I'm a little on edge. I haven't slept very much
but I'm doing the breast I, the best I can.
T'POL: I understand. Ensign Sato and I have broken down the
reconciliation demands into specific categories, if you're interested
in reviewing them.
ARCHER: My only concern right now is Porthos.
T'POL: I'm sorry to have interrupted.
ARCHER: No. No, it, it's okay. When you get back to the Bridge, why
don't you send me your lips. Lisp. List.
(T'Pol gives him a long look and then leaves)
PHLOX: Two Pillarian slips within thirty seconds. Interesting.
(the alarm goes off on Porthos's monitor)
ARCHER: What are you doing?
PHLOX: My treatment was effective, at least partially. His immune
system is stabilising but his pituitary gland was severely damaged.
It's all but disintegrated. Bring me the small grey cage on the second
shelf. The one with the blue top.
ARCHER: What's in here? (Phlox is wheeling in a large transparent tank.)
PHLOX: A Calrissian Chameleon.
Fill this for me. (He hands a shower head to Archer.) PHLOX: I'll need to alter its
DNA to avoid rejection but its pituitary gland should be compatible
with your dog's.
ARCHER: You're going to perform a transplant from a lizard?
PHLOX: Unless you have a better suggestion. It's a shame, actually. The
chameleon secretes a rare toxin that's very useful in treating
respiratory infections. She's the last one I have.
ARCHER: What's the tank for?
PHLOX: I'll need to super-hydrate the canine in order to minimize the
shock to his pulmonary system.
ARCHER: You're going to drown my dog?
PHLOX: Only for an hour, Captain. There should be no problem
resuscitating him once the surgery's complete.
ARCHER: How many times have you done this before?
PHLOX: Never.
ARCHER: Has anyone done this before?
PHLOX: Not to my knowledge.
ARCHER: You know, this isn't some guinea pig you're working on here.
This is Porthos, my Beagle, my pal. From what you're telling me the
closest thing your people have to pets are furry little things that go
well with onions.
PHLOX: Perhaps you're right, Captain. Perhaps I'm insensitive to the
bond between you and your subservient quadruped. I'll leave the
procedure up to you. But whatever your decision, make it quickly.
(3:44 am, they are both wearing operating gowns. The chameleon is on a
platter and Porthos is in the tank.)
ARCHER: Just for the sake of argument let's say that some of my anger
toward T'Pol had a component of sexual tension to it. I'm not saying it
does but just for the sake of argument. (Phlox is transplanting the pituitary into Porthos's brain.)
PHLOX: Yes?
ARCHER: What do you mean, yes? You're the psychiatrist. What am I
supposed to do about it? Am I supposed I to ignore it? Am I supposed to
say something to her?
PHLOX: Neither.
ARCHER: Neither?
PHLOX: If you were ignoring it, you obviously wouldn't be seeking my
opinion especially under these circumstances. As for discussing it with
the Sub-Commander that's entirely up to you, but I can't imagine an
outcome that would do anything but make matters worse. Pass me the
auto-suture, please. The yellow one.
ARCHER: When will we know if the transplant's working?
PHLOX: One step at a time. First we need to resuscitate him.
ARCHER: So I can't ignore it, and I can't talk about it. What do you
suggest I do?
PHLOX: Be aware of it, Captain. Simply be aware of it. You'd be
surprised what a difference that'll make. Lower the fluidic temperature
twelve degrees.
ARCHER: If Porthos pulls through, will he need a special diet or
treatments having a chameleon's pituitary gland?
PHLOX: You may have trouble finding him. He'll have the ability to
blend into his background when frightened.
ARCHER: You're kidding.
PHLOX: Yes, I am.
ARCHER: Does your expertise on sexual tension come from professional
training or firsthand experience?
PHLOX: I do have three wives.
ARCHER: And they each have
PHLOX: Two husbands, besides myself.
ARCHER: Sounds very complicated.
PHLOX: Very. Why else be polygamous?
ARCHER: So, these three wives.
PHLOX: Each have three husbands. A total of seven hundred and twenty
relationships, forty two of which have romantic possibilities.
ARCHER: You told me you had five children. How many are there in this
whole extended family?
PHLOX: Thirty one, at last count.
ARCHER: You must miss them. You've been away for over two years.
PHLOX: I'm ready for the synaptic inductor, the small blue one. My
children all left the nest years ago, Captain.
ARCHER: I would have never guessed. You don't look that old.
PHLOX: I'll take that as a compliment. My two daughters, I'm proud to
say, followed in my footsteps. One's a surgeon, the other's a
biochemist.
ARCHER: How about the other three?
PHLOX: My eldest son's an artist. A potter, actually. He lives in the
same town as his mother. Creates beautiful things.
ARCHER: And the other two?
PHLOX: My two younger sons and I never saw eye-to-eye. I'm afraid we
haven't spoken in quite some time.
ARCHER: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.
PHLOX: Perfectly all right. You asked me if I missed them. The answer
is yes, every one of them. The children, the wives, even the other
husbands. But we Denobulans live a long time, Captain, and right now
there is nowhere I'd rather be than serving with the Interspecies
Medical Exchange aboard this wonderful vessel of yours.
ARCHER: Listen, Doc, however this turns out I want to apologise for
accusing you of being insensitive before.
PHLOX: As I recall, you accused my entire species of being insensitive.
Then I apologise to you and all your fellow Denobulans.
PHLOX: Well, I can't speak for the others, but, on behalf of myself, I
accept. And to think T'Pol told me you were incapable of apologising.
 [Deleted scene - Bridge - 4:26
am]
 ARCHER: I didn't think your shift began
until oh nine hundred.
T'POL: I took the liberty of temporarily synchronising our clocks to
the Kreetassan's capital city.
ARCHER: Just a courtesy? (to Hoshi) Ensign, will you join me?
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Have a seat. You've read the
list?
HOSHI: Yes, sir. Sub-commander T'Pol and I broke it down and
ARCHER: She told me. The last part, just before the end, that little
expression that gets repeated. Do you know what I'm talking about?
HOSHI: It's a couplet from one of their oldest political documents.
ARCHER: Their pronunciation guide doesn't make any sense. I'm going to
need some help. 
 [Kreetassan Capital City]
 (Archer is stripped to the waist with braids in his
hair and alien symbols either side of his spine. He is taking a chain saw to a
tree trunk while speaking alien. Then he picks up the slice of trunk
and holds it out while declaiming something before placing it carefully
on the ground with others. The Kreetassans don't look happy, so he
checks his PADD and repeats the lines and gestures again, getting it
exactly right this time. Now they sort of smile and nod.)
 [Ready room - 9:15 am]
 (Archer is eating breakfast)
ARCHER: Come in. Sub-Commander.
T'POL: Mister Tucker reports that the new plasma injector is operating
well within Starfleet parameters. ARCHER: Did he tell you they gave us
two spares out of the kindness of their hearts?
T'POL: Evidently the finesse you exhibited outside the Hall of
Diplomacy was appreciated.
ARCHER: Since I've been getting so much practice giving apologies I
thought I might give you one.
T'POL: That's not necessary.
ARCHER: Yeah, it is. I've been under a lot of stress lately, haven't
gotten much sleep. My dog
T'POL: There's no need to apologise.
ARCHER: Whatever friction there's been between us, I'd like to try to
minimise it.
T'POL: Friction is to be expected whenever people work in close
quarters for extended periods of time.
ARCHER: I guess that's always been true. Especially when the people are
of the opposite sex.
T'POL: Then it's good that you're my superior officer. That we're not
in a position to allow ourselves to become attracted to one another,
hypothetically. If we were, the friction that you speak of could be
much more problematic. 
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: No apologies, Captain.
ARCHER: I promise.
PHLOX: I hear things went very well on the surface.
ARCHER: I doubt I would have even gone down, there if it hadn't been
for you, Doc. I owe you one.
PHLOX: You'll be pleased to know that while you were gone, things went
very well up here, too.
ARCHER: The transplant?
PHLOX: Not the slightest sign of rejection.
ARCHER: Can I see him?
PHLOX: By all means.
ARCHER: Hey. (Porthos is now lying on his side.) ARCHER: It's been one hell of a
night, hasn't it? How soon can he leave?
PHLOX: Now's as good a time as any.
ARCHER: But he's
PHLOX: Unconscious? Nonsense. He's just asleep. (Phlox taps the side of the box, and
Porthos sits up.) PHLOX: Porthos. (Archer opens up the box and catches Porthos as he jumps out.)
ARCHER: Come on, boy.
Yeah. We're going home. Sickbay's all yours. (Phlox gives a very scary CGI Denobulan grin.)
PHLOX: You're welcome back
anytime, Captain.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Marauders
Marauders
 Original Airdate: 30 Oct, 2002
  (A
rocky, scrubby terrain with a bit of a settlement and some machinery
around. A young boy runs to bring water to a couple of workers on a
rig, when they see a small craft flying towards them.)
MAKLII: (orange headband) Is it them?
TESSIC: (red haired man) I don't know. No. It's not their ship. It's
someone else.
(as it comes in to land, we see that it is a shuttlepod. Pod 1 to be
exact, and once it is down safely, Archer, T'Pol and Tucker climb out,
wearing desert fatigues, to be met by the two men)
ARCHER: My name is Captain Archer from the starship Enterprise. We
tried to hail you, but there was no response.
TESSIC: Our communications are down.
ARCHER: That must make it difficult to do business. A Kreetassan
merchant told us this was a deuterium facility.
TESSIC: He was correct.
TUCKER: Our ship took some damage a few weeks ago. We lost most of our
reserves.
TESSIC: I'm sorry, but we can't help you. Two of our pumps are offline.
You'll have to return later in the season.
ARCHER: Our supply will be gone in less than two weeks.
TESSIC: There's nothing we can do.
T'POL: Are you certain? You seem to have a large inventory. Our sensors
showed over eighty thousand litres.
TESSIC: You scanned our tanks?
ARCHER: I apologise, but when you didn't respond to our hails. You sure
you couldn't spare a few hundred litres?
TESSIC: We're holding that for someone else. Come back at the end of
the season. I'm sure we'll be able to accommodate you. (Tessic starts to walk
away.)
MAKLII: Do you have any experience repairing extraction pumps?
TUCKER: Not specifically, but I could grab some tools and take a look.
MAKLII: (to Tessic) We get those pumps operating, we can make our
quota.
ARCHER: It seems that there might be an opportunity for us to help each
other.
TESSIC: Follow me. (Archer and T'Pol do. Tucker returns to the pod for
his tools.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 (Tucker hears someone making gun noises. It's the boy,
who is startled when Trip activates an alarm.)
TUCKER: What are you doing in my chair?
Q'ELL: I didn't touch anything. I just like to look inside the ships
that come here.
TUCKER: You should have asked.
Q'ELL: You might have said no.
TUCKER: Well, what do you think?
Q'ELL: Well, it's a little small and your thruster controls are hard to
reach.
TUCKER: Maybe you need longer arms.
Q'ELL: How fast can it go?
TUCKER: She's designed for one quarter impulse, but, I've been able to
squeeze a little more out of her.
Q'ELL: You're a pilot?
TUCKER: Engineer. Commander Trip Tucker.
Q'ELL: Q'ell.
TUCKER: Nice to meet you.
Q'ELL: Could you teach me how to fly it? I can drive the crawler that
we use to move our drill rigs.
TUCKER: Tell you what. I'll be heading back up to the ship later. You
can come along, if it's all right with your folks. I'll give you a
tour.
Q'ELL: Really?
 [Settlement]
 (In a tent, Tessic, Maklii - sans headband - and a
woman are bartering with Archer and T'Pol.)
TESSIC: Two power cells. We need six.
ARCHER: We can't spare that many. Maybe three.
TESSIC: Do you have any idea how much labour it takes to refine a litre
of deuterium?
ARCHER: Actually, no. I'd enjoy seeing how your facility works.
TESSIC: We have three months of good weather, Captain. Three months to
pump all the deuterium we can before the winter. We don't have time to
give tours. Five power cells for two hundred litres. I can't do any
better.
E'LIS: Our medical stores are running low.
ARCHER: Four power cells and whatever medical supplies we can spare.
TESSIC: All right. But only if you can repair our pumps.
ARCHER: Commander Tucker and his team will do the best they can.
TESSIC: I expect you to leave orbit in two days. If the pumps are
working, you'll leave with the deuterium. If not, you'll leave without
it. Are we agreed?
ARCHER: Agreed.
 [Sickbay]
 (The woman is gazing at a four-legged starfish in
a tank.)
PHLOX: It's yours, if you'd like it.
E'LIS: I wouldn't know what to feed it.
PHLOX: Her needs are modest. A nutrient broth every three or four days.
Less often when she's working.
E'LIS: Working?
PHLOX: She'll ingest a little blood while she's healing an injured
artery.
E'LIS: Thank you, but I'll just take some vascular adhesive.
PHLOX: Try this, instead. (He hands over a gun-like contraption.)
E'LIS: An auto-suture.
PHLOX: I'm surprised you don't have one.
E'LIS: This is a very expensive piece of equipment. I can't.
PHLOX: Nonsense. Please. Cardio-stimulator, neural shock kit. I had no
idea processing deuterium was such a dangerous business.
E'LIS: It can be.
PHLOX: I've only heard of hexatriol being used to treat serious plasma
burns.
E'LIS: Deuterium can burn almost as hot as plasma when it's ignited.
PHLOX: I hope you won't need it. Is there something wrong?
E'LIS: No. I'd better get back.
PHLOX: Of course.
E'LIS: Thank you again. (She leaves carrying two cases of medical supplies.)
 [Settlement]
 (Walking among the structures in the blazing sun.)
ARCHER: You've been to other colonies that trade deuterium, haven't
you?
T'POL: Several.
ARCHER: Are they all this rustic?
T'POL: Not usually.
ARCHER: Their equipment's falling apart. Half these structures look
like they're about to collapse. Phlox tells me they don't even have
basic medical supplies. Deuterium is a highly valuable commodity. You'd
think these people would be better off.
T'POL: We're here to trade with them, not judge their living
conditions.
ARCHER: Then why do they need us to finish fixing their pumps in two
days? What's the hurry?
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Lieutenant, a ship just dropped out of
warp. Six hundred thousand kilometres and closing.
REED: I see her.
HOSHI: It's probably more deuterium customers.
TRAVIS: I'm reading twelve biosigns, all Klingon.
 [Settlement]
 TUCKER: (to Maklii) You'll want to keep an eye on
those phase inverters. They tend to depolarise.
MAKLII: (answering comm.) Pump Six.
TESSIC [OC]: Korok's ship is entering orbit.
MAKLII: I thought we had three more days.
TESSIC [OC]: Secure the pumps. Get everyone inside.
TUCKER: Some kind of trouble?
MAKLII: Help me close these induction valves.
TUCKER: What's going on? Who's Korok?
 [Inside a module]
 T'POL: They must realise that you trade with other
ships.
TESSIC: They believe that we have an exclusive arrangement.
E'LIS: If they think anyone's been here before them, they get very
angry.
TESSIC: (to Archer) Please, don't get involved. We'll talk to them.
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise.
REED [OC]: Go ahead, Captain.
ARCHER: Have the Klingons detected Enterprise yet?
 [Bridge]
 REED: No indication, sir.
 [Inside a module]
 (Maklii and Tucker enter.)
ARCHER: Travis, adjust your orbit.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: Keep Enterprise out of sight.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
 [Settlement]
 (Six Klingons beam down from a tatty looking
vessel.)
KOROK: My old friend.
TESSIC: We weren't expecting you so soon. We've had trouble with two of
our pumps.
KOROK: My crew's hungry. Let's have food and drink. Then we'll discuss
business.
TESSIC: Your deuterium. We don't have all of it. We did our best but we
need more time.
 [Inside a module]
 TUCKER: Can you make out what they're saying?
T'POL: Tessic is explaining that their yield isn't what they'd hoped.
TUCKER: Good ears.
 [Settlement]
 TESSIC: Without those pumps we couldn't operate at
full capacity.
KOROK: I sense what you're about to say is not going to make me happy.
TESSIC: We can give you eighty thousand litres. If you'll give us one
more week, we'll have the rest.
KOROK: You've had enough time. We'll take all of it, now.
TESSIC: We don't have it. I told you, two pumps were down.
KOROK: They all appear to be working.
TESSIC: We were just able to repair them.
KOROK: You're lying! (He knocks Tessic down.)
MAKLII: Leave him alone. You'll get your deuterium. (He gets hit too.
Archer restrains Tucker from going outside.)
TESSIC: Wait, please.
KOROK: I can get deuterium anywhere. I come here because I like you,
when you show me hospitality and respect.
MAKLII: You take everything we own, and you want us to respect you.
KOROK: I'll give you four days. Have it all ready. (into communicator)
HIjol! (The Klingons are beamed away and the rest run out to help.)
E'LIS: Let's get him inside.
 [Inside a module]
 (Q'ell has got the medical kit all ready.)
ARCHER: So this is your exclusive arrangement?
TESSIC: It's not your concern. (E'Lis starts tending Maklii's injury.)
TUCKER: How long have these bullies been pushing you around?
MAKLII: Five seasons. They take all the first yield deuterium we can
extract.
E'LIS: Hold still.
MAKLII: After they leave, we manage to pull a few thousand litres out
of the deep strata, but it takes weeks and it's so full of impurities
we can barely refine it.
TESSIC: It still brings in a decent price. We make enough to get
through the winter.
MAKLII: Barely.
T'POL: Have you tried contacting your homeworld?
TESSIC: It's too far away.
TUCKER: You must have weapons. some way to defend yourselves. How many
of them are there?
E'LIS: Usually seven.
TUCKER: Seven? You've got them outnumbered nine or ten to one.
TESSIC: You've never seen a Klingon in battle, have you? We tried to
stand up to them once, three seasons ago. Five of us died fighting
them. Then they killed three more to prove their point.
E'LIS: (holding Q'ell) One of them was his father.
ARCHER: Maybe there's something we can do.
TESSIC: Just take your two hundred litres and go. If you're here when
they come back, they'll kill you.
 [Settlement]
 ARCHER: Mister Reed.
REED [OC]: The Klingon ship's gone to warp, sir. I'm sending a
shuttlepod down.
ARCHER: We'll be at the landing site. (Tucker sees Q'ell looking wistfully after him.)
TUCKER: I'll catch up with you
later, Captain. Sorry I never got to give you that tour.
Q'ELL: I once saw a Kellenite ship with cannons and torpedoes.
TUCKER: Most big ships carry weapons.
Q'ELL: Like Enterprise.
TUCKER: Yeah, like Enterprise.
Q'ELL: You could have fought the Klingons. Beaten them.
TUCKER: Maybe.
Q'ELL: Why didn't you try?
TUCKER: It's not that simple.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in.
T'POL: The deuterium's been stowed. Two hundred litres. Should I
instruct Ensign Mayweather to break orbit?
ARCHER: So that's it? We just take our deuterium and leave? They work
their asses off to provide for their families and then the Klingons
just stroll in and rob them blind. Does that seem right to you? Malcolm
tells me that Klingon ship isn't much more than a freighter. I'd lay
odds they're no match for Enterprise.
T'POL: And if they withdraw? What will keep them from coming back after
we've gone?
ARCHER: We could try to contact the Klingon High Council. We saved
Klaang from the Suliban, we pulled one of their battle cruisers out of
a gas giant. I say they owe us a favour.
T'POL: I doubt these marauders answer to the High Council.
ARCHER: I already know where Vulcans stand on interfering with other
cultures but this isn't a culture. Seventy six settlers are being
preyed upon. If this were an Earth colony I'd be grateful if someone
showed up to give me a hand.
T'POL: Captain, this may surprise you, but I agree. However, short of
killing the Klingons any action we take will only make the situation
worse.
ARCHER: I just hate the idea of turning our backs.
 [Settlement]
 (It's nighttime, and Tessic is working on a
machine.)
ARCHER: Need a hand?
TESSIC: Control arm is jammed. I could use some help with the release
valve.
ARCHER: Okay.
TESSIC: Turn it to the left.
ARCHER: This one?
TESSIC: Thought you'd be off charting your next start system by now.
ARCHER: Sometimes I have a bad habit of overstaying my welcome.
TESSIC: You obviously didn't come down here in the middle of the night
to help me with this crawler.
ARCHER: Seems to me this crawler's the least of your problems.
TESSIC: We've been through this before. It's not your concern. Give it
another turn.
ARCHER: You said they've been coming here for what, five seasons? How
much longer do you plan on letting this go on? Another five?
TESSIC: That's good. Leave it there. Reconnect this coolant line.
Intake's above your head.
ARCHER: I had a talk with my tactical officer. We're confident you have
the ability to defend yourselves.
TESSIC: We already tried. There are eight people buried not far from
here who can attest to that.
ARCHER: It would be different this time. We would help you prepare.
TESSIC: I don't want your help. I'm responsible for my people, not you.
They put their trust in me. They depend on me. I'm supposed to protect
them! Look at me I can barely keep this crawler running. You say you
and your tactical officer want to help us. Even if you do once you're
gone, we'll be alone again waiting for them to come back.
ARCHER: There's a saying on my world. Give a man a fish and he eats for
a day. Teach him to fish, and he eats for a lifetime.
 [Inside a module]
 (A table has been laid out with an assortment of
weaponry.)
REED: I was hoping for a bit more to work with.
MAKLII: They do a decent job keeping the shib'a lizards from chewing on
the power couplings.
REED: With a few modifications these should be effective against more
than lizards.
MAKLII: You must have a well stocked armoury onboard Enterprise.
REED: But this battle won't be won with firepower. Deception and
surprise can be just as potent as brute force.
T'POL: Klingons are aggressive warriors but their tactics are crude.
They're slow to adapt to changing circumstances.
TESSIC: This all sounds very ambitious. What exactly are you expecting
us to do?
ARCHER: You're going to lure them into a trap.
TESSIC: What kind of trap?
TUCKER: A very hot one. The deuterium in those wellheads, how much
pressure is it under? Three, four thousand millibars?
MAKLII: Five.
TUCKER: Should create some interesting fireworks.
TESSIC: You'll never get the Klingons near that deuterium field. They
know it isn't safe.
MAKLII: They may be crude, but they're not fools.
ARCHER: That's where deception and surprise come in. Did you bring the
map I asked you for?
TESSIC: It's right here.
ARCHER: The structures in the colony, they're mostly modular, right?
TESSIC: They're all modular. Most deuterium fields are depleted within
three or four years at most. It forces us to be itinerant.
ARCHER: So you're saying you could relocate these buildings in a
relatively short time.
MAKLII: It depends where you're suggesting we relocate them.
ARCHER: About fifty metres to the south, right here.
TESSIC: What good would that do? The terrain there is no different than
where the town is now.
TUCKER: That's what we're counting on. If we can move the structures
and the rigs, everything should look pretty much like it did yesterday.
MAKLII: Everything except the well-heads.
ARCHER: They'll have to be capped off, and camouflaged.
TESSIC: We can do that.
REED: The gullies on this hillside, are they deep enough to hide in?
TESSIC: If you keep your head down.
T'POL: We'll shuttle small groups to Enterprise for whatever training
we have time for. Preferably people who have experience with weapons.
ARCHER: We've got three days. We should get to work.
TESSIC: What are we waiting for? (All through the night, crew and colonists
dismantle buildings, shut down wells and tractor pumps to the new
location.)
TUCKER: One more metre. Okay, shut her down.
 [Armoury]
 REED: You ready? (Hoshi starts up the training
target.) REED: And begin.
(Maklii tries to hit the flying ball, and fails every time.)
MAKLII: Shib'a lizards don't move that fast.
HOSHI: Do you mind, Lieutenant? (She goes over to Maklii.) HOSHI: I can see your
finger tensing on the trigger before you fire. It's throwing off your
aim. I used to make the same mistake. Keep your eye on the target and
don't squeeze the trigger until you have a clear shot. (She demonstrates,
and hits the target every time.) HOSHI: Try again.
 [Settlement]
 (The furniture is being arranged inside the
module.)
TUCKER: I think the table was a little bit to the left. (He hands over
water.)
ARCHER: Thanks. How are things going with the pumps?
TUCKER: It'll be tomorrow before they're all in place. We started
capping off the heads.
ARCHER: Let me know. (Archer takes another piece of furniture.) ARCHER: I got it. If
you need more people.
TUCKER: I rigged two ignition sequences. The perimeter and the centre
are on separate circuits.
ARCHER: I thought taking the town apart was tough. But putting it back
together.
TUCKER: This plan is a long shot, isn't it?
ARCHER: Do you think it's a mistake?
TUCKER: I didn't say that.
ARCHER: I've never liked bullies, Trip. Not on Earth and not out here.
 [Armoury]
 (Three men, a woman and Travis are attending the
defence class.)
T'POL: Klingons carry disrupters but they prefer to use bladed weapons
in combat. The two most common being the bat'leth, a curved, bilateral
sword and the mek'leth, a two-pronged dagger. The bat'leth can
decapitate its victim with one stroke while the mek'leth is typically
used to slash the throat or disembowel. I cannot teach you to defend
yourselves against these weapons. The Vulcan martial art, Suus Mahna,
takes years to master. However, I can teach you a simple evasive
technique. Ensign Mayweather. (T'Pol picks up a piece of pipe.) T'POL: Since I don't
have a bat'leth, this will have to suffice. (She throws the pipe to Travis.) T'POL: Try
to strike me. You won't hurt me.
TRAVIS: It's not you that I'm worried about. (He swings it and she
dodges either side then rolls away.)
T'POL: That was called the Navorkot. It isn't difficult to learn. Who
would like to try first?
 [Settlement]
 (Night again, and Q'ell brings water to Tucker.)
TUCKER: Thanks.
Q'ELL: Lieutenant Reed said I'd have to hide in the canyons when the
Klingons come back.
TUCKER: He doesn't want you to get hurt.
Q'ELL: But I want to help. I can shoot a shib'a lizard from forty
metres.
TUCKER: Malcolm's got this rule. You've got to be taller than the gun
to use it.
Q'ELL: I don't want to hide.
TUCKER: Shooting at a lizard is a whole lot different than shooting at
a person, and lizards don't shoot back. When those Klingons show up I
want you to do exactly what Lieutenant Reed says. Understood?
Q'ELL: Yes, sir. (In the Armoury, the trainee gunmen are turning
into marksmen. By morning, the wells are capped off and concealed under rock and
rubble.)
 [Inside a module]
 ARCHER: We had a little trouble moving one of the
pumps, but it's in place now. We're ready.
TESSIC: I just hope everyone survives this. Your people, as well as
mine.
ARCHER: We left Earth just over a year ago to explore, to meet people
like you. We'd only been out of Spacedock for three days when we found
ourselves in a full-fledged firefight with some pretty nasty characters
called the Suliban. I got shot in the leg. Just before I passed out I
remembered thinking this isn't what I signed up for. I should be
mapping star clusters or making first contact with friendly species.
But when those Suliban started firing at my crew I knew I didn't have
any choice but to fight back. I'm not ashamed to admit I was nervous.
I'm nervous now. But I know we can do this. (comm. chirps) Archer.
TRAVIS [OC]: The Klingon ship just dropped out of warp, Captain.
ARCHER: Acknowledged.
 [Settlement]
(The wind blows through the deserted settlement as
the Klingons beam in.)
KOROK: Listen.
KLINGON 1: What?
KOROK: The pumps. They're silent. (raises his voice) Where's your
hospitality? This is no way to treat your friends. Show yourselves!
(He gives orders in Klingon and his men start to search the
modules. Maklii makes a bird call, and another man shows himself
then runs off.
The Klingons follow and the first one gets knocked down by a wire
suddenly pulled taut. Then the shooting starts and they take cover. The
Starfleet crew have dressed like the colonists, including bandanas to
conceal their lack of forehead markings.)
KOROK: This will cost you more than deuterium!
(A woman with excellent aim hits a Klingon with a rock.)
KLINGON 1: P'taQ! (he catches up to her and her evasion training keeps
her alive.  Another Klingon enters a module, sees a loose section and thinks he
will catch someone escaping around the back. Archer knocks him out with
a pipe. Tessic also uses the evasion technique, then T'Pol wades in.)
T'POL: Hey! (As her feet connect with the Klingon's face, several
times. She knocks him out and they leave the scene.) T'POL: Come on.
KLINGON 1: There. (He aims his weapon at Maklii in amongst the pumps.)
KOROK: What are you doing? You'll kill us all. Those wellheads, they're
under great pressure. If you ignite them you'll incinerate the entire
town. (Maklii runs away)
KLINGON 1: They're making fools of us. (Korok finally uses his binoculars.)
KOROK: They're hiding in the dirt like
Targ. They'll learn to show us respect. We'll kill another four.
Perhaps the boy as well.
(As the Klingons march towards the gullies where the fighters are
concealed)
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: They're too far south.
REED: We've got to get them to move fifty metres to our left.
ARCHER: Everybody, this way.
(The Klingons spot them moving, and some throw down their bat'leths to
draw their disruptors.)
REED: A little farther. This is good. (Archer watches Korok advance on a pile of stones.)
ARCHER: A few more metres.
(Korok's hobnails connect with metal in the ground, and he finally
takes note of the landscape.)
KOROK: This shouldn't be here.
ARCHER: Now.
(Trip sets off his charges and the Klingons are surrounded by a circle
of fire.)
ARCHER: They're all yours, Tessic.
TESSIC: Korok! (The Klingons aim their disruptors at him.)TESSIC:  I wouldn't
do that. There's two more wellheads by your feet. Leave here now or
we'll ignite them.
KOROK: P'taQ. You'll live to regret this.
TESSIC: If you're thinking about coming back, I wouldn't advise it.
We'll be ready. We're not afraid of you anymore. (Korok holsters his weapon.)
KOROK: We can find deuterium anywhere. Yours
isn't fit for a garbage scow. (He speaks into his communicator and the
party is beamed away. The colonists rejoice at their victory.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 TUCKER: Unless you're planning to join Starfleet
I'm afraid you'll have to give up that chair.
Q'ELL: I wish you didn't have to leave.
TUCKER: Yeah, that's one of the tough things about my job. Saying
goodbye to people like you and your friends. Oh, almost forgot. (He gets a
PADD out of a case.) TUCKER: Schematics for Enterprise. You said you like to
look at starships. This one'll knock your socks off.
Q'ELL: Thanks. Do you think you'll come back?
TUCKER: Who knows? Our engines need a lot of deuterium.
 [Settlement]
 (Everyone is cleaned up and back in proper desert
uniform.)
ARCHER: There must be over a thousand litres here.
MAKLII: Two thousand.
ARCHER: Our deal was for two hundred.
TESSIC: Our deal was for power cells, medical supplies and repair work.
You provided us with much more than that.
MAKLII: Besides, we seem to have a surplus at the moment. (Q'ell runs
out to join them.) MAKLII: Give your crew our thanks.
ARCHER: Have a good season.
(They get into the shuttlepod and fly off, leaving the deuterium
behind.)

  [T'Pol's
quarters]
 [T'Pol is lying in bed, reading a Vulcan book,
when her monitor sounds off.)
VULCAN [on monitor]: Sub-Commander?
T'POL: Yes?
VULCAN [on monitor]: Did I wake you?
T'POL: It's all right. Is something wrong?
VULCAN [on monitor]: We've located Menos.
T'POL: Where?
VULCAN [on monitor]: Less than three days from your present location.
T'POL: Are you certain it's him?
VULCAN [on monitor]: Yes.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in. (T'Pol enters.) ARCHER: Good morning.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: Toast?
T'POL: No, thank you.
ARCHER: What can I do for you?
T'POL: Admiral Forrest will be calling you this afternoon, sir.
ARCHER: Oh, will he? And how would you know that?
T'POL: I was contacted by the Vulcan High Command last night. They've
requested my services regarding a matter of security.
ARCHER: And they've already asked Admiral Forrest?
T'POL: He should be contacting you this afternoon.
ARCHER: Matter of security?
T'POL: The Admiral will inform you that Enterprise will be asked to
alter course to the Pernaia system, where I will need a shuttlepod and
a pilot for three to five days.
ARCHER: You didn't answer my question. What kind of matter of security?
T'POL: A Vulcan ship will rendezvous with the shuttlepod when my
mission is completed.
ARCHER: They're sending you to get somebody. Somebody you'll be handing
over to the Vulcans. Why you?
T'POL: Admiral Forrest will be contacting you this afternoon.
ARCHER: Thanks for being so enlightening. Dismissed.
 Captain's Log, supplemental. As anticipated, I was
contacted by Admiral Forrest who has ordered us to accommodate the
Vulcans' request.
 [Situation room]
 ARCHER: Did you find the co-ordinates?
TRAVIS: Pernaia Prime. Yes, sir.
ARCHER: Set a course. When we arrive, you'll be piloting the
shuttlepod.
TRAVIS: Where exactly will we be going?
ARCHER: Somewhere in the Pernaia System, no doubt. As far as the exact
location, Admiral Forrest doesn't even know that. It seems the
Sub-Commander's on a highly classified mission.
TUCKER: Is this Pernaia Prime inhabited?
HOSHI: The Vulcan database says it has a methane-based atmosphere.
TUCKER: So, she's going to another planet in the system. Are we
supposed to play some kind of guessing game? (T'Pol gives Trip a Look, but doesn't speak.)
ARCHER: No, we're
supposed to wait at Pernaia Prime for T'Pol and Travis to finish their
mission.
TUCKER: And do what in the meantime?
REED: I could use a few days to recalibrate the torpedo launchers.
TUCKER: I could polish all the handles and rails in Engineering. (He gets
a Look from Archer this time.) TUCKER: I guess I could purge the impulse
reactors.
ARCHER: It's only for a few days. We've got plenty to keep ourselves
busy. Is there anything specific you and Travis are going to need?
T'POL: Cold-weather gear, restraints and phase pistols.
 [Archer's quarters]
 (Archer is in bed, bouncing a ball against the
bulkhead when the door bell chimes.)
ARCHER: Come in. (T'Pol enters.) ARCHER: If the Vulcan High Command doesn't
approve of the water polo match I'm watching, I'd be happy to find
another.
T'POL: Your orders to bring me to Pernaia came from Starfleet, not the
High Command.
ARCHER: What can I do for you?
T'POL: I have a personal matter I'd like to discuss. (She deliberately
moves to block his view of the game on his desk monitor. He switches it
off.) T'POL: Before I joined the Science Directorate I was assigned to the
Ministry of Security. I was trained in reconnaissance and retrieval.
ARCHER: Move over, Porthos. Let the lady sit down. Sounds like this is
going to be good. Come on, sit down. (She sits.) ARCHER: How long ago are we
talking about?
T'POL: I completed my training seventeen years ago.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL: Are you familiar with a planet called Agaron?
ARCHER: They're close allies with the Vulcans, right?
T'POL: Not always. Agaron was a very corrupt world. When their leaders
were first trying to forge an alliance with Vulcan they asked for our
assistance. That was nearly thirty years ago. Hundreds of our agents
were surgically altered and sent to infiltrate the most criminal
factions of Agaron society. Eventually, they were instrumental in the
overthrow of those factions.
ARCHER: You're not going to tell me you're one of those agents.
T'POL: I'm not that old, Captain. After the alliance was formalised,
the Vulcan agents were recalled. They all returned voluntarily, all but
nineteen.
ARCHER: I guess even Vulcans can fall prey to temptation.
T'POL: The Ministry of Security sent a team of newly-trained operatives
to retrieve them. I was only able to apprehend five of the six
fugitives assigned to me.
ARCHER: So tomorrow you get to pick up number six. Why couldn't someone
else do it? Why you?
T'POL: The Ministry considers it a matter of honour.
ARCHER: How very Vulcan. So, why have you decided to tell me all this?
T'POL: I'd like you to come with me.
ARCHER: What?
T'POL: The man I'm being sent to apprehend is extremely dangerous. It
would be wise for me to have assistance.
ARCHER: You said there's a Vulcan ship coming. I'm sure they can
provide all the assistance you'll need.
T'POL: I'd prefer it if you'd come with me, Captain.
ARCHER: Why?
T'POL: I need to be with someone I can trust. If you don't wish to help
me, I understand. Good night. (gets up to leave)
ARCHER: What's his name? The man we're going to apprehend.
T'POL: Menos.
ARCHER: See you in the morning.
 [Corridor]
 TUCKER: If you agreed to go with her you must know
something about what she's up to.
ARCHER: We'll be back in three to five days, Trip. If that Vulcan ship
comes snooping around, the last thing you want to tell them is that I'm
with T'Pol.
TUCKER: Why's that? Why would you being with her be a problem to them?
ARCHER: Three to five days, Trip.
TUCKER: Come on, Captain. Last night, you were just as frustrated as I
was about having to sit on your hands while she goes off and does
whatever it is she's going off to do.
 [Turbolift]
 TUCKER: This isn't just a case of curiosity. What
if you get hurt, kidnapped? You put me in charge of this ship and you
won't tell me where you're going? How am I supposed to be a good
temporary Captain if I don't know where my people are? Tell me that.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER: She's got some unfinished business, Trip.
I'm not sure why, but she needs me to go along. We'll be okay.
 [Launch bay]
 TUCKER: There are a lot of definitions of
unfinished business. Could you be a little more specific?
ARCHER: You're in charge, Commander. (to T'Pol) Have you given Travis
the coordinates?
T'POL: Yes.
TUCKER: Have fun.
(The shuttlepod launches.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 (A series of images of a man is being run on a
monitor.)
T'POL: Before he was sent to Agaron, the dorsal lobes of his ears were
surgically altered. The ridge on his forehead was added sometime
afterward.
ARCHER: Why didn't he want to come home?
T'POL: He was assigned to infiltrate a cell of smugglers. He learned
their craft. He became very proficient at it, amassed a large fortune.
ARCHER: Smuggling what?
T'POL: Synthetic biotoxins used to manufacture transgenic weapons. I
spent three months trying to find him. He used his wealth wisely.
Whenever I'd get close, I'd find he'd left a day or two before.
ARCHER: You never found him?
T'POL: Only once, on Risa. They thought they were invulnerable.
ARCHER: They?
T'POL: He. He thought he was invulnerable there, that no one would
think to look for him on such a peaceful place.
ARCHER: What happened?
T'POL: I got very close. Twenty metres, maybe ten. (She has a memory of running
through foliage.)
ARCHER: T'Pol?
T'POL: I never found him again. No one did. Not until now.
(It's snowing when the shuttlepod lands by some buildings on the side
of a mountain.)
 [Tavern]
 (Many different races have come here to drink, and
other things, when the three enter in their thermal gear. T'Pol's scanner is beeping.)
T'POL: He's here.
ARCHER: Where?
T'POL: Within thirty metres.
ARCHER: (to Travis) If he sees T'Pol, he may try to get to his ship.
(Travis hangs back by the door as the other two split up to search.
T'Pol sees Menos in a mirror but another alien shoves her out of the
way and he's gone again.)
T'POL: He saw me.
ARCHER: Which way?
T'POL: I'm not certain.
(Archer jumps onto a table and whistles to Travis, then ducks as shots
are fired towards him. It's Menos trying to make his escape. An alien
snarls something at Archer.)
ARCHER: I couldn't agree more.
(Travis gets their quarry flat on his back on the floor.)
TRAVIS: Don't move.
(T'Pol gives Archer the handcuffs and he puts them on Menos.)
MENOS: You have no jurisdiction here.
T'POL: Follow me.
 [Captain's mess]
 (Trip is watching a water polo match on a monitor
when the door bell chimes.)
TUCKER: Come in. Gentlemen, come in. Glad you could join me.
REED: Water polo?
TUCKER: Very exciting sport. You should learn more about it. (He switches
it off.) TUCKER: Please, sit down. I had Chef prepare a special lunch. Bangers
and mash for you, and, Denobulan sausage for the Doctor.
PHLOX: Very nice.
REED: Are you sure the Captain wouldn't have a problem with you using
his dining room?
TUCKER: Acting Captain, Captain's Mess. I don't see a problem. Thank
you, Crewman. (Lunch is served.) TUCKER: Enjoy.
PHLOX: Thank you. Oh, I detected a lymphatic virus on board this morning. Most
likely it sneaked in with one of the deuterium canisters. We should
probably inoculate the crew.
TUCKER: Why didn't the bio-scanners detect it?
PHLOX: Well, it's a very reliable device, but it's not perfect. The
inoculation does have some side effects.
TUCKER: What kind of side effects?
PHLOX: Headache, nausea, diarrhoea. But they would subside in a day or
two. Do I have your permission?
TUCKER: I'd hate to be responsible for giving the crew the runs. Maybe
you should wait till the Captain gets back.
PHLOX: I'm afraid the virus will have spread by then. I really need an
answer today.
TUCKER: Why don't I get back to you later, Doc?
PHLOX: Not too much later.
REED: While we're on the subject of approvals, I promised Captain
Archer that I'd recalibrate the torpedo launchers. I'll need to divert
computer access from Main Engineering.
TUCKER: That would mean we'd have to power down the warp core.
REED: It'll only be for a day. We're not exactly going anywhere.
TUCKER: We're also not at war. I'm just not comfortable taking the
engines offline right now.
REED: Is that the Chief Engineer talking, or the Acting Captain?
TUCKER: Let me get back to you. (comm. beeps) Tucker.
HOSHI [OC]: We were just hailed by the Vulcan ship Nyran, sir. It's
approaching the system at high warp. They're asking to speak with
Captain Archer.
TUCKER: Tell them the Captain's indisposed at the moment. He'll get
back to them in a little while.
HOSHI [OC]: Yes, sir.
TUCKER: The Captain said not to tell the Vulcans he went with T'Pol. He
was very emphatic about that.
PHLOX: It's going to be difficult to convince them he's indisposed for
the next four days.
TUCKER: (answers comm.) Go ahead.
HOSHI [OC]: Captain Tavek says he has a message from Admiral Forrest.
He seems very anxious to speak with Captain Archer. What shall I tell
him?
TUCKER: I'll get back to you. (He despairs of ever taking a mouthful of
butterfly pasta.)
 [Office]
 DOCKMASTER: Your warrant is valid, but you won't
be able to take him. Not for at least four hours. We've begun
thermalising the landing deck.
T'POL: We just need to get him to our ship.
DOCKMASTER: There's a half centimetre of xylathoric acid on that deck.
I wouldn't recommend it. Not if you value those pretty feet of yours.
ARCHER: Do you have somewhere we can put him until we leave?
DOCKMASTER: Does this look like a prison to you?
 [Tavern]
 (Menos is handcuffed to a table.)
ARCHER: Any one of these people could be working with him.
T'POL: The Ministry of Security very clear about that. He works alone.
MENOS: I haven't always.
(T'Pol has memories of running through foliage again.)
MENOS: You're human. And you as well. They wanted to rehabilitate me,
bring me home, flatten my forehead and re-point my ears. They wanted to
teach me to forget the life they had taught me so carefully how to
live. They assumed I had become corrupt. and that left to my own
devices I would remain corrupt. Three years in a Vulcan clinic.
Rehabilitation. Can you blame me for running? I'm not a thief. I'm not
a smuggler. I never was. I worked with smugglers. I worked very close
with them for a long time. It's what I had been trained to do. Do you
know how I've survived the last twenty years? How I've fed my family? I
haul spent warp injector casings. Not a very popular occupation, but a
necessary one. A doctor on Andoria says that my hemolytic cell count is
over three thousand. You don't find too many old men hauling spent
injector casings. In my left front pocket, if you don't mind. (Travis
moves to oblige.)
T'POL: I wouldn't. It may be a weapon.
MENOS: It's a hologram of my family. They won't hurt you.
(Archer nods, Travis takes out the holoprojector and switches it on. We
see a woman and two young girls, who wave.)
MENOS: The injector casings are going to take me away from them soon
enough. I don't want to die in a Vulcan prison.
T'POL: The information that I was given says that you buy high grade
biotoxins and sell them to anyone who will meet your price.
MENOS: If all of the Ministry's reports about me were true I could
easily shape-shift and slip out of these restraints, or sprout wings
and fly to my ship.
ARCHER: Why should she believe a fugitive and not her own government?
MENOS: Because her government sent one hundred nine agents to Agaron
thirty years ago, and they want all one hundred nine accounted for,
Right or wrong, dead or alive.
ARCHER: If you're innocent, I'm sure you'll be given a chance to defend
yourself.
MENOS: Bur I'm guilty. I'm guilty of not returning when I was told to.
I'm innocent of selling biotoxins but I'm guilty of being a fugitive.
But I don't deserve to go to prison, and I don't deserve to be shot.
ARCHER: We're here to take you to Vulcan. No one's going to shoot you.
MENOS: What about her?
(Again, images of two men running, then something with a Vulcan
restraining someone while another reads a book.)
T'POL: (pulling a knife) You're a liar.
ARCHER: T'Pol! (She cuts a couple of strips from Menos's jacket and
ties them around her feet.) ARCHER: What are you doing? T'Pol?
T'POL: He's not telling the truth.
ARCHER: Where the hell are you going? T'Pol!
T'POL: He says he has a ship full of injector casings. (They head outside.)
ARCHER: But the platform's covered with acid!
(T'Pol runs, and remembers running in the past.)
 [Menos' ship]
 (She opens a couple of the containers in his hold,
and reveals casings in them. She remembers the chase, when one of the
runners fell.)
MENOS: Jossen!
(She opens another case and stabs into it with her crowbar, then sinks
to her knees.)
 [Bridge]
(Tucker adds an extra pip to his uniform.)
TUCKER: You're sure?
HOSHI: There's no record of them ever having spoken, but I can't be
certain.
TUCKER: Has he ever been to Earth?
HOSHI: If he has, the Vulcan database doesn't mention it.
TUCKER: I hope they haven't put Starfleet yearbook photos into that
database. Let's get this over with. (A stern Vulcan appears on the
viewscreen.) Captain Tavek, is there something I can do for you?
TAVEK [on viewscreen]: Captain Archer?
TUCKER: Yes. Is there a problem?
TAVEK [on viewscreen]: You seem very young for a Starfleet Captain.
TUCKER: Healthy living. You have a message from Admiral Forrest?
TAVEK [on viewscreen]: I'm not certain what this means, but the Admiral
asked me to inform you that Cal beat Stanford, seven to three.
TUCKER: I'll be sure to tell him.
TAVEK [on viewscreen]: Tell who?
TUCKER: I'm afraid it's confidential. Thank you for relaying the
message. Archer out.
(He sits down in the Captain's chair, breathes out deeply and slumps.)
 [Tavern]
 (People stare as T'Pol returns.)
ARCHER: That wasn't too smart. You could have been hurt. What did you
find?
T'POL: Spent injector casings.
ARCHER: You'll have to go through decon when we get back.
T'POL: I want to speak to Menos alone. Would you allow me to do that?
ARCHER: Come on, Travis. Let's see if we can find something to eat.
(They leave her with Menos, who is still shackled to the table leg.)
T'POL: Who is Jossen?
MENOS: You didn't find what you were looking for, did you?
T'POL: Who is Jossen?
MENOS: If this is your idea of humour. (T'Pol points a phase pistol at him.)
T'POL: Tell me who he is.
MENOS: Jossen was no different than me. He didn't want to be
rehabilitated, either.
(She sees the man fall to the ground then reach for a holster.)
T'POL: Where did I meet him?
MENOS: Meet him? On Risa. Jossen and I were on Risa in the Tropical
Zone. We were innocent of the crimes the Ministry had accused us of but
we were running, all the same. Why do you want me to tell you things
you already know?
T'POL: You're telling me lies.
MENOS: No. The truth.
T'POL: I followed you to Risa, no one else. I bribed the Tellarite
transport captain who brought you there. He told me exactly where to
find you. I wasn't looking for anyone else.
MENOS: Then why are you asking me about Jossen? He never hurt anyone.
He didn't deserve to be hunted down like an animal. (She remembers him going for his holster, and she fires her own
weapon. The birds fly from the tree-tops at the sound.)
T'POL: I killed him.
MENOS: Yes, and he didn't deserve to be killed. He was an innocent man,
just like I am.
(She remembers the old Vulcan reading from a book, and another holding
her down.)
MENOS: You really don't remember. How is that possible? Why did you
kill him? He never would have hurt you.
T'POL: Stop talking.
MENOS: You're a Vulcan. You're trained to repress the emotion of
killing, not the memory of the act.
T'POL: I said, stop talking!
MENOS: Look what it's done to you, taking an innocent life. Bringing me
back to Vulcan will be no different. You'll be destroying another life.
How will that affect you? Will you conveniently forget what you're
about to do to me?
(T'Pol gets up and pushes her way through the crowd to Archer and Travis.)
ARCHER: Where's Menos? (He sees he's still at the table and speaks to
Travis.) ARCHER: Get back over there.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
 [Outside the Tavern]
ARCHER: What happened?
T'POL: There were seven.
ARCHER: Seven what?
T'POL: I was sent to bring back seven fugitives, not six.
ARCHER: I don't understand.
T'POL: Menos had a partner, or a friend. I'm not sure. His name was
Jossen. I followed them both to Risa, not just Menos. The day I told
you I saw Menos and lost him, I saw Jossen as well. They tried to
escape. Jossen fell to the ground. He began to reach for his weapon.
ARCHER: But you fired first?
T'POL: I had forgotten all of it, until today.
ARCHER: How?
T'POL: Have you heard of the Fullara?
ARCHER: No.
T'POL: It's an obsolete Vulcan ritual where the memory of an event is
repressed along with the emotions associated with it.
ARCHER: And you had this.
T'POL: Fullara.
ARCHER: This Fullara ritual performed?
T'POL: When I returned to Vulcan, I was unsettled. I resigned my
position with the Ministry and sought guidance at the Sanctuary of
P'Jem. For months, one of the Elders worked with me to control the
guilt, to restrain the despair of having taken a life, but the feelings
remained.
ARCHER: Why would you feel guilty if this Jossen was about to fire at
you?
T'POL: I suppose I was never certain what his intentions were. The
Elder had no choice but to perform the ritual. When I left the
Sanctuary I didn't remember anything about Jossen or the Fullara.
ARCHER: When did it start coming back?
T'POL: When the first call came in about this new mission. Maybe that's
why I wanted you with me. What if Jossen wasn't a smuggler? What if he
was innocent? Then it wouldn't have mattered whether he intended to use
that weapon or not.
ARCHER: That doesn't make any sense. What's Menos been telling you?
T'POL: Menos's ship was filled with injector casings, nothing else. He
has a family. Our scans should be able to confirm if he's dying of
radiation poisoning.
ARCHER: What's he been telling you?
(There's a sudden commotion, and people come rushing out of the Tavern.
There's a fire inside, and the pair run in to see Menos in the middle
of the flames still shackled to the other table.)
TRAVIS: He kicked over the table!
ARCHER: And you claim you're a peaceful man.
MENOS: Ironic, isn't it? Burning to death on a frozen moon? But I'd
rather die here than be brought back and punished for crimes I never
committed.
ARCHER: T'Pol! (She enters the flames to free Menos from the cuffs.)
ARCHER: Refasten them. (A beam falls.)
T'POL: Where's Menos?
ARCHER: Travis! Come on.
 [Outside the Tavern]
 ARCHER: Where's his ship? Your mission is to
return him to Vulcan, not determine whether he's guilty or innocent.
Where's his ship?
(As the fire spreads through the dock, lots of ships are taking off.)
 [Menos' ship]
 T'POL: He's not aboard.
ARCHER: Let's be sure. (They go through to the cargo hold.) ARCHER: We'll all
need to go through decon now.
T'POL: He's not here.
ARCHER: Was that the only way in? Go back to the cockpit, Travis.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: Get life support fired up if you can. It's pretty cold. (Travis
shuts the door behind him.) ARCHER: He should've gotten here before us. This
ship shouldn't be here.
T'POL: Why risk using his own vessel? He'd know we'd follow him.
ARCHER: So he could've left with any one of those other ships.
T'POL: Any one of them.
ARCHER: You seem okay with that.
T'POL: When we return to Enterprise I'll inform the Vulcan ship that
Menos escaped. If the High Command wishes, they can question as many of
the vessels that left here as they can find.
ARCHER: You're giving up a lot easier than I would've guessed.
T'POL: He's obviously gone.
ARCHER: We don't know that. He got to you, didn't he? You're beginning
to doubt yourself. He figured if he could get you to question what you
did seventeen years ago, you'd begin to question what you're doing
right now.
T'POL: I may have killed an innocent man seventeen years ago.
ARCHER: Did Jossen reach for his weapon or not?
T'POL: I don't know.
ARCHER: Is that what you remember, or what Menos wants you to remember?
T'POL: What's the difference?
ARCHER: There's a big difference. He's playing on your guilt. Don't you
see that?
T'POL: That's impossible. I went to P'Jem. They performed the ritual.
ARCHER: Don't give me that! Your emotional immune system started to
collapse again the minute you remembered what happened that day on
Risa.
TRAVIS: Captain.
ARCHER: What is it, Travis?
TRAVIS: There's something funny up here, sir. Think you could take a
look?
(Archer goes through to the cockpit.)
ARCHER: What's up?
TRAVIS: After I got the board running, I brought life support up to
level three. As soon as I got more light in here, I noticed some
condensation on this sub-panel.
ARCHER: There's a hell of a lot of energy flowing through those
circuits. Any idea what they are?
TRAVIS: Our scanner showed everything powered down.
ARCHER: Well, obviously something's powered up. There's one way to find
out what it is.
(He turns the circuits off, and back in the cargo hold, a camouflaged
forcefield comes down to reveal -) MENOS: I'm a very patient man,
T'Pol. (He's holding a rifle, she draws her pistol.) MENOS: I was simply waiting
for you to leave, but your Captain's curiosity has put an end to that.
Would you please lower your weapon? (She does. Archer enters the cargo hold.)
ARCHER: There's some kind of energy field
running.
MENOS: I don't want to harm T'Pol, Captain, but I will.
ARCHER: Those are violent words for a peaceful man.
MENOS: At the moment, I'm a man who needs to survive. There's a locker
right next to you. I want you to both put your weapons down and then
walk into it. You won't be hurt.
ARCHER: What about her?
MENOS: T'Pol is my guarantee that the two of you will walk quickly and
quietly into the locker. Please. (Travis and Archer go into the locker
and shut the door behind themselves.) MENOS: (to T'Pol) The locking code is one
six six one. There's a very specific tone when it's entered properly.
(But before she can enter it, Archer bursts out, grabs both weapons
from the top of a drum and the shooting starts.)
ARCHER: You okay?
T'POL: Yes.
(Archer throws a pistol to Travis who takes a position near the door.)
ARCHER: We don't do quickly and quietly very well but we are good at
arithmetic. It seems there are three of us and only one of you.
MENOS: Stop! Please! (He stands and puts his rifle down.)
ARCHER: I don't trust this guy, Travis. Find something to tie him up
with.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
(Menos kneels down.)
ARCHER: What are you doing? (Menos pulls a lever in the floor and a
trapdoor opens.) ARCHER: Get up! (Menos drops down out of the ship and runs
across the dock.)
 [Outside - space dock]
 (T'Pol is the first one out to follow Menos.)
T'POL: Stop!
MENOS: You're not going to shoot me, T'Pol. You're not going to kill
another innocent man. This is none of your concern, Captain. You know
nothing about what happened on Risa. (He turns and walks away into the
snowstorm.)
T'POL: Captain?
ARCHER: Why did you want me here?
T'POL: Because I trust you.
ARCHER: Then trust me. You were sent to apprehend him, not to judge
him.
(She fires at Menos.)
 [Menos' ship]
 ARCHER: (securing their prisoner) He's not going
to get out of that too quickly.
TRAVIS: I think I know why he was so nervous about us firing at him
while he was over here. Look at this.
T'POL: (scanning the canisters revealed by the missing forcefield)
Biotoxins. If one of our weapons had struck this.
ARCHER: I guess he was hauling more than injector casings after all.
T'POL: I guess he was.(The shuttlepod returns to Enterprise.)
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. The Vulcan ship Nyran was waiting at
the prearranged coordinates. After transferring Menos to their
custody, we've returned to Enterprise.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: What's your status, Trip?
TUCKER [OC]: Everything's ready to go, Captain. Welcome back.
ARCHER: Thanks. We'll be going to warp three.
TUCKER [OC]: You got it.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Now that your secret mission is over you
think you can give your Chief Engineer a little hint about what you
were up to?
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Did I say warp three? I meant warp four,
Commander.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Not even a hint? Warp four. Aye, Captain.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in. (T'Pol enters.) ARCHER: Sub-Commander. Am
I about to get another call from Admiral Forrest?
T'POL: No, sir.
ARCHER: Sorry. Dealing with these memories it's not going to be easy
for you, is it?
T'POL: No, it's not.
ARCHER: If you feel you need a leave of absence.
T'POL: That won't be necessary. I was much younger then.
ARCHER: You've also spent a lot of time around humans lately.
T'POL: You do have a way of putting questionable actions behind you.
ARCHER: When you don't have the ability to repress emotions, you learn
to deal with them and move on. Was there something else?
T'POL: If you ever need someone you can trust.
ARCHER: I won't forget.

    Original Airdate: Nov 13, 2002
[Launch bay]
      (A shuttlepod has just returned from a planet. It's crew are not in uniform and they have foreheads with
      distinctive lines across them and no eyebrows.)
      HOSHI: I need to spend more time in the gym.
      ARCHER: If I knew there were going to be so many hills I would have picked a different city to explore.
      REED: It was worth every step, sir. The architecture alone.
      HOSHI: I could have spent all day in that temple.
     
 [Decon chamber]
(Everyone peels off their fake foreheads.)       REED: With your permission, Captain, I'd like to write
      the report to Starfleet. It was my first visit to a pre-warp culture. Seems only fitting.
      HOSHI: I don't suppose it has anything to do with the tactical situation down there.
      REED: Am I that obvious?
      ARCHER: I can't think of a better man for the job. (Phlox looks through the observation window.)
      PHLOX: Welcome home.
      ARCHER: Any unexpected guests?
      PHLOX: Not a single parasite, spore or virus. I take it your expedition was productive?
      ARCHER: Very.
      PHLOX: You're done here.
     
 [Locker room]
      ARCHER: You know, as interesting as that was, it's always good to get home.
      REED: The speaker at the political rally, what was his name? Chancellor Kultrey?
      HOSHI: Kultarey.
      REED: You could write a book about him alone. His speech reminded me of Winston Churchill before the Second World War.
      (He starts hunting through his pockets.)
      ARCHER: Something wrong? Malcolm?
      REED: My communicator.
      ARCHER: What about it?
      REED: It's gone.
     
 [Launch bay]
      (Hoshi is checking down the back of the pods seats as Archer looks underneath outside.)
      REED: It's not in decon. Any luck?
      ARCHER: None yet.
      REED: What about the launch bay crew? Could they have found it while they were securing the pod?
      ARCHER: I've already spoken to them.
      HOSHI: I did everything but tear up the floor plating.
      ARCHER: When was the last time you remember having it?
      REED: I contacted T'Pol to let her know we'd entered the city.
      ARCHER: After that. Did you have any reason to take it out of your pocket?
      REED: No.
      ARCHER: Are you sure?
      REED: I'd remember. Either I dropped it or someone picked my pocket.
      ARCHER: We covered a lot of ground. It could be anywhere.
      HOSHI: I think I can narrow down the search, Captain. An inverse carrier wave should amplify its
      power signature. With any luck, I'll be able to isolate it.
     
 [Bridge]
      HOSHI: I'm getting something. I've got it down to two square kilometres.
      ARCHER: Can you do a little better?
      HOSHI: I'll try.
      TUCKER: Didn't you say something about a war brewing down there?
      ARCHER: We saw a lot of propaganda, but from what we could tell nobody started fighting yet.
      T'POL: It's crucial we retrieve the technology. We can't risk contaminating a pre-warp culture.
      HOSHI: I've isolated the signal to within three city blocks. That's the best I can do, sir.
      REED: This L-shaped structure. isn't that the fountain? The one with the statues. The tavern was
      directly across the street, here. The communicator could have slipped out of my pocket when we sat down.
      ARCHER: It's a good place to start. (to T'Pol) You've got the Bridge. Tell Doctor Phlox we're going to need
      his cosmetic services again.
      TUCKER: You could use another set of eyes down there, Captain.
      ARCHER: I appreciate the offer, Trip, but the fewer set of eyes, the better.
      TUCKER: I'm a regular bloodhound.
      ARCHER: Next time.
     
 [Shuttlepod]
      ARCHER: (piloting) We'll be in range of their surveillance towers in less than two minutes.
      REED: The hull plating's already been polarised.
      ARCHER: Your feet ready for another hike?
      REED: It's not a problem, sir. Captain. my carelessness was inexcusable. I'm prepared
      for whatever reprimand you feel is appropriate.
      ARCHER: How about thirty years in the brig, or maybe a good flogging?
      REED: Sir,
      ARCHER: It was an accident, Malcolm. It could have happened to any of us.
      REED: Three military aircraft, seventy two kilometres off starboard. I suggest you increase our descent vector.
      That should keep us well below their visual threshold.
      (The pod lands in woods just outside the city, at night.)
     
 [Tavern]

     (Archer and Reed sit at a table by the wall, on pew-like benches with very high backs for privacy - and when I can
     remember the name of the pub where I've sat in exactly those type of seat, I'll let you know. Reed has a look on the floor.)
     ARCHER: This was the table?
     REED: Positive.
     ARCHER: Try your scanner.
     BARKEEP: Welcome back. What would you like?
     ARCHER: Can you give us a few minutes?
     BARKEEP: Of course. Where's your friend? The young woman.
     ARCHER: You have a good memory.
     BARKEEP: She was difficult to forget.
     ARCHER: I'll pass along the compliment.
     BARKEEP: Do you live here?
     ARCHER: No, just visiting.
     BARKEEP: We received a shipment of Allakas malt this afternoon.
     ARCHER: Sounds good.
     (The barkeep goes over to another table and gives the men there a special Look.)
     REED: (using scanner) I've got it.
     ARCHER: Where?
     REED: It's in a room, off that corridor.
     ARCHER: Were you in there?
     REED: No.
     (The pair walk slowly across and through the bead curtain, watched by the Barkeep and the other men.)
     REED: There are two people inside.
     ARCHER: Better wait till they come out.
     (They go back into the main room, and three men stand up. A fight starts, but Reed is knocked down and Archer
     has a gun jammed in his back. They're hauled off into that back room, where Pell holds up the missing communicator.)
     PELL: Does this belong to you? What is it?
     ARCHER: I don't know.
     (Reed and Archer are pushed against the wall and searched. Pell finds the phase pistol.)
     PELL: What kind of weapon is this? (silence) Where's General Gosis?
     SOLDIER: On the Eastern perimeter. 
     PELL: Send a level four communiqué and tell him I think we've found a pair of enemy spies.
     Take them to the Complex and put your men on alert. You won't be seeing your friends in the Alliance for a long time.
    
 [Bridge]
     TUCKER: I'm telling you, something's gone wrong. We should hail them.
     HOSHI: If they're in a public place, the communicator would draw attention.
     T'POL: We'll have to take that risk. T'Pol to Captain Archer.
     HOSHI: The comm. line's open.
     T'POL: Captain, please respond. Close the channel.
     TUCKER: Did you get a fix on the signal?
     HOSHI: Somewhere in this district.
     TUCKER: That's more than thirty kilometres from the tavern. Where's the shuttlepod?
     HOSHI: It hasn't moved.
     TUCKER: They couldn't have travelled that far on foot. Not that fast.
     HOSHI: Maybe they took a train or a car.
     TUCKER: If there was a change of plan, they would've told us. 
     T'POL: Try to isolate their biosigns. I want to know exactly where they are.
     HOSHI: There are nearly a hundred thousand people in that part of the city.
     TUCKER: We'd have more luck if we moved into a lower orbit.
     T'POL: Any closer and we'd be detected. Do your best.
    
 [Detention centre - cell]
     (Archer watches a guard on patrol while Reed checks his blisters.)
     ARCHER: Still bothering you?
     REED: I didn't have time to visit the doctor. I wonder if the guard would bring us some Epsom salts,
     if I asked politely.
     ARCHER: I wouldn't count on it.
     REED: We came down to retrieve my communicator. Now we've lost two of them. Not to mention my phase-pistol and a pair
     of scanners.
     ARCHER: I just hope they don't find the shuttlepod.
     REED: If they really think we are spying for this Alliance, perhaps we should consider telling them the truth.
     ARCHER: I'm not sure anyone would believe us.
     REED: It couldn't hurt to try.
     ARCHER: Visitors from another world? There's no way to know how they'd react. The less we say the better.
     REED: Understood.
     (Pell arrives and the door is unlocked.)
     PELL: Follow me.
    
 [Interrogation room]
     (Their equipment is laid out on the table, but the phase pistol is being lovingly fondled.)
     GOSIS: Which of you is the Captain? Something unexpected happened when I was examining this transmitter.
     It began to make a sound, so I opened it. Someone calling herself T'Pol seemed very concerned about
     her Captain's well-being. Which one of you was she trying to contact?
     ARCHER: I'm the Captain.
     GOSIS: The Alliance must be growing desperate if they're recruiting military officers as spies.
     ARCHER: We're not part of the military.
     GOSIS: I suppose you're the Captain of a pleasure boat. This transceiver, what's its frequency, its range?
     ARCHER: I don't know. (Gosis picks up the scanner.)
     GOSIS: This appears to be a computing instrument. Tell me, how does it work? 
     (Pell hits Archer.)
     GOSIS: My superiors expect answers. As an officer, I'm sure you can appreciate that.
     I have no desire to harm you, but I need you to cooperate.
     ARCHER: I'm sorry. I can't help you.
     GOSIS: I trust you enjoyed the rally this morning. That's why you're here, isn't it?
     It's curious, the two of you visiting the city the same day as Chancellor Kultarey.
     Did you come here to observe his security arrangement? Or perhaps assassinate him?
     We're aware of your ancestral claims against our city. It must make a tempting target.
     ARCHER: We're visitors, not spies.
     GOSIS: This T'Pol who tried to contact you, where is she?
     (Pell hits Archer again, and he falls to the floor. Reed leaps up and is clubbed by a soldier with a rifle.
     When they are hauled back onto the chairs, Gosis spots that Archer's prosthetic forehead has come away
     at the edge and he peels it off. Pell does the same to Reed.)
     GOSIS: You've been surgically altered. 
     PELL: General. His blood. It's red.
     GOSIS: Take them to Temec. Have him perform a full examination.
    
 [Situation room]
     HOSHI: They're here, inside this compound.
     TRAVIS: Guard towers, gun emplacements, it's not a hotel.
     TUCKER: We could take Shuttlepod two, set it down here. They're being held less than thirty metres away.
     We'd be back in orbit before anyone knew they were gone.
     T'POL: If you were captured, you'd be giving the inhabitants more technology.
     It would undoubtedly affect the evolution of their society.
     TUCKER: What if they didn't see us coming? We've still got that Suliban cell-ship, the one we used to rescue
     Klaang from the Helix. I've been working on it in my free time. I'm pretty close to figuring out how it works.
     If I can bring the cloak on line, we can get past their defences, grab our people, and no one will see a thing.
     T'POL: Work quickly.
     TUCKER: I could use a hand.
     TRAVIS: Aye, sir. (They leave.)
     T'POL: I suggest we monitor the communiqués coming from the compound. They may tell us what's happening
     to the Captain and Mister Reed.
     HOSHI: Right away.
    
 [Launch bay - Cell ship]
     (The little sphere is wide open.)
     TUCKER: I don't get it. The power converter's engaged. Juice is definitely flowing through these relays.
     So why can we still see the ship?
     TRAVIS: Maybe this panel isn't the cloaking device.
     TUCKER: I've identified every other component. It's got to be it. Run the power-up sequence again.
     TRAVIS: This would be a lot easier if there was a button marked cloak.
     TUCKER: Hold on a minute, Travis. (Tucker presses a device to the centre of a display - there's a shock and he's
     thrown back out of the ship.)
     TRAVIS: Are you all right?
     TUCKER: Just got the wind knocked out of me a bit.
     (Part of his tool box disappears, then Travis spots something else.)
     TRAVIS: Maybe a little more than that. (Tucker lifts his right arm to see most of it has disappeared.)
    
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox scans the missing limb.)      PHLOX: Is there any pain?
     TUCKER: It tingles a little.
     PHLOX: Can you move your fingers?
     TUCKER: How's that?
     PHLOX: You tell me.
     TUCKER: They feel all right. What's your scanner say?
     PHLOX: Very little, I'm afraid. Quantum physics is hardly my specialty, but I'd guess that you
     received an intense dose of whatever particle radiation that ship uses to conceal itself.
     TUCKER: Are you saying I'm permanently cloaked?
     PHLOX: It's difficult to determine, but I suspect your appendage will eventually re-materialise on its own.
     TUCKER: Eventually?
     PHLOX: Come back in an hour. I'll check on your progress.
     TUCKER: What am I supposed to do in the meantime? I can't work like this. (Phlox hands him a rubber glove.)
     PHLOX: I'd also recommend a fresh uniform.
     TUCKER: Thanks.
    
 [Detention centre - courtyard]
     (Gosis has the phase pistol.)
     GOSIS: Shall we try this? (he fires it at a crate of containers.)
     PELL: It's some kind of coherent energy pulse. I thought this technology was only theoretical.
     GOSIS: Our Alliance friends seem to have turned theory into reality.
     PELL: May I? (Gosis gives him the pistol.) GOSIS: There appears to be another setting. (He fires at the crate, and
     it disintegrates in a big shower of sparks.)
     GOSIS: If the Alliance has equipped its troops with these weapons. Make sure the devices are kept
     under guard at all times. Use men you can trust.
     (Pell and guards go indoors. Temec comes out with his examination results.)
     GOSIS: What did you find? 
     TEMEC: See for yourself. (Gosis looks at the x-rays.)
     GOSIS: How is this possible?
     TEMEC: There's only one explanation. Our prisoners belong to another species.
    
 [Detention centre - interrogation room]
     GOSIS: Doctor Temec tells me your deformities are not the work of a surgeon. He found no obvious incisions or scar tissue.
     You're even more abnormal on the inside. A redundant renal organ and you're missing four thoracic vertebrae.
     Temec can't even begin to explain this mass. As for your red blood, the doctor tells me your haemoglobin
     is based on iron, a toxic element. He conducted the test four times to be certain.
     He has a theory about where you came from. I found it difficult to believe until I saw this.
     One of our surveillance aircraft took this image early this morning.
     The pilot said the object was traveling at very high speed. Can you explain?
     (He shows them a photograph with the silhouette of a shuttlepod on it.)
     TEMEC: None of the other planets in our system are capable of supporting life. Where do you come from?
     GOSIS: Our scientists tell me it's unlikely that a craft of this size could have travelled from another star system.
     They suspect a larger ship must be somewhere nearby. Perhaps orbiting our planet.
     (He grabs Archer and hauls him to his feet.) GOSIS: Tell me your orders! Have you made contact with the Alliance?
     (And punches him in the stomach.) GOSIS: Answer me.
     ARCHER: Our intelligence reports underestimate you, General. Alien creatures, You're even more delusional than we thought.
     This isn't a spaceship. It's suborbital. A highly experimental aircraft. We've been observing your territory for months.
     GOSIS: How did you evade our surveillance towers?
     ARCHER: It's made from a composite alloy. Invisible to any of your tracking systems.
     GOSIS: And your biological anomalies?
     REED: We've been genetically enhanced.
     GOSIS: What kind of enhancements?
     REED: Our immune systems are resistant to chemical and biological weapons, and our internal organs have been
     modified to increase cellular regeneration by thirty percent. That way, our wounds can heal more quickly.
     PELL: Create the perfect soldier.
     GOSIS: How many of you are there?
     ARCHER: We're prototypes, the only ones.
     GOSIS: And your devices, are they prototypes as well?
     ARCHER: All of them.
     GOSIS: (to guards) Take them back.
     (Reed and Archer walk out at gunpoint.)
     GOSIS: Do you believe them?
     TEMEC: It's a plausible explanation.
     PELL: The Alliance could have thousands of soldiers with these mutations.
     GOSIS: We need to verify what they've told us.
     TEMEC: I ran every imaginable test. If I were to extract the organs, I could study them in more detail.
     GOSIS: (to Pell) You'll be in charge of the execution. I'll inform the prisoners.
    
 [Bridge]
     HOSHI: Sub-Commander, another communiqué. It's from a General Gosis to the Chancellor. He said they've
     captured two enemy spies. They're going to hang them.
    
 [Launch bay - cell ship]
     TUCKER: Reconnect the diffraction relays and we'll give it another shot. (He sneaks another look under his rubber
     glove.)
     TRAVIS: Any change?
     TUCKER: Still missing in action.
     TRAVIS: Having a cloaked hand could have its advantages. Be useful in a poker match.
     TUCKER: I could probably become a world-class magician.
     TRAVIS: It might be helpful on movie night, if you bring a date. In case you want to steal some popcorn.
     TUCKER: Let's try it again. (Tucker gets out of the ship while Travis settles into the main seat.) TUCKER: Go ahead.
     (The outside of the front hatch fluctuates.)
     TRAVIS: Is it working?
     TUCKER: Not exactly. Shut her down. The cloaking generator's running at a hundred and ten percent,
     and it's still not enough. Let's route more power from the warp relays. Maybe that will do the trick.
     T'POL: How soon can you launch?
     TUCKER: We're still reconfiguring the power matrix but I'm pretty confident
     T'POL: You don't have time. They're going to be executed in less than two hours.
     TUCKER: We'll get it working on our way down if we have to. Look, invisible or not,
     this cell ship can take more of beating than our shuttlepod.
     T'POL: You're about to find out. Prepare it for launch.
    
 [Detention centre - cell]
     ARCHER: An upset stomach? Do you really think he'd fall for that?
     REED: Well, it may be an old trick where we come from, but maybe they haven't heard of it here.
     ARCHER: Even if we got out of the compound, we'd never make it to the shuttle. Not looking like this.
     Genetic enhancements. Very creative, Malcolm.
     REED: Thanks. Improvisation isn't my strong suit.
     ARCHER: You made us sound like the Suliban.
     REED: What do you suppose Enterprise will do, after we're.
     ARCHER: If I know T'Pol, she won't want to leave any contamination behind. It may take some time,
     but she'll find a way to get everything back. Including our remains.
     REED: It's ironic. Giving our lives to protect people who want to kill us.
     ARCHER: It's a big planet, Malcolm. I'm sure they're not all like that.
     REED: I'm not afraid, sir.
     ARCHER: What if we did tell them the truth?
     REED: You said it yourself, Captain. They'd never believe us.
     ARCHER: If we show them to the shuttlepod, bring the General up to Enterprise, give him the grand tour,
     top it off with dinner in the Captain's mess. We'd probably all have a good laugh over how he
     almost sent us to the gallows. I've gotten plenty of lectures on cultural contamination, but
     T'Pol never mentioned anything about sacrificing crewmen to prevent it.
     REED: If we did tell them who we are, maybe it would do them a world of good. Look what the Vulcans did for Earth.
     ARCHER: That was different. These people haven't even split the atom yet. The Vulcans waited until we were ready.
     Until we had the ability to travel to other stars. We're doing the right thing, Malcolm.
     I'm sorry you won't get a chance to write that report.
     REED: It could still happen, sir. I'm expecting a rescue party to come barging through that door any moment.
    
 [Cell ship]
     (The little cell ship launches and cloaks successfully. It's a bit crowded inside.)
     T'POL: We'll be in range of those surveillance towers in less than two minutes.
     TUCKER: They'll never see us coming.
    
 [Detention centre - cell]
     SOLDIER: On your feet.
     (Reed and Archer have their hands tied behind their backs, and they are marched out at gunpoint.)
    
 [Cell ship]
     (There's a beep and a shudder. Travis is flying the thing.)
     TRAVIS: What was that?
     TUCKER: There's a power drain in the cloaking generator.
     (The cell ship becomes visible as it reaches the cloud layer.)
     TUCKER: Are the warp relays offline?
     TRAVIS: Primary and backups.
     TUCKER: The weapon nodes are active. I thought we diverted power from the secondary systems.
     TRAVIS: We did.
     TUCKER: They may have been programmed to reactivate when we launched.
     T'POL: Three military aircraft off our port side. They're on an intercept course.(In
the detention centre courtyard, the trapdoors on the gallows have
been tested when Archer and Reed come in to see their nooses waiting.)
 [Cell ship]
     (Three bi-winged planes are shooting at the cell ship.)
     TUCKER: Travis, can't you hold this thing steady?
     TRAVIS: It'd be a lot easier if they stop firing at us.
     T'POL: Commander.
     TUCKER: Stand by.
     (The cloak gets switched back on.)
    
 [Detention centre - courtyard]
     ARCHER: He's my tactical officer. He can tell you everything you want to know about the Alliance's troop deployments,
     their weapons.
     REED: Captain.
     ARCHER: You don't need to kill him.
     (Gosis gestures with his head, and the pair are bundled up the steps to the gallows. Their necks are placed in the
     nooses with the knots by their left ears when a cloud of dust is suddenly kicked up, and a disembodied arm appears
     in midair, pointing a phase pistol. The man by the trapdoor lever gets shot first, then the other one on the gallows.
     The rest dive for cover. Tucker leaps out and heads to free Reed and Archer while T'Pol provides covering fire.
     They take cover.)
     TUCKER: Your ride's here.
     REED: Sir, the phase pistol, our equipment.
     ARCHER: Don't leave without me. (He provides the covering fire for the others to get into the cell ship and then
     dashes for the interrogation room. There's just one guard who is easily taken out. He grabs the x-rays, files and the
     equipment, and stuffs them into various handy waistcoat pockets, then heads back out and makes it into the cell ship.)
    
 [Cell ship]
     ARCHER: Let's go.
     (Gosis stares dumbfounded at the hatch closing into nothingness, and the dust as the cell ship flies off, unseen.)
     TRAVIS: The shuttlepod's right where you left it, sir. We'll be there in two minutes.
     (Archer starts frantically searching his pockets.)
     TUCKER: Captain?
     REED: Sir, looking for this? (Reed picks up the scanner from the floor.)
    
 [Ready room]
     ARCHER: Come in.
     T'POL: I scanned the region ahead. There's a blue giant cluster three light years from our current position.
     ARCHER: Any planets?
     T'POL: None that are inhabited.
     ARCHER: Sounds like a nice change of pace. Have Travis set a course.
     T'POL: Yes, sir. Was there something else? 
     ARCHER: You took a risk coming down in that cell ship. Its cloaking device could have failed.
     T'POL: A calculated risk.
     ARCHER: I'm glad you did it. What's important is that we got everything back, the communicator, the phase pistol,
     the shuttlepod. We could have done a lot of damage to those people if we'd left any of it behind.
     T'POL: We did do damage to those people.
     ARCHER: We've changed their perception of the Alliance.
T'POL: They now believe their enemy is capable of creating
genetically-enhanced soldiers, not to mention particle weapons.
     ARCHER: And thanks to that Suliban ship, they also think the Alliance has developed invisible aircraft.
     T'POL: You don't have to leave technology behind to contaminate a culture. (turns to leave) You were willing
     to sacrifice your life to protect them. I would not have expected that.
    
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox checks out Tucker's now-visible right hand.)      PHLOX: You are making excellent progress.
     TUCKER: Yeah? What about this?
     PHLOX: That's nothing.
     TUCKER: Maybe nothing to you.
     PHLOX: Give it time. Give it time.
     TUCKER: Thanks, Doc. (As he presses the button to open the doors, we see there is still a small patch on Tucker's hand
     that is cloaked.)

The Enterprise Transcripts - Singularity
Singularity
 Mission date: Aug 14, 2152
Original Airdate: 20 Nov, 2002
  (We see
the crew out cold, on the floor or slumped over their duty stations.)
T'POL [OC]: Science officer's log, August 14, 2152. Enterprise remains
on course for the trinary system. I've transmitted a distress call but
the nearest Vulcan ship is more than nine days away. By the time they
arrive, they may only find debris, if that. Even if Enterprise makes it
past the black hole without being destroyed, it seems likely the crew
won't survive.
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 T'POL: I'm continuing my analysis of the condition
that's stricken the crew. Without Doctor Phlox's assistance I'm not
hopeful about reversing its effects. I'm documenting my findings so
that Starfleet will at least have a record of what happened. The
symptoms began not long after we set a course for the trinary system.
That was nearly two days ago.
 [Situation room]
 ARCHER: You're sure it's a black hole?
T'POL: A class four.
ARCHER: According to the Vulcan star charts, your people have surveyed
more than two thousand of these things.
T'POL: That's correct, but none of them were part of a trinary star
system.
ARCHER: How close can we get?
T'POL: The gravitational shear between the stars is extreme. We'd have
to drop to impulse, but we should be able to approach to within five
million kilometres.
TUCKER: Close enough to get some nice pictures.
ARCHER: How long would it take to reach the system at impulse?
T'POL: Two days.
ARCHER: Set a course. (T'Pol leaves them.) ARCHER: Trip. If you've got some free
time, I'd love it if you take a look at my chair.
TUCKER: Sir?
ARCHER: The Captain's chair.
TUCKER: Wh-What about it?
ARCHER:: You may have noticed that I don't sit in it very much.
TUCKER: Is there a problem?
ARCHER: It's uncomfortable. When I lean back I feel like I'm about to
slide out of it. I have to sort of perch on the edge.
TUCKER: I always assumed it was the best seat in the house.
ARCHER: Take a look at it for me?
TUCKER: I was going to purge the impulse manifolds.
ARCHER: The chair first, if you don't mind.
TUCKER: Aye, aye, sir.
 [Ready room]
 (The monitor shows a portion of text about Henry
Archer, Jonathan Archer's father.)
ARCHER: Come in.
T'POL: Good morning.
ARCHER: Morning.
T'POL: Am I interrupting?
ARCHER: No, no. Just thinking about something.
T'POL: Today's duty roster. (She hands over a PADD.)
ARCHER: Thanks.
T'POL: Lieutenant Reed has a new security protocol he'd like to discuss
with you.
ARCHER: I'll drop by the Armoury. Anything else?
T'POL: Chef didn't report for duty this morning. He's ill.
ARCHER: Is it serious?
T'POL: Doctor Phlox said it's a simple virus. He should be fine after a
few days' rest. Ensign Sato has offered to take charge of the mess
hall. Apparently, she spends some of her free time in the Galley and is
eager for an opportunity to cook for the crew.
ARCHER: If it's all right with Chef. Let me ask you a question. I
received a manuscript from Earth. A biography of my father. I've been
asked to write the preface. Would you mind reading it when I'm done?
T'POL: I'd be happy to.
ARCHER: If I can ever get it finished. I've been putting it off for
weeks.
T'POL: The next two days should provide you with ample opportunity.
ARCHER: It's not that I haven't had the time. They only asked for a
page. How am I supposed to sum up my father's life in a page? It
would've been easier if they'd asked me to write the book.
T'POL: Perhaps by focusing on one incident, a single event that
exemplifies your relationship with your father, you'll be able to
condense your thoughts.
ARCHER: A logical approach. Maybe you'd like to write it for me?
T'POL: I'm hardly qualified.
 [Galley]
 CUNNINGHAM: Chef was planning to make fried
chicken tonight with scalloped potatoes and some of the Minaran spinach
we picked up on Risa.
HOSHI: The orange spinach?
CUNNINGHAM: He's convinced there's a way to make it edible.
HOSHI: Why don't we let him tackle that when he gets back? I have
something else in mind. (She calls up an oriental recipe on the monitor.)
HOSHI: It's one of my grandmother's specialties. The recipe's been passed down
for generations.
CUNNINGHAM: I'll need a translation before I can programme the protein
resequencer.
HOSHI: Oh no. You can resequence all the chicken and potatoes you want,
but I am making this from scratch.
 [Sickbay]
 (Phlox is grinding herbs with pestle and mortar when Travis enters.)
PHLOX: Ensign. Is there something I can do for you?
TRAVIS: I've got a little headache. Nothing serious.
PHLOX: Why don't you let me have a look?
TRAVIS: I was hoping you could just give me something. I'm right in the
middle of upgrading the navigation sensors.
PHLOX: It would be irresponsible to dispense medication without
examining you first. Please. Any other symptoms? Dizziness, blurred
vision?
TRAVIS: No.
PHLOX: How long have you had it?
TRAVIS: A couple of days, on and off.
PHLOX: Well, I've been meaning to have you drop by Sickbay in any
case, to see if you've had any problems since I removed the neural
implants you received at the repair station.
TRAVIS: You think it could have something to do with that?
PHLOX: Oh, I never rule out anything. Then again, it could be as
innocuous as muscular tension. On the other hand, Terrellian plague
starts out with a simple headache, then all manner of nasty things
begin to happen.
 [Bridge]
 (Tucker is using what looks like a dentist's drill
on the base of the Captain's chair, and annoying T'Pol with the noise
at the same time.)
T'POL: Commander. Commander.
TUCKER: (to his assistant) Push it forward. That's good, hold it there.
T'POL: (raising her voice) Commander. (He turns off the drill.) T'POL: Perhaps
you could finish that later.
TUCKER: This may not be as glamorous as a black hole, but the Captain
gave me an order.
T'POL: He also requested detailed sensor readings of this trinary
system.
TUCKER: I thought Vulcans had all this mental focus and discipline.
T'POL: We also have sensitive hearing. (Tucker resumes drilling and my
teeth start aching.) T'POL: I'll be in my quarters.
TUCKER: We'll let you know when we're done.
 [Armoury]
 REED: Keep those target discriminators aligned. We
don't want a torpedo mistaking one of our own nacelles for an enemy
vessel.
ARCHER: You asked to see me, Malcolm?
REED: I would have come to you, Captain.
ARCHER: It's no problem. What's on your mind?
REED: I've been reviewing our encounters with hostile species. The
crew's response has been admirable but I feel we can do better, sir.
ARCHER: And you have a proposal?
REED: I've been thinking about a ship wide emergency alert. Something a
bit more comprehensive than battle stations. We're taking far too long
to react to potential threats. With a single order from you, or an
impact to the hull, the plating could be polarised, weapons brought
online, critical systems secured.
ARCHER: I appreciate your concern, Malcolm, but this isn't a warship.
REED: That's obvious, sir. During our last run-in with the Suliban we
were unprepared for their boarding parties. When the Mazarites attacked
they disabled our aft sensors with their first shot. The list goes on.
(He hands over a PADD.)
ARCHER: I can see that. Run this by the senior officers, get some
feedback, and we'll talk again.
REED: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: And Malcolm, don't call it battle stations. Think of something
less aggressive.
 [Mess hall]
 Tthe tables are full with people eating from
bowls, using chop sticks. Hoshi is walking amongst them.)
HOSHI: How is it? (A crewwoman nods.)
REED: Condition Red?
TUCKER: (reading) Huh?
REED: What about Condition Red for the new security protocol?
TUCKER: Why don't you just call it Security Protocol?
REED: Well, that's not very dynamic.
TUCKER: Do you think a cup holder's too much?
REED: I beg your pardon?
TUCKER: For the Captain's chair. He just wanted the seat adjusted but I
figured as long as I'm working on it.
REED: Just what the captain needs in a crisis, a place to rest his
beverage.
TUCKER: I'm also upgrading the status displays. He'll be able to access
tactical data from the armrest.
REED: If you really want to improve tactical readiness, why don't you
help me with this protocol?
TUCKER: I'm a little busy right now, Malcolm.
REED: It's a chair.
TUCKER: It's the Captain's chair. It's just as important as your Reed
Alert.
REED: Reed Alert. That's not bad.
HOSHI: Enjoying your lunch?
TUCKER: Yeah. Thanks. It was terrific.
HOSHI: It's called oden. Every Japanese family has their own way of
preparing it.
TUCKER: Well, it seems to be a big hit. Congratulations.
HOSHI: Thank you. Lieutenant, you barely touched yours.
REED: It was lovely.
HOSHI: I'll get you a fresh bowl.
REED: That's not necessary.
HOSHI: It's no problem.
REED: Please. Not hungry.
HOSHI: Are you sure there's nothing wrong with it?
REED: Well it was a bit salty.
HOSHI: Salty? (She takes a sip.) HOSHI: It tastes fine.
REED: Well, it just must be me, then. Everybody else seems to be
enjoying it. (The pair get up to leave, still intent on their PADDs.)
 [Sickbay]
 (Travis is lying on the gurney that goes into the
body scanner.)
TRAVIS: How much longer is this going to take?
PHLOX: That depends.
TRAVIS: On what?
PHLOX: Hold still, Ensign.
TRAVIS: I have to get back to the Bridge.
PHLOX: I'm afraid you won't be returning to duty today.
TRAVIS: The Captain needs those upgrades, Doctor.
PHLOX: When it comes to medical matters my authority overrides the
Captain's. I'm keeping you overnight for observation.
TRAVIS: But your scans didn't show anything.
PHLOX: That's what concerns me. Whatever's afflicting you may be laying
dormant. I'm going to run a full biomolecular scan to see if we can
find where it's hiding. Now, lie back and don't move.
 [Archer's quarters]
 (He is dictating his preface, and the computer is
putting it up on screen, including punctuation.)
ARCHER: When I was about eight years old, my father took me on a tour
of the Warp Five facility outside of Bozeman, Montana. He introduced me
to the people he worked with. Scientists with names like Tasaki and
Cochrane. At the time, I didn't realise the significance of those names
or the significance of my father's work. (Porthos barks) Computer,
pause. I'll feed you in a minute. Computer, resume recording. In a way,
creating a stable warp field mirrored the, the flux of emotions my
father felt when he embarked on. Computer, pause. Delete the last
paragraph. Hell, delete the whole thing. (Porthos barks again) Quiet.
(The little dog goes to his cushion and sulks.)
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 T'POL: Come in.
TUCKER: Here's your sensor interface. What's the emergency?
T'POL: This trinary system is emitting some unusual radiation. I'm
trying to identify it.
TUCKER: You dragged me up here so you could identify radiation?
T'POL: Correct.
TUCKER: You said it was urgent.
T'POL: I said it was important.
TUCKER: I get it. You're paying me back. Making me jump through hoops
because I was making too much noise. Well, you'll be happy to know I
moved the Captain's chair down to Engineering. So it's nice and quiet
on the Bridge now.
T'POL: I prefer to work here. I'll need your assistance with this.
TUCKER: Weren't you listening to me? I don't have time to cater to your
whims. You want to get your name immortalized in the Vulcan database,
get someone else to help you do it.
T'POL: Are you feeling all right, Commander?
TUCKER: I know you don't think this chair is important, but you're
wrong. What's the most critical component on this ship? The main
computer? The warp reactor? Uh-uh, it's the crew. And the most
important member of the crew is the Captain. He makes life and death
decisions every day and the last thing he needs to be thinking in a
critical situation is, 'Gee, I wish this chair wasn't such a pain in
the ass.'
 [Sickbay]
 TRAVIS: Doctor? (Phlox is staring intently at the body scanner monitor.)
PHLOX: Shush.
TRAVIS: When are you going to
PHLOX: Wait!
TRAVIS: I have just enough time to shower and get changed.
PHLOX: I haven't discharged you, Ensign.
TRAVIS: I haven't slept all night and I'm supposed to go on duty in
fifteen minutes.
PHLOX: I need to perform a cerebral micro-section.
TRAVIS: A what?
PHLOX: Lie down.
TRAVIS: No more tests. I have to get to the Bridge. (Phlox blocks his way.)
PHLOX: I'm giving you an order.
TRAVIS: If I don't finish those upgrades, I could get a reprimand.
It'll be in my permanent record.
PHLOX: You have far more to worry about than a blemish on your record.
Do you see there? Your cortical scan shows elevated levels of serotonin
and several other neurotransmitters.
TRAVIS: What does that mean?
PHLOX: I'll let you know once I've completed the micro-section.
TRAVIS: Can't it wait until after my shift?
PHLOX: Absolutely not.
TRAVIS: If the Captain doesn't think I can handle my duties, I'll be
scrubbing plasma conduits on D Deck for the next five years. I could be
court-martialed.
PHLOX: And what if you're carrying a protocystian spore, and you infect
the rest of the crew? How will that reflect on you? Or what if you
suddenly suffer a seizure at the helm because you've contracted
Andronesian encephalitis? Now there is something wrong with you,
Ensign, and I intend to find out what it is.
TRAVIS: Not today. Not during my shift. Unless you're ready to tie me
to a biobed, I'm going back to my helm.
PHLOX: At least let me give you an analgesic for the headache.
TRAVIS: That's all I wanted in the first place.
PHLOX: If it gets any worse, or you suffer any other symptoms, return
here immediately.
(Travis nods, Phlox injects him and then -)
TRAVIS: What did you (Travis passes out.)
 [Engineering]
 (Trip is working on the Captain's chair when
Malcolm bursts in.)
REED: I've been working on the new security protocol. Obviously, the
reactor must be secured immediately during a Tactical Alert.
TUCKER: Tactical Alert?
REED: I considered your suggestion, Reed Alert, but it seemed a bit
narcissistic.
TUCKER: Hand me that hyperspanner, would you?
REED: I've also been working on a new alert signal. Tell me what you
think. (a klaxon) Or this one? (more like a buzzer) Well, which do you
prefer?
TUCKER: For what?
REED: A Tactical Alert.
TUCKER: They both sound like a bag full of cats.
REED: Well, they were designed to get your attention. (He takes the PADD off Reed and puts it on a shelf.)
TUCKER: I'll look
this over and get back to you. (Reed picks it up again.)
REED: I also need your help on an emergency
shutdown procedure for the EPS grid.
TUCKER: I said I'll get back to you.
REED: Fine. Let's hope we don't suffer a catastrophic reactor breach in
the meantime.
TUCKER: Malcolm. One of your boys borrowed my laser micrometer. If
you're heading to the Armoury, could you get it back for me?
 [Galley]
 CUNNINGHAM: Ensign, if we don't serve something
soon we're going to have a riot on our hands.
HOSHI: Is this too salty? Something's not right. Hand me the Kreetassan
spice. I'll add it to the stock. Oh, I'm out of carrots.
CUNNINGHAM: There are twenty five people
HOSHI: Carrots!
CUNNINGHAM: (bringing the carrots) With all due respect, you've been
cooking the same meal over and over again.
HOSHI: I believe I'm in charge of the galley.
CUNNINGHAM: I understand
HOSHI: You're relieved.
CUNNINGHAM: Ma'am.
HOSHI: Get out!
 [Armoury]
 T'POL: Lieutenant, I need your
REED: Clearance code.
T'POL: I beg your pardon?
REED: What is your clearance code? The Armoury is a restricted area.
T'POL: Even to the First Officer?
REED: How do I know you are the First Officer? We've encountered
species that can alter their appearance. They could masquerade as any
one of us. I've issued codes to all senior officers to reveal if the
ship's been infiltrated by impostors.
T'POL: Part of your new security protocol?
REED: It was sent to your console as a voice-encrypted command packet.
T'POL: I haven't been to the Bridge for several hours. As I was saying,
I need assistance establishing a sensor interface in my quarters. I've
asked Commander Tucker, but he became agitated. It was
uncharacteristic, even for him. Have you noticed anything abnormal
about his behaviour?
REED: Why do you want to access the sensor array from your quarters?
T'POL: I was asked to run detailed scans of the trinary star system.
REED: I wasn't informed.
T'POL: It isn't a tactical issue. Lieutenant, why are you armed?
REED: From now on, security personnel are to wear side arms in all
restricted areas.
T'POL: Have you cleared this with the Captain?
REED: It's in my proposal.
T'POL: Has he approved your proposal?
REED: I've been trying to get him to pay closer attention to security
since we left spacedock, but he's more interested in fraternising with
the crew. Inviting them to breakfast, and to watch water polo. I intend
to implement some long-overdue changes, and if the Captain won't
approve them then I'll go directly to Starfleet Command. Was there
anything else?
T'POL: No.
 [T'Pol's quarters}
 (Continuing the dictation from the start of the
story.)
T'POL: It wasn't long before I realized the odd behaviour wasn't
limited to Commander Tucker. In fact, everyone I encountered was acting
strangely, growing consumed with matters that seemed trivial at best. I
also discovered that although I appeared to be immune, the Captain was
not.
 [Engineering]
 (Archer enters, gazing at the PADD he's writing
the book preface on.)
ARCHER: What happened to my chair?
TUCKER: Did you know that this chair is the exact same model used on
Neptune class survey ships?
ARCHER: Is that why you called me down here?
TUCKER: Enterprise is the first warp five vessel in human history, the
pride of the fleet, and you're sitting in a chair they've been using on
warp two ships for over a decade. You deserve better, so I'm starting
from scratch. I'm going to build you a throne. Stand right there. I
need to get a few parametric scans to get your exact dimensions. This
baby is going to fit like a glove. (Archer backs away from the thing Trip is pointing at him.)
ARCHER: Isn't
that used for aligning phase coils?
TUCKER: You won't feel a thing. (Trip takes his scan.)
ARCHER: As long as I'm down here, maybe I
can get your opinion.
TUCKER: Don't move.
ARCHER: (reading from PADD) How does one measure a man's legacy? Is it
defined by the works he's created, the technological advances that will
forever alter the course of human history?
TUCKER: Turn around.
ARCHER: If so, then no man since Zephram Cochrane, himself has made a
more lasting contribution to the future of humankind than my father,
Doctor Henry Archer.
TUCKER: All done.
ARCHER: What do you think?
TUCKER: Sounds good.
ARCHER: Let me read you the rest. (Tucker is intent on the scan results on his monitor.)
TUCKER: I really need to
get to work on this.
ARCHER: It's just a few more pages.
TUCKER: How many more?
ARCHER: Nineteen.
TUCKER: Nineteen? Are you writing the preface or the book?
ARCHER: I've got a lot to say.
TUCKER: No kidding.
ARCHER: What's that supposed to mean?
TUCKER: If I may, sir, it's a little longwinded.
ARCHER: You're lucky you're a decent engineer because you obviously
don't know anything about writing.
TUCKER: I'm not the only one. (Archer storms out.)
 [Galley]
 HOSHI: I have eighty three people to feed, not
just senior officers.
T'POL: All I requested was a bowl of Plomeek broth.
HOSHI: I don't have time for special orders. Anyway, you'll like this
better.
ARCHER: Where's lunch?
HOSHI: It'll be ready in one minute, sir.
ARCHER: I don't have a minute.
HOSHI: If you're so hungry, fix yourself a sandwich.
T'POL: Captain? May I speak with you? (Archer takes the pot of oden off the stove and starts to
help himself.)
HOSHI: That is a very complex recipe. I will not serve it till
it's just right. My family's reputation is at stake.
(Then the klaxon goes off)
REED [OC]: This is a Tactical Alert. All hands report to your stations.
I repeat, this is a Tactical Alert.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Report! (Reed stands with his arms folded, shaking his head.)
REED: The crew's response was
unacceptable. Thirty eight percent of them failed to report to their
stations. Critical systems haven't been secured. I haven't even heard
from Engineering.
ARCHER: Shut off that damn noise. Shut it off. I don't recall
authorising a tactical drill.
REED: It wouldn't be much of a drill if everybody knew about it, sir.
One minute and fifteen seconds.
ARCHER: What?
REED: It took you one minute and fifteen seconds to reach your post.
I'd expect more of our Commanding Officer given that the crew just
might follow his example.
TUCKER: Captain.
REED: One minute and forty nine seconds.
TUCKER: You might want to see this, sir.
(he leads them back to the )
 [Situation room]
 (Where he calls up the plans for the new Captain's
chair on the central display.)
TUCKER: Interactive status displays, secondary helm control. It's even
got inertial micro-dampers. The ship could be shaking apart and you'd
hardly feel a thing.
REED: You ignored a tactical alert for this?
TUCKER: I want to run some colours by you for the headrest.
REED: This is all a big joke to you.
TUCKER: Give it a rest.
REED: This isn't a bloody pleasure cruise. Without proper discipline on
this ship, this mission is doomed.
TUCKER: Why don't you go play soldier somewhere else?
(Archer becomes engrossed in his preface again.)
REED: If this were a military situation you'd be taken out and shot.
(Tucker grabs Reed and pushes him up against the bulkhead. Archer has
to break them up.)
ARCHER: Hey, hey, hey, hey. (He shoves Tucker against the bulkhead himself.)
ARCHER: I don't care what colour the headrest is, or whether it can serve me
iced tea. I just want a place to sit when I'm on duty. (Then he does the
same to Reed.) ARCHER: And if I hear that alarm one more time I may have you
taken out and shot. (to T'Pol) Unless there's a real emergency, like a
reactor breach, I don't want to be disturbed.
 [Archer's quarters]
 (He is barefoot and slumped in a corner when the
doorbell chimes.)
ARCHER: Go away. (T'Pol comes in anyway.) ARCHER: Do I have to start locking my
door?
T'POL: You said to interrupt you if there was an emergency. I believe
there is.
ARCHER: Is that right? (he goes over to the monitor, which shows the words
he read to Tucker earlier.)
T'POL: The crew's behaviour has become erratic. Even by human
standards, they've grown distracted. Everyone I've encountered appears
to be preoccupied with trivial matters. Ensign Sato's recipe, for
example. Your preface. We should declare a medical emergency and have
Doctor Phlox examine the crew. I suggest he begin with you.
ARCHER: I'm busy.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: Dismissed.
T'POL: Your crew is in danger.
ARCHER: I gave you an order.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: I suggest you follow it, or I'll have you confined to your
quarters, until, until a Vulcan ship can come and get you. (He manhandles
her out of the room.)
 [Sickbay]
 (Phlox is in full latex surgery gear, with Travis
strapped to a table.)
PHLOX: You're just in time, Sub-Commander. There's a surgical gown in
the compartment by the microscope. This is a rare opportunity to
explore the human brain.
T'POL: Was he injured?
PHLOX: A headache. At first, I thought it was a simple vascular
dilation but then I discovered a chemical imbalance in his prefrontal
cortex. I'm going to begin by extracting the first twelve millimetres
of his parietal lobe. A sub-cellular analysis of the tissue should shed
some light on the mystery.
T'POL: Doctor, you may want to delay the procedure. We have a larger
problem. The entire crew is ill.
PHLOX: They'll have to wait. (T'Pol stops him from cutting into Travis's head.)
T'POL: You've been
affected, as well.
PHLOX: Please remove your hand. (He moves his fingers so the laser scalpel
is pointing at her eye.) PHLOX: I won't ask you again. (she lets go) I'll let
you know when I've completed the surgery.
(T'Pol administers a quick neck pinch and he crumples to the floor, then she goes to
study Travis's brain scans.)
 [Galley]
 (T'Pol uses a medical scanner to check Hoshi's
brain.)
T'POL [OC]: The crew's bio-signs were growing erratic. I began to doubt
any of them would survive more than a few hours.
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 T'POL: (continuing to dictate her log) Ironically,
Dr. Phlox's obsession with Ensign Mayweather's headache has provided
some useful data. His cerebral scans have helped me determine that the
radiation coming from the trinary system is causing (a computer alert
sounds) Computer, pause. (A scan of the star's radiation fields comes
up.) T'POL: Computer, resume log. My radiometric analysis is complete. As I
suspected, reversing course won't take us out of danger quickly enough.
The radiation appears to extend outward at least half a light year in
every direction except one. If I can chart a course between the stars
we could escape the radiation before the crew succumbs. But I won't be
able to pilot the ship alone.
 [Archer's quarters]
 (Archer is slumped over his desk.)
T'POL: Captain? Captain Archer! You're needed on the Bridge.
ARCHER: I told you not to disturb me. (T'Pol hauls him to his feet.)
T'POL: We have very little time.
ARCHER: What are you doing?
T'POL: Your crew may be dying.
ARCHER: What?
T'POL: Do you remember that trinary star system?
ARCHER: The one with the black hole?
T'POL: It's emitting a dangerous form of radiation. It's affecting your
prefrontal cortex. (She gets him into his shower cubicle.) T'POL: I believe that's
why you and the crew have been exhibiting obsessive behaviour. Some of
the crew's biosigns are already unstable. If you're exposed to the
radiation much longer you won't survive. (She props him against the wall,
gets out and turns on the cold water.) T'POL: Do you understand what I'm
telling you?
ARCHER: Turn it off.
T'POL: Do you understand?
ARCHER: Yes. Radiation. Tell Phlox, if the the crew's sick. Tell Phlox.
T'POL: He's been affected as well.
ARCHER: But not you?
T'POL: Vulcan physiology seems to be immune.
ARCHER: Bring us about. Turn the ship around.
(She turns the water off and gets him a towel.)
T'POL: It's not that simple. If we go back the way we came we'll spend
two more days in the radiation field. I've charted a course that'll
have us clear of the radiation in less than seventeen minutes.
(T'Pol pours him coffee from a thermos that was on his desk.)
ARCHER: Lousy coffee.
T'POL: But we'll have to pass within two million kilometres of the
black hole. There's considerable debris and gravitational shear.
Someone needs to pilot Enterprise while I determine the course
corrections.
ARCHER: Travis.
T'POL: He's been sedated.
ARCHER: I'm in no condition to fly a starship.
T'POL: We have no other choice.
 [Bridge]
 (Enterprise sails serenely through gas and
boulders as Reed sleeps at his post.)
T'POL: More gravitational shear. We're too far to port.
ARCHER: (at the helm) But you said bearing two point four.
T'POL: Twelve point four.
ARCHER: My mistake. Twelve point four. (There's a lot of juddering
feedback from the joystick.) ARCHER: How much longer is this going to take?
T'POL: Six minutes.
ARCHER: I'm good for that.
T'POL: Another shear front. We need to rotate our longitudinal axis by
twelve degrees and bring our flight vector to zero one four mark two
seven.
ARCHER: Hold on, hold on. Zero what?
T'POL: Zero one four mark.
ARCHER: Mark two-seven.
(The hull echoes as boulders bounce off it.)
T'POL: Just minor debris. The hull plating is holding. Our lateral
vector is drifting. Captain!
ARCHER: Hang on a second. I feel like I'm in flight school again.
T'POL: You're doing well. New heading. Zero zero six mark four. (A huge
lump of rock drifts into their path.) T'POL: Captain!
ARCHER: I see it. (The rock shatters as they approach.) ARCHER: We need phase
cannons.
T'POL: They'd take too long to charge. (A big hit, and the alert klaxon
sounds.) T'POL: All weapons are online. It must be part of the new security
protocol.
ARCHER: Fire! (Two shots clear their path of danger.) ARCHER: Could you shut
that off? (The klaxon stops.) ARCHEHR: How much longer?
T'POL: Less than ten seconds. Five more seconds.
(They clear the gas cloud and are in open black, starlit space again.)
ARCHER: Any more surprises?
T'POL: Nothing on sensors. (Tucker wakes and gets up off the floor.)
TUCKER: Did we get some nice
pictures of the black hole?
 [Sickbay]
 (Phlox is checking out the crew for residual
effects.)
PHLOX: How are you feeling?
TRAVIS: A little tired, but the headache's gone. What'd you do?
PHLOX: Very little, fortunately. You're free to go.
(Archer and T'Pol enter.)
TRAVIS: Captain. (Travis leaves.)
ARCHER: How's the crew?
PHLOX: Oh, I'm continuing to monitor vital signs. But I've detected no
lingering effects from the radiation. Mostly just rattled nerves, a few
bruises and sprains from when some of them lost consciousness. I
appreciate your intervening before I got any further with Mister
Mayweather's procedure.
T'POL: I wasn't certain it would work on a Denobulan.
PHLOX: It worked quite effectively, I can assure you.
ARCHER: What procedure on Mister Mayweather?
PHLOX: The radiation affected my nervous system rather severely. (More
crewmembers enter.) PHLOX: I'll be with you in a moment. I'll provide you with
a full report when I've finished treating the crew.
 [Ready room]
 REED: You wanted to see me, Captain?
ARCHER: I did. When T'Pol and I were navigating the debris field your
Tactical Alert went off.
REED: I heard, sir. I've already deactivated the new protocols.
ARCHER: You shouldn't have. They brought the weapons online right when
we needed them. If you have no objection I'd like to make it standard
procedure.
REED: No objection, sir.
ARCHER: You still need to work on that alarm.
REED: I'll get right on it. 
 [Bridge]
 (Trip has just finished putting the Captain's
chair back in its place>)
ARCHER: It doesn't look any different to me.
TUCKER: Give it a try. (Archer sits and pauses.)
ARCHER: It feels better. What'd you do?
TUCKER: Cross your legs.
ARCHER: What did you do? It seems totally different.
TUCKER: I lowered it, by one centimetre.
ARCHER: That's all?
TUCKER: Didn't have time to install the new status displays or the
inertial micro-dampers, but if you give me a couple of days.
ARCHER: I think this'll be fine, Commander. Thanks.
TUCKER: How about I just attach the cup holder?
ARCHER: This'll be fine.
(Tucker leaves, giving a thumbs up to Archer, which is returned. After a
couple of moments, Archer gets up and goes over to T'Pol with his PADD.)
ARCHER: How does this sound?

Vanishing
Point
 Original Airdate: 27 Nov, 2002
  [Planet
surface]
 (Hoshi and Tucker are making a photographic record
of paintings, carvings and pictograms on old stone ruins/)
HOSHI: These are at least three hundred years older than the ones in
the last chamber.
TUCKER: You sure you can't read any of this?
HOSHI: No. How about you?
TUCKER: Well, I think this says tall guys are popular.
HOSHI: You're a budding linguist. Let's get a shot of that one.(A
relief carving of a face.) HOSHI: I wonder what happened to them.
TUCKER: It is kind of weird. Not a single biosign on the entire planet.
(comm. beep) Tucker.
ARCHER [OC}: You about finished down there, Trip?
TUCKER: You can't believe these ruins, sir. We've been through two
dozen chambers. No telling
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER [OC]: How many more there are.
ARCHER: I'm afraid you're not going to find out today. That storm we
told you about hasn't changed course.
 [Planet surface]
 ARCHER [OC]: You and Hoshi are going to need to
get back to Enterprise.
TUCKER: We'll just finish up with Mister Tall and Popular. We should
back to the shuttlepod in five, six minutes.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Don't take any longer than that. Archer
out. (T'Pol is at the situation room console.)
T'POL: Captain? We have another storm.
ARCHER: Another one? [Situation room](He joins her.)
T'POL: The discharges are more intense.
ARCHER: It's a good deal bigger.
T'POL: And stronger. It's pushing the first storm through these
mountains at twice the speed it was moving a few minutes ago.
REED: They're diamagnetic storms, Captain, saturated with polaric
energy.
ARCHER: This is the shuttle?
T'POL: Less than ten kilometres from the first storm.
 {Planet surface] (A driving
wind, and thick black storm clouds and twisters coming over the
mountains.)
ARCHER [OC]: You may not be able to see yet, but it'll be coming
through the mountain pass to the north.
TUCKER: We can see it just fine, Captain.
 [Situation room]
 ARCHER: The storms are throwing up too much
interference into the atmosphere. The shuttle's out of the question.
 [Planet surface]
 HOSHI: Captain, these ruins have very thick walls.
I'm sure we'll be safe inside.
 [Situation room]
 ARCHER: I'm afraid we're not talking about
thunderclouds, Hoshi. A polaric burst that could short-circuit a
shuttlepod could do a lot worse to your nervous system.
HOSHI [OC]: But sir, these buildings are
 [Planet surface]
 HOSHI: Over four thousand years old. I'm sure
they've survived hundreds of these storms.
 [Situation room]
 ARCHER: I've sent Malcolm down to the transporter.
We're going to need to bring you up
 [Planet surface]
 ARCHER [OC]: One at a time.
HOSHI: Couldn't we wait it out inside the shuttle? Polarise the hull
plating.
 [Situation room]
 T'POL: That would most likely attract the polaric
discharge.
ARCHER: You have to do this, Hoshi.
 [Planet surface]
 ARCHER [OC]: There's no choice. I'll need you
clear of the structure
 [Situation room]
 ARCHER: One at a time.
 [Planet surface]
 TUCKER: Understood, Captain. Ladies first.
HOSHI: Have you ever done this?
TUCKER: No, but the Captain has, and Malcolm did it twice. They said
there's nothing to it.
HOSHI: Your molecules get pulled apart.
TUCKER: Then they get put back together again.
HOSHI: Do you know how many molecules you're made up of?
TUCKER: Lots.
HOSHI: All right, how many?
TUCKER: A few trillion.
HOSHI: That's a pretty big jigsaw puzzle. What if some other pieces get
put in the wrong place? You know, I bet a lot of them look real
similar.
TUCKER: Starfleet said it's safe. That's good enough for me.
HOSHI: Okay, okay, but you go first and if you get to Enterprise in one
piece I'll be right behind you.
TUCKER: Fair enough. Tucker to Enterprise.
REED [OC]: I read you, Commander.
TUCKER: Ready to go. (He's beamed away.)
HOSHI: (into communicator) Commander?
TUCKER [OC]: Safe and sound.
HOSHI: I'm on my way, sir. (She picks up a case and dashes into the open.)
HOSHI: Ensign Sato ready for transport.
 [Transporter alcove]
 REED: Welcome to the club.
TUCKER: How do those molecules feel? All in the right place?
HOSHI: I'll let you know.
 [Hoshi's quarters]
 (She's washing her face and examining very closely
when the door bell chimes.)
HOSHI: Come in. (Archer stays on the threshold.)
ARCHER: No worse for the wear, Ensign?
HOSHI: I guess you could say that, sir. I'll be at my post in a few
minutes. I just want to clean up and change.
ARCHER: I think you've had enough excitement for one afternoon. The
morning'll be fine.
HOSHI: Thank you.
ARCHER: I assume you and Trip will want to finish your survey tomorrow,
weather permitting.
HOSHI: Sir?
ARCHER: You left a shuttlepod down there, remember? Somebody's got to
go back and get it.
HOSHI: I'm sure Commander Tucker can find someone else to hold the
second flash unit.
ARCHER: You wouldn't be using the transporter, Hoshi. You'd be taking
the other pod.
HOSHI: I don't want to get lost.
ARCHER: Lost?
HOSHI: Too much excitement for one day. I could really use some rest,
sir.
ARCHER: See you in the morning.
(He closes the door, and she returns to examining every pore on her
face.)
 [Mess hall]
 REED: So he tells her it was merely a warp
imbalance.
TUCKER: That's a lie, Malcolm.
REED: We all heard it, Commander. There's no use pretending.
TUCKER: Come on, Travis.
HOSHI: Anyone sitting here?
TUCKER: Don't you think a Vulcan would see right through this one?
TRAVIS: But that's what you said, though.
HOSHI: Is anyone sitting here?
TUCKER: No, please. (she puts her tray down and sits)
TRAVIS: So, what was it like?
REED: Travis, let her eat her supper.
HOSHI: It was very unsettling. Didn't you find it unsettling?
TUCKER: For a minute or two, but once I counted my fingers and toes.
HOSHI: I don't know. I just don't feel right.
TUCKER: It was probably that storm. You don't forget things like that
too quickly.
HOSHI: Not the storms, it's the transporter. I don't feel like myself
since I went through it. I need to check the medical database and find
out what happened to people they used when they were testing that
thing.
REED: You mean other than Cyrus Ramsey?
HOSHI: Cyrus Ramsey?
TUCKER: Don't tell me you don't know about poor Cyrus.
HOSHI: Am I supposed to?
TRAVIS: You can't go on a survival overnight without hearing a story
about someone seeing Ramsey's molecules rematerialising on a foggy
night.
HOSHI: What happened to him?
TUCKER: Next thing you'll tell us you never heard of the Easter bunny.
HOSHI: What happened to him?
TUCKER: Madison, Wisconsin, May, I think, 2146. He was a test subject
for the first long-range transport. Just one hundred metres. Something
went wrong with the pattern buffer. He never rematerialised.
REED: Come on, Hoshi, everybody's heard of Cyrus Ramsey.
HOSHI: I must have fallen asleep before the ghost stories.
TUCKER: Where'd you do your survival training?
TRAVIS: Death Valley, California. Middle of July, naturally. You?
TUCKER: Captain and I were in the same group. Alice Springs, Australia.
Never saw so many flies in my life. Biting kind. (comm., chirps)
Tucker.
ARCHER [OC]: The storms are breaking up. I don't think we'll have any
trouble getting you back down in the morning.
TUCKER: Travis was just telling me he'd like to see the ruins.
ARCHER [OC]: Well, I don't think Hoshi will be joining you.
TUCKER: I'll need a pilot to bring the other pod back.
ARCHER [OC]: Travis it is. I'll see you both in the morning. Archer
out.
TUCKER: Never say I don't take you anywhere.
TRAVIS: You don't take me anywhere.
(All the men get up and leave.)
HOSHI: See you later.
 [Sickbay]
 HOSHI: Doctor? Doctor Phlox.
Hello? (Suddenly he's behind her.)
PHLOX: Ensign. Something I can do for you?
HOSHI: I just looked in there. Were you in there? Did you hear me come
in?
PHLOX: I was feeding my leeches. Are you all right?
HOSHI: You didn't hear me?
PHLOX: I'm right here, Ensign. Are you not feeling well?
HOSHI: No, I'm not feeling well. I dematerialised, and then I
rematerialised and, no, I'm not feeling well.
PHLOX: I heard about your ordeal on the surface. Those storms sounded
terrifying.
HOSHI: Doctor, I'm not talking about the storms. I'm talking about my
molecules.
PHLOX: Come sit down. Let's take a look. (He begins scanning her.) PHLOX: It'll
take me a while to account for every molecule, but you appear to be in
one piece. I don't think you're in danger of becoming the next Cyrus
Ramsey.
HOSHI: Don't tell me they talk about him on Denobula.
PHLOX: I spent nearly nine months on Earth, remember?
HOSHI: I just don't feel right. Ever since the transport, I've been
shaky, not myself.
PHLOX: Not a single bio-molecular anomaly.
HOSHI: No? How about this? (She indicates a mark by her nose.)
PHLOX: A subcutaneous pigmentation.
HOSHI: It's not where it used to be. It was a good centimetre lower.
PHLOX: Well, it looks lovely where it is now.
HOSHI: It's not a joke, Doctor. If that machine could move a birthmark,
who knows what else it could do. I'm telling you, I don't feel right.
PHLOX: I have a lot of animals to feed before bedtime. If I were you,
I'd get a good night's sleep, hmm?
 [Hoshi's quarters]
 (She's wakened by a comm. chirp.)
HOSHI: Hello?
T'POL [OC]: You're needed on the Bridge, Ensign.
HOSHI: What time is it?
T'POL [OC]: Eleven hundred hours. There's been an emergency.
HOSHI: Eleven hundred hours, that's impossible. My shift starts at oh
eight hundred.
T'POL [OC]: Now, Ensign.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: I'm sorry, Captain, I don't know what
happened.
ARCHER: Tucker and Mayweather have been taken hostage. Trip got a short
message but we haven't heard anything in the last hour.
HOSHI: Taken hostage by who?
ARCHER: The people down there didn't like you disturbing their ruins.
HOSHI: People? There wasn't a biosign on the planet.
T'POL: The chambers you and Mister Tucker photographed contained sacred
relics.
HOSHI: How could you possibly know that?
ARCHER: Have you found their biosigns?
REED: They're still in the complex. I'm trying to isolate the specific
chamber.
HOSHI: (comm. beep) It's Mayweather's communicator.
ARCHER: Go ahead, Travis.
ALIEN [OC]: (something)
ARCHER: Ensign?
HOSHI: I need more.
ARCHER: This is Captain Archer of the Starship Enterprise. We apologise
if we've trespassed. My crewmen didn't mean any harm.
ALIEN [OC]: (something)
HOSHI: I'm sorry, sir, it's not working. I'm going to need more.
ARCHER: Can I speak to one of my officers?
ALIEN [OC]: (something increasingly belligerent)
ARCHER: It's not going to get much better than that.
T'POL: What's the problem?
REED: Maybe you should forget about the UT. Just try and talk to them.
HOSHI: Ajas sukas.
ALIEN [OC]: (something)
HOSHI: Tag zra uras turana.
ALIEN [OC]: (something)
HOSHI: If I went back to the universal translator, maybe I could
ARCHER: You already tried that. Talk to them.
HOSHI: I can't.
T'POL: Lives are at stake, Ensign.
HOSHI: I know. I don't understand what he's saying. I'm, I'm sorry. I'm
sorry.
ARCHER: No need to apologise. Why don't you go back to your quarters
and get some rest.
HOSHI: Captain, I realise I overslept. I don't know how it happened,
but please, I don't want to go back to my quarters.
ARCHER: (to Baird) Take the comm.
BAIRD: Aye, Captain.
ARCHER: Malcolm.
(Archer and Reed leave the Bridge. Then Hoshi walks out too. In her bathroom, she starts to run a shower and
looks in the mirror. For a moment she thinks her reflection has
vanished. In the shower itself, she sees the water running straight
through her hands)
 [Mess hall]
 HOSHI: Anyone sitting here? Sub-commander? (T'Pol finally looks up from her book.)
T'POL: Ensign. Would you like to
join me?
HOSHI: Thank you. I would've thought you'd be on the Bridge.
T'POL: Why is that?
HOSHI: Commander Tucker. Travis.
T'POL: The hostage situation was resolved. They're back on board.
HOSHI: It's only been an hour since I left the Bridge. What happened?
T'POL: Crewman Baird deciphered their language. A simple bimodal
syntax.
HOSHI: I don't understand. How?
T'POL: With the universal translator.
HOSHI: That's impossible. I ran every linguistic algorithm.
T'POL: When the Captain agreed to return the soil and rock samples, and
destroy the photographs that were taken, the hostages were released.
HOSHI: If we've decrypted their language, I should get back to the
Bridge. It sounds like the Captain might want to speak with them again.
T'POL: Captain Archer has asked that you remain off duty for the time
being. Crewman Baird has been placed in charge of communications.
 [Corridor]
 ALISON: (to crewman) After lunch, you should take
a look at the secondary couplings. They're going to need to be aligned.
HOSHI: Alison. (She gets totally blanked.)
ALISON: Start on C deck, then work your way down.
CREWMAN: Yes ma'am.
(Hoshi comes to the turbolift as another woman steps out. She enters
and tries to shut the doors, but they don't respond. Then she hears
voices.) REED [OC]: The stream's too unstable.
TUCKER [OC]: Come on, Hoshi.
HOSHI: What?
REED [OC]: You can do it, Ensign. It's as easy as one, two,
(A crewman steps into the turbolift and activates it.)
 [Sickbay]
 HOSHI: Can you see me?
PHLOX: Ensign?
HOSHI: Can you see me?
PHLOX: Is there something in particular you'd like me to look at?
HOSHI: Something's wrong, Doctor. Something's very wrong. Ever since I
used that transporter nothing has been the way that it's supposed to
be. I couldn't translate a simple, bi-modal syntax, but Crewman Baird
could. Crewman Baird doesn't know the first thing about our linguistic
database. And Captain Archer told me to stay in my quarters, but my
mirror doesn't want to give me a solid reflection and my shower can't
decide whether to bounce off me or go through me. Nobody wants to talk
to me. Sometimes I think they don't even see that I'm there. The
turbolift control won't even respond to me.
PHLOX: Well, I see you, Ensign, and the Sickbay doors responded when
you came in. Transporter technology is very new. (scans her) I'm sure
humans were equally frightened when the automobile was introduced, or
the airplane. New forms of transport take a while to get used to. I'm
not at all surprised at your reaction. You wouldn't catch me using that
apparatus. But I can promise you one thing. You're in perfect health.
You're neither transparent nor porous.
HOSHI: You won't put this on my medical record, will you?
PHLOX: As far as I'm concerned I didn't even see you come in here.
HOSHI: Not funny, Doctor.
PHLOX: I would like to give you a mild sedative. It'll help you get a
good night's sleep.
HOSHI: If it's all the same to you the last thing I need right now is
to be medicated.
PHLOX: As you wish, but stop by in the morning, all right?
HOSHI: First thing. Thank you, Doctor.
(the door control responds to her touch, and she smiles)
 [Gymnasium]
 (Trip is using the 360 degree ball contraption,
presumably something to do with weightless training.)
TUCKER: You're upside down, Ensign.
HOSHI: I was taught never to contradict a superior officer. The Captain
told me what happened. Did they treat you all right?
TUCKER: Didn't even tie us up. As soon as the Captain promised to give
them their stuff back they walked us to the shuttlepods and away we
went.
HOSHI: I'm sorry I wasn't more helpful trying to translate. I don't
know what happened.
TUCKER: Well, we're safe and sound. That's all that matters. Have you
tried this thing?
HOSHI: I get motion sickness, remember? Have you felt okay since we
were transported yesterday?
TUCKER: Considering that I've been back down to the surface, kidnapped
and released, I've probably had better days. Why, are you not feeling
well? (Hoshi is working her arms and shoulders with a resistance apparatus.)
HOSHI: I
didn't think I was, but the doctor seems to feel my symptoms are
psychological.
TUCKER: What kind of symptoms?
HOSHI: I just haven't been myself. Everything's a little off ,even the
laws of physics.
TUCKER: Well, in that case, you're right. You shouldn't get on this
thing. The laws of physics don't apply in here, either. Sorry. Just
trying to cheer you up.
HOSHI: It's okay. Phlox promises me I'll be fine. (Tucker gets out of the ball thing.)
TUCKER: It's going to be a while before
any of us gets used to being taken apart and put back together again.
It seems perfectly natural to be anxious about it. (Hoshi works her biceps.)
HOSHI: I hope it's just a question of being
anxious.
TUCKER: What else could it be?
HOSHI: I saw my reflection become transparent. I saw water pass right
through my hand. I'm not convinced that the transporter put me back the
way it was supposed to.
TUCKER: All the king's horses and all the king's men. I can see why you
might imagine the universe unraveling. If you're afraid you haven't
been put back together right, why assume anything else makes sense? If
I were you, I'd ask the Doc for a sedative. Nothing like crawling into
bed.
HOSHI: You men are all alike.
TUCKER: Wait and see. A night's sleep will do you a world of good.
(He leaves, and Hoshi finds she can't affect the resistance controls
anymore, or lift a dumbbell because her hand goes straight through it.
She runs to leave but the doors won't open for her. Then, as she stares
into the wall mirror, her reflection disappears. Later, Hoshi has been sleeping on the gym floor when T'Pol and Trip
walk in.)
HOSHI: Thank God you're here. I've been stuck in here for hours. The
door control is
TUCKER: She was here last night, right over there.
HOSHI: Commander.
T'POL: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
T'POL: Have the security details reported back?
ARCHER [OC]: No sign of her yet.
T'POL: We've covered the forward section of C deck. She's not here.
HOSHI: Yes, she is.
TUCKER: Have you tried the biosensors again, Captain?
ARCHER [OC]: Still nothing.
TUCKER: I'll go take a look at them.
ARCHER [OC]: I'm going to maintain our present orbit until Hoshi turns
up. T'Pol, meet me in Sickbay right away.
T'POL: Yes, sir.
(Hoshi runs out through the open door after them.)
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: She came to Sickbay after the incident with
the storm, then a second time early last night.
ARCHER: She wasn't feeling well?
PHLOX: She said she felt shaky. You're aware that was the first time
she'd ever transported?
T'POL: Quite aware.
PHLOX: I believed that was the source of her anxiety. She was convinced
her molecules hadn't been reassembled properly. I should've taken her
more seriously. These are the biomolecular scans I took during each of
her two visits. (We see Hoshi is sitting on a desk, listening.) PHLOX: They
seemed perfectly normal at the time. When I heard she was missing
something made me take a closer look. You see these protein filaments?
Now look at this.
ARCHER: I'm going to need some help here, Phlox.
PHLOX: Look how much her subcellular membranes have degraded. These
scans were taken less than twenty four hours apart. It's virtually
impossible.
ARCHER: What's impossible?
T'POL: Ensign Sato wasn't imagining it. Her molecules are coming apart.
 [Transporter alcove]
(Tucker is staring at a diagnostic screen.)  TUCKER: It's the
secondary phase coils.
ARCHER: What about them?
TUCKER: They're not aligning. They're not perfectly synchronised.
Must've happened right after it came up from the surface.
PHLOX: If they're not perfectly synchronised?
T'POL: The resequencing would start to dissipate. Within hours, she'll
lose molecular cohesion.
TUCKER: She didn't want to go first. I told her I wouldn't leave her
alone with that storm coming but she insisted on going second. She
wanted to be sure it was working, that it was safe. I'm the one who
should be missing. I told her to go first. She should've listened to
me.
HOSHI: It wasn't your fault.
ARCHER: Take the transporter offline and figure out what went wrong.
Starfleet promised me this sort of thing wouldn't happen.
TUCKER: Aye, sir.
PHLOX: Captain, if there was a loss of molecular cohesion I'm afraid we
shouldn't be looking for Hoshi, per se.
ARCHER: What should we be looking for?
PHLOX: Subcellular residue. There wouldn't be anything left by now
except for subcellular residue.
HOSHI: You're wrong, Doctor. I'm still in one piece. You just can't see
me.
ARCHER: (to T'Pol) Have the Doctor help you recalibrate the sensors.
Then start scanning for this residue. Archer to Mayweather.
TRAVIS [OC]: Go ahead, sir.
ARCHER: Prepare to break orbit and resume previous course.
TRAVIS: [OC]: Aye, Captain.
ARCHER: I'll be in, my ready room. (He walks through Hoshi as he leaves,
slowly and sadly.)
 [Jefferies tube]
(Phlox scans the area.)  PHLOX: There's no way to be
certain this is her.
TUCKER: Is it Hoshi's DNA or isn't it?
PHLOX: It's difficult to tell. The amino acids have broken down.
HOSHI: Don't waste your time. It's not me.
TUCKER: The internal scan said access shaft B7. She's got to be here
somewhere.
HOSHI: If you spent a little more time trying to figure out what
happened to (She hears another voice and goes to investigate.)
ALIEN [OC]: (something)
TUCKER [OC]: What's the problem?
REED [OC]: The stream's too unstable.
HOSHI: Lieutenant?
REED [OC]: You can do it, Ensign. It's as easy as one, two
TUCKER: Here, Doc, over here. What do you think?
PHLOX: Try isolating the dipeptides. Now run a comparison with her
genetic profile. (The scanner shows a match.)
TUCKER: Why would she have come down here?
PHLOX: I doubt we'll ever know, Commander. Captain Archer will want
Hoshi's parents to have this. (He scrapes a bit of gloop up off the floor
into a small envelope.) PHLOX: They're both alive, aren't they?
TUCKER: Yeah, both alive. You go ahead, Doc. I'm going to stick around
for a minute.
PHLOX: I understand. (Phlox leaves.)
TUCKER: Hoshi.
HOSHI: You can see me?
TUCKER: I should've made you go first. What could I have been thinking
leaving you down there? I was the ranking officer, and I had no
business leaving a subordinate in the path of those storms. Why didn't
you listen to me? I told you we'd be safe. And now look what you've
done. (Tucker leaves.)
ALIEN [OC]: (something)
(Hoshi goes to investigate again, and sees a pale scaled alien fixing
devices to the bulkheads and talking to a companion who is doing the
same.)
 [Ready room]
 (Archer is pacing when Hoshi walks through the
closed door.)
HOSHI: Captain, I need you to listen to me. There are aliens on board
from the surface. They're planting bombs on D deck. You've got to hear
me. The ship is in danger.
(The comm. chimes)
ARCHER: Go ahead.
BAIRD [OC]: We've located her father, sir. The mother isn't home.
ARCHER: What time is it there?
BAIRD [OC]: Oh nine hundred.
ARCHER: Put him through. (He sits down in front of his desk monitor.) ARCHER: Good
morning, sir.
SATO [on monitor]: Captain Archer. Is everything all right?
ARCHER: No sir, everything is not all right. We've had an accident with
our transporting device.
SATO [on monitor]: Transporting device? What is that?
HOSHI: You don't have time for this.
ARCHER: A matter stream converter. It was approved for transporting
bio-matter before we left Earth.
HOSHI: I'll find something that'll get your attention. (She starts going
around the room, putting her hand into the bulkheads at various places.)
ARCHER: We've used it a number of times to
SATO [on monitor]: Bio-matter? What are you referring to, produce or
people?
ARCHER: I'm just trying to explain to you that Star Fleet told us it
was safe.
SATO [on monitor]: So, Hoshi is safe.
ARCHER: No, sir. There was an accident. She began to, her molecules
began to destabilise.
SATO [on monitor]: Her molecules? What are you talking about, Captain?
ARCHER: This isn't easy, sir. I fought to get Hoshi to come on this
mission. I'm responsible for her being out here. She's, become a member
of our family.
SATO [on monitor]: Family? We're her family, not you. Why are you
calling me? To say that she has become a member of your family? I'm
sorry, Captain. You are not making any sense.
(Hoshi finds a conduit that makes a noise when she 'touches' it.)
ARCHER: We lost Hoshi today, Mister Sato. I wish I didn't have to tell
you that.
SATO [on monitor]: You are saying Hoshi is dead?
HOSHI: We're all going to be dead if I don't get him to notice this.
SATO [on monitor]: Maybe, you could call us back later. This afternoon?
HOSHI: How about Morse code? You know Morse Code, don't you?
SATO [on monitor]: I must have time to speak to Hoshi's mother.
HOSHI: Come on, listen.
ARCHER: This afternoon.
HOSHI: Can you hear it?
ARCHER: I'm so sorry.
SATO [on monitor]: So am I. (Transmission ends.)
HOSHI: Come on. (Archer turns his head towards the tiny noises.) HOSIHI: That's
right. It's not supposed to be making that noise, is it? Listen, you
can hear it. SOS. SOS. It's a call for help. I need you to hear it.
(Archer sees the indicator light on the ceiling beam flashing in time
to Hoshi's signal.)
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol.
T'POL [OC]: Yes, Captain?
ARCHER: Could you come in here for a minute?
T'POL [OC]: Right away.
HOSHI: That's right, show it to her. One of you will figure it out.
(T'Pol enters.)
ARCHER: Look at this. I've never heard it make that noise before.
T'POL: The plasma circuit's being interrupted. I'll ask Commander
Tucker to take a look at it.
ARCHER: Listen to the pattern. Three dots, three dashes, three dots.
SOS.
T'POL: Dots?
ARCHER: Dots and dashes. Morse code. Its been used on Earth for
centuries. It's a distress call.
HOSHI: Let's see how good your memory is. H, O,
T'POL: It's changed.
HOSHI: S, H,
ARCHER: It still sounds like Morse code.
HOSHI: I. Come on.
T'POL: This plasma circuit is self-contained. No one outside of this
room could be using it to send a message.
HOSHI: I'm not outside this room, I'm right here.
T'POL: It's been a very difficult day. Perhaps you should try to get
some rest.
ARCHER: You're right. I'll have Trip look at it tomorrow.
HOSHI: Tomorrow's too late. They're going to blow up the ship. Captain!(The aliens have finished planting their devices in the Jefferies,
and are now arming them. Hoshi follows them as they go to Engineering, where she watches through a ventilation grill as
they put devices on the warp core right under the eyes of the unseeing
engineering staff.)
 [Jefferies tube]
 (While an alien's back is turned, Hoshi puts her
hand into one of the bombs and switches it off. All the devices disarm.
The second alien comes in and replaces the damaged unit, and Hoshi
cannot turn this one off. The aliens cannot see her either. Then the
aliens make a bigger device materialise. It's a transporter platform,
and one uses it to leave while the other gets the bombs rearmed.)
HOSHI: No, wait!
(The remaining alien beams away.)
TUCKER [OC]: What's the problem?
HOSHI: What?
REED [OC]: The stream's too unstable.
TUCKER [OC]: Come on, Hoshi, come on.
REED [OC]: You can do it, Ensign. (she jumps onto the alien transporter
pad) It's as easy as one, two (she dematerialises)
 [Transporter alcove]
 REED: Three.
(Hoshi materialises, dressed in her uniform and looking windswept and
holding an equipment case)
TUCKER: Nice work, Malcolm. See, I told you. Piece of cake. (Hoshi puts down her case and rushes off the platform.)
HOSHI: Where are they?
We've got to stop them.
TUCKER: Who?
HOSHI: You heard me? You can hear me? Do you see me?
REED: Everything's fine, Hoshi.
HOSHI: (storming off) It's not fine. They put a bomb on the warp
reactor.  (Tucker grabs her arm.)
TUCKER: Who?
HOSHI: The aliens from the surface.
TUCKER: There's no one on the surface. It's uninhabited.
HOSHI: What are you talking about? They kidnapped you and Travis. We've
got to stop them.
REED: Hoshi, the transporter was affected by the storms. I had some
trouble reintegrating your matter stream.
HOSHI: Trouble?
TUCKER: You were sort of, trapped in the pattern buffer. But only for a
few seconds.
REED: Eight point three seconds, to be precise.
HOSHI: Are you saying that I was just on the surface?
TUCKER: You insisted on going second.
HOSHI: Do you have a mirror?
REED: What?
HOSHI: Forget it. And I was sure I was going to be the next Cyrus
Ramsey.
TUCKER: Cyrus who?
 [Sickbay]
(Hoshi is being examined by Phlox.)  HOSHI: So you're saying
all of that happened in eight seconds?
PHLOX: Actually, it probably happened in the last one or two seconds as
your matter stream was coalescing. She seems fine.
ARCHER: Malcolm is recommending some new transport protocols to Star
Fleet. He's suggesting we start compressing the transport beam.
HOSHI: Well, I hope you don't plan on beaming me anywhere for a long
time.
ARCHER: But you said you stepped on to the aliens' transporter by
choice.
HOSHI: I was trying to save Enterprise.
ARCHER: Sounds like you overcame your fear.
HOSHI: It's all in my head, remember?
ARCHER: Does it matter? You were afraid of getting lost, afraid of
disappearing, but you still climbed on to that platform, real or not.
HOSHI: If it's all the same to you, sir, I'd like to stick to
shuttlepods for the time being.
ARCHER: Come on. Let's go to the Bridge. (As Archer reaches for the door control.)
HOSHI: Captain, if you don't mind.
(He steps back and lets her open the door for herself.)

Precious
Cargo
 Mission Date: Sep 12, 2152
Original Airdate: 11 Dec, 2002
  [Tucker's
quarters]
 (Tucker has his feet up on his desk and is playing
a harmonica, when he notices that they have just dropped out of warp.
He gets up and sees a tug approaching, hauling two cargo pods almost as
Enterprise hersel.f)
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: Go ahead.
ARCHER [OC]: I know you're off duty, but we've got visitors.
TUCKER: I can see that.
ARCHER [OC]: Are you up for a little repair work?
TUCKER: Sir?
ARCHER [OC]: Meet me at Docking Port two.
TUCKER: On my way.
 [Docking Port two]
 TUCKER: Anything serious?
ARCHER: They said they were having trouble with one of their life
support systems.
TUCKER: Who's they?
T'POL: Retellian cargo pilots. The seal is secure.
(The hatches are opened and Archer steps through to shake hands. The
visitors have flat ends to their noses.)
ARCHER: Welcome aboard.
GOFF: Gracious of you to help us, Captain. We were beginning to think
our distress call would never be answered.
ARCHER: This is Sub-Commander T'Pol and my Chief Engineer, Commander
Tucker.
PLINN: Our salvation.
TUCKER: The Captain said something about life support.
GOFF: We were hired to return a young woman to her home world. A few
days ago her stasis pod began to malfunction.
ARCHER: Stasis? Is she injured?
GOFF: No, no. She's a passenger, but our ship is designed to haul
cargo, not people and it's a very long journey. Putting her in
suspended animation was our only choice.
PLINN: We have another five months ahead of us. If she wakes up there
won't be enough food, air to breathe. If we're forced to abort the
mission we won't get paid.
T'POL: Commander Tucker is resourceful. I'm sure he'll be able to
assist you.
TUCKER: Mind if I have a look?
PLINN: Please.
(He leaves with Tucker.)
GOFF: You've been very accommodating. If it's not too much trouble I'd
like to make another request. It's been a long time since we've enjoyed
the luxury of a bath.
ARCHER: I understand. T'Pol will show you to guest quarters. When
you're done, I'll have my chef prepare you a meal.
 [Retellian cargo hold]
 (Lots of drooping tubing, netting and general
mess, and one frost encrusted stasis pod.)
PLINN: This regulates power flow to the biopod.
TUCKER: Looks very creative.
PLINN: These relays are from an old Ardanan shuttle. They weren't
designed to carry this much current.
TUCKER: I've got some EPS conduits that might do the trick.
(He takes a look at the pod's monitor.)
TUCKER: This would be a lot easier if I could read your language. If
you don't mind, I'd like to ask our Communications Officer to give me a
hand.
PLINN: By all means.
(Tucker wipes some frost off the pod and gazes at the lovely face of an
olive-skinned woman with little freckles around the temples.)
PLINN: Is there a problem?
TUCKER: No. No, no problem. I'm going to need some tools from
Enterprise. With a little luck, Sleeping Beauty here will never know
there was a problem.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in.
(Goff enters, looking much pinker than previously.)
GOFF: I hope I didn't deplete your water supply.
ARCHER: I'm sure we'll manage. Please. (Goff sits) T'Pol tells me your
vessel can't do much better than warp two.
GOFF: Warp two point two.
ARCHER: I've been making some calculations. If I'm not mistaken, at
warp four point five Enterprise can have you at your destination in
less than four days.
GOFF: That's a generous offer, but I've already inconvenienced you far
too much.
ARCHER: It's no inconvenience. We're out here to meet new people.
You're heading toward an inhabited world we've never seen. First
contacts tend to go more smoothly when a familiar face is making the
introductions.
GOFF: I'm sure you'll do fine on your own.
ARCHER: You could dock in our launch bay. You wouldn't have to worry
about that stasis pod. We have plenty of room for you and your
passenger.
GOFF: It's not that simple, Captain. This has all been carefully
prearranged. Her family's not expecting her for another five months.
They're not even on her home world at the moment. But I will accept
your offer of a meal, if it's not too late.
 [Retellian cargo bay]
 HOSHI: Commander? Hello?
(Tucker pops up from under the flooring.)
TUCKER: Is that the translation?
HOSHI: Give or take an adverb.
TUCKER: Thanks.
(Hoshi looks at the woman.)
HOSHI: At least you don't have to work alone.
TUCKER: Hell of a way to travel, isn't it?
HOSHI: Who is she? Any idea?
TUCKER: I asked Plinn but he doesn't seem to know too much about her.
He said something about studying medicine in a research colony.
HOSHI: A doctor?
TUCKER: I suppose so. She must have a real passion for it if she's
willing to go through all this. Shame we'll never get to meet her.
HOSHI: It's not polite to stare, Commander.
TUCKER: What's that supposed to mean?
HOSHI: Let me know if you have any problems with that translation.
TUCKER: I wasn't staring.
(Hoshi leaves, then Tucker hears a thumping sound.)
TUCKER: Hoshi?
(It's coming from the stasis pod. The passenger has woken up and is
fighting to get out.)
TUCKER: Are you all right?
 [Captain's mess]
 (Archer, T'Pol, Plinn and Goff are eating when
Goff's pager goes off.)
ARCHER: Problem?
GOFF: The stasis pod.
T'POL: What about it?
GOFF: It's malfunctioning. If you'll excuse me, Captain.
(He gets up.)
T'POL: I'll show you to the docking port.
GOFF: I know the way. 
 [Retellian cargo bay]
 (The woman is shouting and thumping at the pod lid
as Trip tries to crowbar it open. Goff grabs his arm.)
GOFF: What are you doing?
TUCKER: Help me open this thing!
GOFF: We can't bring her out of stasis.
TUCKER: She's suffocating!
(Goff goes to the control module.)
TUCKER: The release is jammed. Don't bother.
(Finally he hauls the lid open, and we see she has her wrists tied.)
TUCKER: I'm sorry about this, but the O2 recycler went offline.
KAITAAMA: Dulsha tot!
TUCKER: You're going to be all right.
KAITAAMA: Kosh vos!
(Goss hits Tucker with the crowbar.)
 [Captain's mess]
 {Plinn is lifting a fork full of spaghetti to his
mouth when his pager goes off.)
PLINN: Yes?
GOSS [OC]: There's a minor problem. I'm going to need your assistance.
PLINN: What kind of problem?
GOSS [OC]: The malfunction is more complicated than I expected.
PLINN: I'll be there in a moment. I don't mean to be rude.
(Plinn dashes out.)
ARCHER: Not at all. Archer to Commander Tucker. Trip, can you hear me?
(changes channel) Archer to Lieutenant Reed.
 [Corridor]
 REED: Mister Plinn?
PLINN: (still walking) That's right.
(Reed walks alongside with a security man at the rear.)
REED: Lieutenant Reed. The Captain asked me to escort you back to your
ship.
PLINN: That won't be necessary.
REED: I'm afraid I'm under orders.
PLINN: Have I done something wrong?
REED: It's just a precaution.
PLINN: I never realised leaving the Captain's table would cause so much
concern.
(As they approach the docking port, Goss sees Plinn under escort and
fires a weapon at the group. The three dive for cover, then Goss dashes
back inside his ship and seals his airlock. The freighter's engines
power up as Archer and T'Pol arrive.)
REED: He's trying to break loose.
ARCHER: Secure the docking clamps.
(But the big ship rips away from Enterprise, and they go in pursuit.)
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Report.
TRAVIS: He hasn't gotten far at warp two, sir.
ARCHER: Hail him.
HOSHI: No response.
ARCHER: Phase cannons. Target his engines.
REED: Direct hit to the port nacelle. He's dropping out of warp.
ARCHER: Bring us into grappling range. Hail him again.
TRAVIS: Captain.
(A cloud of something from the freighter covers the viewscreen.)
ARCHER: T'Pol?
T'POL: Dilithium hydroxls. Ionised pyrosulfates.
TRAVIS: He's moving off.
ARCHER: Stay with him.
(The freighter goes to warp.)
ARCHER: I thought you took out one of his nacelles?
REED: So did I.
TRAVIS: Our warp drive won't engage.
REED: That cloud he released, it got into the plasma vents. They'll
have to be purged.
TRAVIS: He's moving out of sensor range. I've lost him.
 [Retellian cargo hold]
 (Tucker awakes with a sore head only to be hit
again by the woman.)
KAITAAMA: Tuvat at.
TUCKER: What the hell did you do that for?
KAITAAMA: Tuvat at.
TUCKER: Hold on. Hold on. I'm not working with them.
KAITAAMA: Luvasta eeva. Destas.
TUCKER: Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm, I'm from a starship
called Enterprise. Enterprise. Now put that thing down and I'll untie
you. Your hands, I'll free your hands. Let me help you.
KAITAAMA: Has trava dukla.
(Goss burst in with his gun, and Tucker stands between him and
Kaitaama.)
TUCKER: What the hell's going on?
GOSS: Is it repaired?
TUCKER: What?
GOSS: The stasis pod.
TUCKER: Where's Captain Archer?
GOSS: Your ship is a long way from here.
KAITAAMA: Slovasa toraya.
GOSS: Repair the pod so we can put her back in stasis.
TUCKER: It's going to take a few hours.
GOSS: Work quickly.
(Goss leaves.)
(Tucker unties Kaitaama's hands)
KAITAAMA: Am sotey.
TUCKER: You're welcome?
KAITAAMA: Tule bas?
TUCKER: Have you seen a little device? It's about this big, has a
keypad on it. It's my Universal Translator. It'll help us understand
each other.
(She finds it.)
KAITAAMA: Has nos?
TUCKER: That's it. It's just so we can talk.
(She hands it over.)
TUCKER: I need you to say something. You got to keep talking.
KAITAAMA: Votni vay, atayun ponas.
TUCKER: A little more.
KAITAAMA: Akasa jorat. Foraya nuratay. fegasa ana a'hanjura.
TUCKER: Can you understand me?
KAITAAMA: Serotta jho.
TUCKER: Where's Hoshi when you need her?
KAITAAMA: Who is Hoshi?
TUCKER: That's better. Would you mind telling me what's going on here?
KAITAAMA: How long have I been in stasis?
TUCKER: You'd have to ask them.
(He gets out his communicator.)
TUCKER: Commander Tucker to Enterprise. Enterprise, do you hear me?
KAITAAMA: You are an officer?
TUCKER: Chief Engineer. Feels like we've gone to warp.
KAITAAMA: Explain yourself. What do you know about my abductors?
TUCKER: We thought they were cargo pilots. They claimed you were their
passenger.
KAITAAMA: I am their prisoner. I was returning from a diplomatic
mission when they attacked my transport, murdered my guards. You don't
know who I am, do you?
TUCKER: Should I?
KAITAAMA: My family is known on hundreds of worlds.
TUCKER: Well, I'm afraid Earth isn't one of them. So I take it you're
not a doctor.
KAITAAMA: I am First Monarch of the Sovereign Dynasty of Krios Prime.
TUCKER: Oh. Charles Tucker the third. Please to meet you. So what do
these guys want?
KAITAAMA: Ransom. No doubt they'll demand a high price for my safe
return.
TUCKER: Listen, my Captain'll be looking for me. All we have to do is
get off this ship and let him know where we are.
KAITAAMA: And how do you propose we do that?
TUCKER: I saw a shuttlebay earlier. There were a couple of escape pods.
KAITAAMA: You're not going anywhere.
TUCKER: I beg your pardon?
KAITAAMA: We'll remain here until they contact the Sovereign Guard.
Once the ransom has been paid, we'll be released.
TUCKER: Well, if it's all the same to you I'd rather take my chances in
open space.
KAITAAMA: It's too dangerous. If you leave, it would provoke them.
(Tucker crouches by a hatch.)
TUCKER: If I remember right this access tube leads to a junction near
the shuttlebay.
KAITAAMA: You are not to leave this chamber.
TUCKER: With all due respect, I'm not one of your subjects.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: He's your partner. You must have some idea
where he's going.
PLINN: Obviously, I'm his victim as well. Why else would he leave me
here?
T'POL: Where were you taking your passenger?
PLINN: Goff had the coordinates.
ARCHER: You don't even know what system you were heading for?
PLINN: It wasn't my responsibility. He was piloting the ship, not me. I
spent most of my time looking after the cargo. Believe me, Captain I'm
as eager to find my partner as you are.
ARCHER: If that's true, then we could work together to track him down.
PLINN: I don't see how.
ARCHER: We've got pretty good long range sensors, but your ship could
be anywhere within a half dozen light years. It'd be a lot easier if we
knew your warp frequency.
PLINN: Well, I'm afraid I can't help you with that. I know very little
about warp engines.
ARCHER: Take him back to Docking Port Two. Put him in the airlock and
post a security detail.
PLINN: I'm telling you the truth!
ARCHER: We'll keep the outer hatch unlocked. If you decide to leave,
you know the way out.
 [Retellian cargo bay]
 (Tucker is working to unlock a hatch while the
Monarch paces.)
TUCKER: Could you hand me that circuit probe? The one with the green
handle?
(He has to get it himself.)
TUCKER: You must be one hell of a diplomat.
KAITAAMA: Is your entire species so ill-mannered?
TUCKER: No, just me.
KAITAAMA: You know, if you were thinking rationally you'd be repairing
that stasis pod. He did threaten to kill you.
TUCKER: That's precisely why I'm getting out of here. I really doubt
they're going to keep me around once I fix their problem. You know, I
realise someone in your position isn't used to taking advice from a guy
like me, but I strongly suggest you come along.
KAITAAMA: He'd never harm me. I'm too valuable to them.
TUCKER: I've been involved in a few hostage situations. They rarely
turn out the way you expect.
KAITAAMA: You're correct, Mister Tucker. I don't take advice from
people like you.
TUCKER: You know, that stasis pod won't fix itself. Chances are you're
going to spend the next five months tied up in this grimy little cargo
hold. Not exactly my idea of a royal voyage.
KAITAAMA: I'll be fine.
TUCKER: When I get back to Enterprise I'll make sure we get a message
to your homeworld. Krios?
KAITAAMA: Krios Prime.
TUCKER: Take care.
KAITAAMA: Once you launch an escape pod what makes you think they won't
destroy it?
TUCKER: I'm going to reroute their internal sensors. I'll be a million
kilometres away before they know I'm gone. I'm much better company.
 [Crawlspace]
 KAITAAMA: How much farther?
TUCKER: Just a few more metres.
KAITAAMA: Are you sure this is the right direction?
TUCKER: Keep your voice down. What am I supposed to call you, anyway?
First Monarch? Your Highness?
KAITAAMA: Kaitaama.
TUCKER: What is that? Some kind of a title?
KAITAAMA: It's my name.
(Tucker stops to do something to a panel's interior.)
KAITAAMA: What are you doing?
TUCKER: These lead to internal sensors.
(He finishes what he's doing, then removes a grid further along and
jumps down to the floor. She puts her head out and hesitates.)
TUCKER: We don't have all day.
(Helps her down and then opens an escape pod hatch.)
KAITAAMA: This is meant for one person.
TUCKER: We'll have to make do. Unless you know how to fly one of these
things.
(She tries to get in, but her long dress hampers her movements so she
rips it off at mid-thigh.)
 [Escape pod]
 (Trip powers it up and launches successfully. The
ride gets rather bumpy.)
KAITAAMA: What was that?
TUCKER: We're crossing the subspace threshold.
(The juddering stops.)
TUCKER: That wasn't so bad.
KAITAAMA: What do you propose we do next?
TUCKER: To be honest, I hadn't really thought about it.
KAITAAMA: I assumed you had a plan.
TUCKER: I was only joking. They do have a sense of humour where you
come from?
KAITAAMA: Among the commoners. Only joking.
TUCKER: It's only a matter of time before they realise we're gone. No
doubt they'll come about and look for us. We need a place to hide.
KAITAAMA: Where?
TUCKER: If I'm translating this right, there's a system about ninety
million kilometres from here. We should be able to reach it in a day or
so.
KAITAAMA: What makes you think any of those planets are habitable?
TUCKER: Only one way to find out. Permission to set a course, your
Sovereignty?
KAITAAMA: Proceed.
(Later, Trip is trying to get the pod controls sorted out.)
TUCKER: Look, this would be a whole lot easier if you'd stop moving
around.
KAITAAMA: You're touching me.
TUCKER: I'm afraid I don't have much choice.
KAITAAMA: It's inappropriate to touch the First Monarch.
TUCKER: You're welcome to step outside until I'm done. Excuse me.
(He reaches across to a panel above her head.)
TUCKER: There we go. Landing thrusters, No, wait, they're stabilisers.
KAITAAMA: You have no idea how to control this vehicle.
TUCKER: I'm working on it.
KAITAAMA: Even if we do find a breathable atmosphere and you manage to
land without killing us, what will we do about food? Water? There could
be hostile lifeforms on the surface. How will we protect ourselves?
TUCKER: Look, I've got less than twenty four hours to figure out how to
scan a star system and programme a descent sequence in a language I
don't understand, and I'm not going to get it done with you
interrupting me every five seconds. So I'd appreciate it if you'd keep
quiet until I'm finished. Now, lift your butt.
KAITAAMA: My what?
TUCKER: Your behind, your rear end. I haven't checked that panel yet.
(He opens a box to see a nice lever with a big red knob on it.)
KAITAAMA: Quickly.
TUCKER: You know, you were a lot more pleasant in stasis.
(He leans right across her.)
TUCKER: I think I found the landing thrusters. I understand how
difficult this must be for someone of your upbringing, but we could be
stuck out here for awhile. We should find a way to get along. I'm
willing to give it a try if you are.
KAITAAMA: My hand. You're sitting on my hand. I'll try.
 [Enterprise]
 (It's semi dark, and there appears to be just one
table and chair here. Reed and a guard enter with Plinn.)
REED: The prisoner, sir, as ordered.
ARCHER: Thank you.
REED: Will there be anything else, Captain?
ARCHER: Not right now, Lieutenant. Dismissed.
(Reed and the guard leave.)
ARCHER: Have a seat.
PLINN: Why have I been brought here?
ARCHER: Sit down. (Plinn
sits on the lone chair.)
PLINN: I already told you everything I know.
ARCHER: We're not here to talk about your partner. We're here to talk
about you.
PLINN: What about me?
ARCHER: You're facing some very serious charges, Mister Plinn. Where we
come from criminals are held accountable for their actions. If they're
found guilty, they're punished. This is where your tribunal is going to
take place.
PLINN: Tribunal?
(Plinn leaps to his feet.)
PLINN: I am not subject to your laws.
ARCHER: That's not for me to decide.
(Plinn sits again.)
ARCHER: Starfleet asked the Vulcan High Command to assign a judicial
administrator to Enterprise. Someone who wouldn't be swayed by human
emotion. Someone objective, logical. From what I understand,
Sub-commander T'Pol has already reviewed the evidence. This tribunal is
nothing more than a formality. I thought you should be prepared. Her
punishments can be severe.
PLINN: How severe?
ARCHER: If you're late for your shift you might receive a beating. But
for more grievous offenses, dereliction of duty, conduct unbecoming an
officer. We started out with eighty three crewmen on board. We're down
to seventy six.
PLINN: But I haven't done anything wrong.
ARCHER: Accessory to kidnapping, resisting arrest, obstruction of an
investigation, causing damage to a Starfleet vessel.
PLINN: What damage?
ARCHER: When your partner fled he released a cloud of dilithium
hydroxls that clogged our plasma vents.
PLINN: I had nothing to do with that.
ARCHER: As I said, I'm not the one you have to convince.
(The door bell chimes and the door opens. Archer gestures Plinn to
stand and then bows from the waist.)
ARCHER: Sub-commander.
(T'Pol is wearing V'Lar's costume from Fallen Hero, or something very
similar.)
T'POL: Has the accused been informed of the charges?
ARCHER: Yes, ma'am.
T'POL: How much do you weigh?
PLINN: What?
T'POL: Your weight.
PLINN: Seventy two kilograms.
T'POL: Height?
PLINN: One point eight metres. Why are you asking these questions?
T'POL: Does your culture observe any postmortem rituals?
PLINN: This is not fair. I demand to speak with someone from my
government.
ARCHER: He's got a point. We've never tried an alien before. Maybe we
should contact the High Command.
T'POL: They've granted me complete autonomy in these matters. If I had
to consult my superiors every time I made a ruling it would defeat my
purpose here. We'll convene at eighteen hundred hours.
ARCHER: As you wish.
(T'Pol sweeps out of the room as the pair bow.)
PLINN: You can't allow this.
ARCHER: There's nothing I can do.
PLINN: But you're the Captain.
ARCHER: She owes me a few favours. I can't promise anything but I, I'd
be willing to ask for leniency. Of course, I'd want something in
return. We still haven't found a way to locate your vessel. If you
could remember that warp frequency.
 [Escape pod]
 KAITAAMA: Are there any provisions? I'm hungry.
TUCKER: You might check that storage compartment above your head.
KAITAAMA: You do it.
TUCKER: I'm busy.
(After a short sulk, she opens the compartment.)
TUCKER: If you find any water up there, I could use some.
(Something falls down.)
TUCKER: Thanks.
(He takes a sip through a tube as she struggles to open a container.)
TUCKER: Allow me.
(They swap, and she looks at the drinking tube with suspicion.)
TUCKER: I'm not contagious.
(Tucker opens the container and sniffs at a biscuit.)
KAITAAMA: Is it edible? (Tucker
takes a bite.)
TUCKER: Depends how hungry you are.
(She nibbles genteelly.)
TUCKER: It reminds me of my first car.
KAITAAMA: Car?
TUCKER: A four-wheeled vehicle. Wasn't much bigger than this. All we're
missing is the ocean breeze coming off the Gulf. I used to drive out to
a place called Chatkin Point, park along the shoreline and stare at the
moon with my girlfriend. Don't worry. I won't make a pass at you.
KAITAAMA: The Sovereign Guard would cut off one of your hands.
TUCKER: You must be a fun date.
KAITAAMA: The First Monarch doesn't socialise with the opposite sex.
TUCKER: You've never been on a date?
KAITAAMA: Four years ago, before I was selected to ascend to First
Monarch, I was courted by young men from many noble families. Now I
spend my personal time in the company of my father's advisors.
TUCKER: Sounds kind of lonely.
KAITAAMA: You haven't finished your work.
(Later, the little pod approaches a planet and they study the sensor
readouts.)
KAITAAMA: It's all water.
TUCKER: There's a chain of islands near the equator.
KAITAAMA: Will we be able to breathe?
TUCKER: Oxygen, nitrogen, a trace of methane. Nothing we can't handle.
KAITAAMA: Do you detect any lifeforms?
TUCKER: If I could figure out how to use the bio-sensors.
KAITAAMA: Are you certain we have the correct planet?
TUCKER: It's the only one with an atmosphere.
KAITAAMA: You may begin our descent.
TUCKER: Let's hope I get this right. (the pod tumbles and fires it's
little thrusters to slow their descent) We're entering the
thermosphere. The port stabiliser's down.
KAITAAMA: Can you repair it?
TUCKER: No, but the starboard one should keep us on course. (the ride
gets rough and the heat shield glows)
KAITAAMA: Mister Tucker!
TUCKER: So far so good. Eight thousand metres. I think they're metres.
Seven thousand. I'm pretty sure the braking thrusters are firing. Five
thousand metres. You might want to grab hold of something.
(She puts her arms around him.)
TUCKER: Two thousand metres. One thousand. Hold on.
(They hit the ground and we see them upside down.)
TUCKER: You all right?
KAITAAMA: What is that?
TUCKER: Damned if I know.
 [Planet surface]
 (It's a lush, water-logged swamp, with animal
noises and rising steam. They leave the pod and wade away, carrying
their supplies.)
KAITAAMA: This heat is unbearable.
TUCKER: It's nothing compared to a summer in the Everglades. At least
there aren't any mosquitoes.
KAITAAMA: Where are we going?
TUCKER: Over there. Looks like a good place to set up camp.
KAITAAMA: Your vessel will never find us here.
TUCKER: Don't underestimate Captain Archer.
(They find a piece of higher, dry land and Kaitaama puts her shoes out
to dry.)
KAITAAMA: You're bleeding.
TUCKER: It's just a scratch.
KAITAAMA: Remove your uniform.
TUCKER: I'll take care of it later.
KAITAAMA: We have no idea what microbes live in this environment. It
could become infected.
TUCKER: I said later.
KAITAAMA: You're my only hope of surviving here, Mister Tucker. I don't
intend to let you die.
(He strips to the waist while she gets out the first aid kit. Tucker
sniffs the contents of a tube to see what it might be.)
TUCKER: This one.
(She gently dabs the ointment onto a cut on his back.)
KAITAAMA: Hold still. The provisions won't last for more than a day.
TUCKER: It sounds like there's plenty of wildlife. I grew up in a place
kind of like this. I don't think we're going to starve. And I can use
the thruster assembly from the pod to start a fire, boil some water.
Thanks.
KAITAAMA: You're welcome.
(Later, as Trip tries to make a fire lighter out of the thruster,
Kaitaama throws down a small handful of sticks.)
TUCKER: That's the best you could do?
KAITAAMA: There's very little dry wood.
TUCKER: Keep looking. (she sits down) What are you waiting for?
KAITAAMA: I'm not your servant. You're the one who was raised in a
primitive environment. You find the wood.
TUCKER: What's that supposed to mean?
KAITAAMA: You're obviously better suited to physical labour.
TUCKER: In case you haven't noticed, we're not in a palace. You said it
yourself. You won't survive without my help, so it seems to me that I'm
the one in charge. The king of the swamp. Now get your ass out there
and don't come back without an armful of dry wood.
KAITAAMA: I should have you imprisoned for speaking to me that way.
TUCKER: You should give me a medal. You'd be dead if it weren't for me.
KAITAAMA: I'm beginning to think that would be preferable.
TUCKER: I doubt the commoners back home would complain.
(She tries to hit him, he grabs her, they fall and roll down the slope
into the water.)
KAITAAMA: How dare you!
TUCKER: You're the one who took a swing at me.
KAITAAMA: You insulted the First Monarch!
TUCKER: I'm just a petty commoner, remember? Raised on a primitive,
(She
shuts him up by kissing him. They gasp for breath then he returns the
kiss. Later, Trip awakes lying with her beside a campfire, gets up and
pours some boiled water into a cup. Then he hears a beeping sound. She
wakes too.)
[Escape pod]
(They return to the pod, the source of the sound
and Tucker rips off a panel to reveal a blue flashing light.)
KAITAAMA: What's wrong?
TUCKER: A homing beacon. Unless I'm way off, someone just locked on to
it.
(He uses a stone to destroy it,)
KAITAAMA: Your vessel?
TUCKER: No way to tell.
[Planet surface]
(Goss comes sneaking up to the pod, then sees
Kaitaama and a figure in a blue uniform through the vegetation. He
fires at the uniform, but it's a dummy. Kaitaama runs off, Goss moves
in to investigate and Tucker jumps him from above. Sadly, good boxing
punches to the face have no effect on Goss, and Tucker gets thrown
against a rock and dazed. Goss tries to drown him but Kaitaama thumps
him over the head with a branch and knocks him out cold.)
KAITAAMA: Leave him.
(Tucker drags Goss onto drier ground.)
TUCKER: Let's find his weapon.
KAITAAMA: There's someone else here.
(The pair are groping around in the water, with their backs to us, when
there's a voice.)
ARCHER: Trip?
(They turn to see Archer, T'Pol and a grinning Reed.)
ARCHER: This a bad time?
 Captain's Star log, September 12th, 2152. We've
rendezvoused with a Krios battle cruiser, which has taken the
kidnappers into custody.
 [Corridor]
(Tucker is clean and fully dressed again.)
 TUCKER: So, when do you ascend?
(Kaitaama is also clean and in a slightly too-big uniform.)
KAITAAMA: Two hundred and forty six days.
TUCKER: It's a long shot, but maybe Enterprise will get the chance to
visit Krios Prime before then. Of course, from what you've told me I
doubt your family would let me see you.
KAITAAMA: I doubt they would, but once I've been made First Monarch
I'll have the authority to change the rules.
TUCKER: What kind of changes?
(She moves in close without actually touching.)
KAITAAMA: Come visit me. Perhaps you'll find out.

The
Catwalk
 Mission date: Sep 18, 2152
Original Airdate: 18 Dec, 2002

Captain's Starlog, September 18th, 2152. We've entered orbit of an
uninhabited planet. Our scans show it's teeming with all sorts of plant
and animal life. I'll be leading a survey team to the surface.
 [Launch bay]
 TUCKER: There's a gorge on the southern continent
five times deeper than the Grand Canyon.
ARCHER: What have you got in mind?
TUCKER: How about a little river rafting? T'Pol says it only gets dark
four days a month because of the binary suns. We'll have plenty of
daylight left after we're done working every night.
 [Shuttlepod]
(Archer settles into the shuttlepod.)  ARCHER: It's going
to take at least a week to complete the survey. Should be enough time
to sneak in some R and R.
T'POL [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: We've got an alien vessel approaching. They're hailing us.
ARCHER: Put them through to Shuttlepod One.
T'POL [OC]: Yes, sir.
TUCKER: New planet, new aliens. Banner day.
(An image of three bald males comes up on the monitor.)
TAGRIM [on monitor]: We're very relieved to see you. I'm Rellus Tagrim.
This is my crew.
ARCHER: Captain Archer of the Starship Enterprise. Something we can do
for you?
TAGRIM [on monitor]: Considering the circumstances, we would like
permission to come aboard as soon as possible.
ARCHER: What circumstances?
TAGRIM [on monitor]: The neutronic wavefront. It's almost here.
TUCKER: Nothing on sensors.
TAGRIM [on monitor]: You should detect the storm in a few minutes. It's
travelling at high warp. Once we're aboard, I suggest you go to warp
seven immediately.
ARCHER: Our top speed is warp five.
 [Situation room]
 T'POL: The wavefront spans more than half a dozen
light years. A Vulcan starship encountered a class five over a century
ago. The vessel was nearly destroyed.
ARCHER: How long until it hits?
T'POL: Approximately four hours.
REED: If we reinforce structural integrity we should be able to weather
it without too much trouble.
PHLOX: Enterprise may survive. The crew is another matter. The storm is
saturated with radiolytic isotopes. If the crew is exposed, they'll be
dead within three minutes. Sickbay is the most heavily shielded
section. It's possible that some of the crew could survive there.
ARCHER: We can't fit eighty three people into Sickbay, and I'm not
about to draw lots. (Tucker studies a schematic on another monitor.)
TUCKER: What about the
Catwalk? You know, the maintenance shaft running the length of each
nacelle.
ARCHER: They are heavily shielded. Some kind of osmium alloy, if I
remember.
T'POL: You're proposing we take refuge in a crawlspace?
TUCKER: It'll be a tight squeeze, but there's no reason we can't fit
eighty three people in there, and whatever supplies we need.
ARCHER: Doctor?
PHLOX: Do you know the absorption depth of this alloy?
TUCKER: At least twenty thousand particles per micron.
PHLOX: It should be adequate.
TUCKER: There's just one other problem. It gets kind of toasty in there
when the warp coils are online. About three hundred degrees. We'd have
to shut down the main reactor.
ARCHER: I don't see that we have any choice. We'll use the Catwalk, and
set up a command station in one of the compartments.
TUCKER: Aye, Captain.
ARCHER (to T'Pol) You'll be in charge of the evacuation. Take us out of
orbit, Travis.
 [Catwalk]
 (Long and narrow with rails either side of a
walkway just wide enough for two people to squeeze past each other.)
TRAVIS: Maybe we should open a window.
TUCKER: You think it's stuffy now, wait till we get eighty three people
in here.
TRAVIS: And don't forget Porthos, and all the Doctor's animals.
TUCKER: You ever been through a storm as bad as this?
TRAVIS: Ran into a Class three once. Had to take shelter in the ship's
core. We were down there for six weeks.
TUCKER: Six weeks?
TRAVIS: Any idea about a latrine?
TUCKER: Oh, I never thought about that. There are some storage lockers
in the aft compartment. We ought to be able to convert a couple of
them.
(They go through a hatchway into another section with control panels on
the wall.)
TUCKER: This'll be our Bridge. We're going to have to jury-rig these
panels, tap them into command functions.
TRAVIS: Not much room for a Captain's chair.
TUCKER: That storm must've been pretty scary.
TRAVIS: We only got worried when the generators went down. We lost the
grav-plating, life support. I'll never forget that look in my father's
eyes. He knew we were in trouble.
 [Corridor]
 (Phlox and Archer escort the three aliens out of
the Decon chamber.)
ARCHER: Sorry to keep you in there so long. Please.
TAGRIM: We understand.
ARCHER: My Science Officer tells me you're from the Takret system.
That's a long way from here.
TAGRIM: Our work often takes us far from home.
RENTH: We're stellar cartographers.
ARCHER: Really? Once we get out of the storm maybe you can help us
update our star charts.
TAGRIM: We'd be pleased.
PHLOX: This way.(The ship is a frenzy of activity. The warp
injectors are being locked down. Duffle bags are being passed up the
ladders to the catwalk, spacesuits are being packed and moved.)
 [Sickbay]
 T'POL: You're behind schedule. Do you need help?
PHLOX: I understand you've allotted fifteen cubic metres for medical
supplies?
T'POL: That's correct.
PHLOX: That means there's only enough room for two-thirds of these
cages.
T'POL: Perhaps some of your creatures could share.
PHLOX: They'll eat each other. They're vital to my work and the health
of this crew. I'm not accustomed to making emotional appeals. Please,
don't ask me to choose between them.
T'POL: All right. Twenty cubic metres.
PHLOX: My Edosian slugs thank you.
 [Catwalk]
 (People are setting in either side of the walkway.)
TUCKER: I'm afraid these aren't first class accommodations.
TAGRIM: They'll be fine, Commander. We're grateful for your
hospitality.
TUCKER: We're going to have a lot of time to get to know each other. If
you need anything, I'll be right over here.
(He leaves them.)
GURI: I don't know the first thing about stellar cartography.
TAGRIM: Guri.
GURI: What if they begin to ask questions?
 [Ready room]
 (Archer is doing some final packing when he pauses
to watch the purple ribbon-like phenomenon approaching. Hmm, familiar.)
ARCHER: Come in. (T'Pol enters) I didn't expect it to be beautiful. Too
bad we don't have time to run some scans.
T'POL: We'll be inside the phenomenon for nearly eight days. We can run
all the scans we want. Lieutenant Reed has completed his modifications.
ARCHER: I'm a little nervous about shutting down the power grid.
T'POL: A single neutronic surge could overload the grid and damage
critical systems.
ARCHER: I did a little research in the Vulcan database. That Class five
storm a century ago involved the Starship T'Plana. Apparently, they
couldn't outrun the wavefront. It was lost with all hands. I thought
you said it was nearly destroyed.
T'POL: I must have remembered incorrectly.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: (at helm) Bridge to Commander Tucker.
TUCKER [OC]: Go ahead.
ARCHER: Ready for the handoff?
 [Catwalk command area]
 TUCKER: Give me a second.(He and Travis press
screens and finally a bunch of unconnected optic cables light up.)
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER [OC]: Standing by, Captain.
(Archer looks across to Reed and then T'Pol, who touch their boards.)
 [Catwalk command area]
 (As monitors bring up the familiar Bridge
displays.)
TUCKER: We're in the driver's seat.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: See you in a few minutes. Archer out.
Let's close up shop.
(At the press of a button, main power goes down everywhere, to be
replaced by low level emergency lighting.)
 [Catwalk command area]
 ARCHER: Done a head count?
TUCKER: Entire crew's accounted for, including one quadruped. Would you
like to try out the Captain's chair?
(He pets Porthos then looks at a few barrels with netting on top.)
ARCHER: Maybe later. Where's the comm.? (Tucker gestures to a column.) ARCHER: All
hands, this is the Captain. This catwalk is going to be our home for a
while. A week, maybe more. You may not be comfortable, but you'll be
alive. We have the best crew in the fleet and the sturdiest ship. I
promise you, we'll get through this. (He closes the comm.) ARCHER: Time? (T'Pol's station is the other side of the column.)
T'POL: One minute, five
seconds.
ARCHER: Polarise the hull plating.
(Enterprise turns to face the oncoming storm.)
T'POL: Thirty seconds.
(The ship starts to shake.)
ARCHER: Travis?
TRAVIS: Spatial turbulence.
T'POL: Twenty seconds. Fifteen. Ten.
ARCHER: All hands, brace for impact.
(It gets very rough, and Porthos decides to hide.)
TRAVIS: Aft stabilisers aren't engaging.
TUCKER: Try them again.
(Things get smoother.)
TRAVIS: Grav-shear's dropping. (Porthos re-emerges.) TRAVIS: That should be the
worst of it, sir, at least for now.
 [Catwalk]
 (Archer is walking through, during jolts, and
picks up a small PADD.)
ARCHER Yours? Looks like you're almost finished.
(The crewwoman takes back her crossword puzzle.)
CREWWOMAN: You wouldn't know who was the first Vulcan ambassador to
Earth. Six letters, ends with an R?
ARCHER: Solkar, I think.
CREWWOMAN: Thanks, Captain.
ARCHER: Don't mention it. (He moves over to Hoshi.) ARCHER: How're you holding up? (Hoshi iscleaning her teeth with a light brush.)
HOSHI: Pretty well, sir. A few
days in this place should cure anyone of claustrophobia.
ARCHER: Your quarters will probably feel like a ballroom after this.
(There's another shake)
HOSHI: You're the Captain. Can't you order the storm to calm down a
little?
ARCHER: I'll see what I can do.
(He walks under the privacy curtain that will divide the women from the
men - a blanket actually. The alien guests have also put blankets up
around their area to screen it off. Subtitles give some of the
incidental conversations.)
VOICE: Someone has already asked for it, so why isn't he doing anything
about it?
CREWMAN: How should I know?
VOICE: Another day in this place.
VOICE: We're running out of food.
(There are at least two card games on the go.)
ARCHER: (referring to aliens) How're they doing?
TUCKER: Your guess is as good as mine. One of them came out a few hours
ago. Told us we were making too much noise. Now, I've been real
friendly. Even asked them to join the game. Doesn't seem like they want
anything to do with us.
ARCHER: Let's give them a little time to adjust.
TUCKER: You know, I bet by now we'd have set up camp on the rim of that
canyon, had a fire going.
ARCHER: There'll be other canyons.
(In another part of the catwalk.)
PHLOX: PalantiI, are you passing through or is there something I can
help you with?
REED: Actually, there is something. (Reed climbs down into Phlox's area.)
PHLOX: Yes?
REED: I assume I can depend on doctor-patient confidentiality.
PHLOX: This wouldn't have anything to do with gastrointestinal
distress?
REED: Is it that obvious?
PHLOX: Not at all. There's a notation in your medical file. Something
about an unfortunate incident during zero g training.
REED: The EV simulator at Lunaport, or as Starfleet trainees call it,
The Vomitorium.
PHLOX: Nothing to be embarrassed about. I've treated a number of
crewmen this afternoon for motion sickness. (Phlox gives him a hypospray.)
PHLOX: That should last for about twelve hours.
REED: Thank you, Doctor.
ARCHER: Feeling all right, Malcolm?
REED: Never better. (Reed leaves.)
ARCHER: Any problems with the crew?
PHLOX: Oh, a few bumps and bruises from the turbulence. Nothing too
serious. (Archer surveys the array of cages.)
ARCHER: I could see about moving some of
this to the aft section.
PHLOX: Nonsense. I have plenty of room. I find the close quarters
rather comforting. Reminds me of home.
ARCHER: I didn't realise space was at a premium on Denobula.
PHLOX: Twelve billion people sharing one continent.
ARCHER: Let me know if you change your mind.
 [Catwalk command area]
 ARCHER: Travis?
TRAVIS: We've got a cluster of plasma eddies about eighty thousand
kilometres ahead. I should be able to steer clear of them.
ARCHER: Wake me if there's a problem.
TRAVIS: Aye, Captain.
ARCHER: When we're past those eddies, try and get some rest yourself.
Ensign Tanner can relieve you.
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir. Good night.
ARCHER: Good night.
(bed is a mattress to the rear of the area, with T'Pol curled up
working on the other side of the room. Porthos joins his master for a
good petting session then trots back to his basket)
ARCHER: Go on. Go to sleep. (Archer turns on his PADD to watch a water polo
match, complete with sound and his own reactions. He feels T'Pol's
glare hitting him and looks up.)
ARCHER: Does this bother you?
T'POL: Only slightly.
(Archer turns off the PADD and settles down to sleep, but with the
light on and T'Pol tapping at her PADD, it's not easy.)
T'POL: Am I disturbing you?
ARCHER: Only slightly.
(She turns off her PADD and lies down.)
ARCHER: You know, there's a bright side to all of this.
T'POL: Really.
ARCHER: It's bringing the crew closer together. If you forget about the
storm outside, this is almost like going on a camping trip.
T'POL: Perhaps we can sing a few songs later.
ARCHER: Haven't you ever gone camping?
T'POL: In a manner of speaking. I once participated in the kahswan
ritual. I was taken to the desert and left to survive for ten days.
ARCHER: Sounds fun. You haven't left the command area much today. You
might want to wander around, get to know the crew.
T'POL: I'm familiar with every one of them.
ARCHER: There's a lot more to these people than just their names. It'd
be good for you to fraternise a little.
T'POL: Is that an order?
ARCHER: Does it have to be?
T'POL: I'm not skilled at fraternising.
ARCHER: Here's a chance to learn.(Tucker, Malcolm, Hoshi and Travis are playing
poker.)
REED: I'll see your strawberry shortcake, and I'll raise you one
pineapple cobbler.
(Hoshi puts down her bet.)
TRAVIS: Broccoli?
HOSHI: I'm out of desserts.
TRAVIS: Call.
REED: Oh, what I wouldn't give for a shower right about now. When this
hand's over maybe you could look into building one.
TUCKER: Would you like a sauna while I'm at it?
REED: You knew we'd be stuck in here for over a week. You might've
given it a little thought to making it tolerable.
TUCKER: I only had four hours, Malcolm. You're lucky we've got a
toilet.
REED: Well, I obviously overestimated your people's abilities when it
comes to indoor plumbing.
TUCKER: You want to take a shower? Build one yourself.
(A white suited figure comes by, handing out prepacked hot meals, but
we don't get to see his face.)
TUCKER: Thanks, Chef.
HOSHI: Thanks, Chef.
REED: Pot roast? Oh, come on. That's the third time in three days.
TRAVIS: Anyone know what they're showing tonight?
TUCKER: The Day the Earth Stood Still.
REED: We're having movie night in here?
TUCKER: Captain's orders. I set up a monitor in Compartment Five. The
screen's a little small, but
HOSHI: Who's picking these movies? Shouldn't we all get a vote?
TRAVIS: I think something's burning.
(Smoke is coming from the alien's area. Trip dashes over and pulls open
the blanket curtain to discover them cooking over a stove.)
TUCKER: Are you aware you're sitting on top of a plasma manifold? You
got to turn that thing off!
TAGRIM: I apologise, Commander. We should've spoken with you first.
TUCKER: That might've been a good idea.
RENTH: We've had trouble digesting your food.
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Tucker.
TUCKER: Go ahead.
ARCHER [OC]: I need you in the command area right away.
TUCKER: I'll be right there. (He picks up their pan loaded with -
something.) TUCKER: I'll talk to Chef. Maybe he can heat that up for you. (He hands
it off to Reed.)
 [Catwalk command area]
 ARCHER: We may have a problem in Engineering.
T'POL: The antimatter injectors have come online.
TUCKER: That can't be right. Probably just a glitch. Think you've got
room for one more sleeping bag in here?
ARCHER: Not happy with your bunk mates?
TUCKER: I caught them throwing a barbecue next to a plasma manifold.
Now, I understand we're explorers. We're supposed to keep an open mind
about different cultures, but these guys are driving me crazy. They
only need to sleep once a week, so they've kept us up the last two
nights with their strange rituals. Chanting, walking in circles.
They've practically taken over the compartment.
ARCHER: Don't forget they're the ones who warned us about the storm. We
owe them. Be patient.
TUCKER: I'm trying. Looks like the matter injectors and the antimatter
injectors are online.
ARCHER: Two sensor glitches?
T'POL: A power surge could've triggered both circuits.
TUCKER: Do you have any idea what the odds are of that happening?
ARCHER: Can you shut them down?
TUCKER: Not from here. Someone's going to have to go to Engineering.
 [Hatch into the rest of the ship]
 (Trip is in an EV suit.)
PHLOX: Remember, the suit will protect you for only twenty two minutes.
ARCHER: It'd be best not to take the scenic route.
(Tucker heads out into the darkened ship, and quickly gets to Engineering. Once there, he turns on a status monitor, them
notices a piece of equipment on the floor. He checks the injectors and
sees they have been tampered with. Then he hears someone else moving
around and turns off his lights, along with the monitor screen he had
activated. He hides and watches two figures moving around. The
intruders go to the injectors and do something, so Trip sets off an
alarm to distract them while he makes his escape. The aliens are not
wearing space suits, by the way. Out in a corridor, three more aliens
march past. They look as if they are in uniforms. Trip avoids them,
then goes to a porthole and looks out. There is a ship docked
alongside. He activates a monitor and calls up the Bridge security
camera. There are aliens there too, who look like the visitors in the
Catwalk.)
 [Ready room]
 (The person in charge is going through the crew
manifest on Archer's monitor.)
PALANTI: We've searched every deck. There's no sign of the fugitives.
CAPTAIN: What about the crew?
PALANTI: It appears they have deserted the ship.
CAPTAIN: These humans. They've travelled over a hundred light years
from their homeworld.
ARCHER [OC]: Captain's Starlog, February 9, 2152. The Vulcans have
allowed the Mazarites to leave. Ambassador V'Lar says there's a
CAPTAIN: Archer and his crew must've taken refuge in a nearby system.
They may intend to return. What's the status of the warp engines?
PALANTI: I'm having difficulty with the dilithium matrix.
CAPTAIN: Make it a priority. (Palanti leaves, and he returns to
the ships logs.)
ARCHER [OC]: 2152. We've responded to a distress call from a vessel in
the
 [Catwalk]
 (A crowd has gathered at the alien's area.)
PHLOX: They're immune to radiolytic isotopes. The storm was never any
threat to them.
TUCKER: Funny, you didn't mention that.
TAGRIM: We were in danger. Our ship is less durable than yours. We
would've been destroyed by the storm.
ARCHER: Who are they? What are they doing here?
TAGRIM: Captain, I assure you. We don't know these men.
ARCHER: They just happened to find Enterprise in the middle of a class
five neutronic storm? Where three members of their own species just
happened to be taking refuge?
T'POL: We're more than twenty light years from your homeworld. It's an
unlikely coincidence.
ARCHER: I get the feeling they must be looking for you. Answer me!
GURI: I told you we shouldn't have come here.
TAGRIM: Guri.
RENTH: They're officers of the Takret Militia. They've been pursuing us
for weeks. We thought we could evade them by hiding aboard your ship.
GURI: They must've detected our vessel in your launch bay.
ARCHER: What do they want with you?
RENTH: We used to be members of the militia, in the lower ranks, but
after a year we realised that the commanding officers were corrupt.
They seize alien vessels without provocation. They murder the crews,
take anything of value.
GURI: They're little more than criminals.
TAGRIM: We tried to resign our commissions but they wouldn't allow it.
ARCHER: You're deserters.
TAGRIM: We had no choice. We would've told you the truth, but we
weren't sure that you would help us.
RENTH: If they find us, we'll be executed.
TAGRIM: Captain, I apologise for the difficult position that we've put
you in, but I know these men. Even if they found us, I doubt they'd
simply leave. They've captured vessels far less impressive than yours.
REED: They're trying to re-initialise the warp reactor, sir. It seems
to me they've already decided to help themselves to Enterprise.
T'POL: They obviously don't realise we're in the catwalk. If they learn
we're here, it would undoubtedly endanger the crew.
TUCKER: What're you suggesting? We just sit on our hands until they
fire up the engines?
ARCHER: You're assuming these three are telling the truth. They've
already lied to us.
TAGRIM: We're not lying. These men are dangerous.
 [Engineering]
 PALANTI: Palanti to Captain.
 [Bridge]
 CAPTAIN: Yes.
PALANTI [OC]: The dilithium matrix is active.
 [Engineering]
 PALANTI: We're ready to initialise the warp
reactor.
CAPTAIN [OC]: Stand by.
 [Bridge]
(The Alien Captain is in Archer's chair.)  CAPTAIN: Do we have helm
control?
CREWMAN: The navigation relay's still not responding. I think they've
been re-routed.
CAPTAIN: How much longer?
CREWMAN: I'm not certain.
 [Engineering]
 CAPTAIN [OC]: Bring the warp engines online and
report to the Bridge.
PALANTI: Acknowledged.
 [Catwalk]
 T'POL: We may outnumber them, but we only have
three EV suits.
REED: I could take a security team and bring back more.
TUCKER: I doubt you'd get very far. The launch bay's crawling with
them.
ARCHER: Even if we could get the suits, we only have twenty two minutes
in the radiation. Hard to believe we could re-take the ship in that
(the group stops and stares as they see the warp engines coming on
line)
ARCHER: How long do we have?
TUCKER: It'll take a while for the warp coils to charge.
ARCHER: How long?
TUCKER: Twenty minutes, tops.
 [Hatch into rest of ship]
 (Archer, Reed and T'Pol are in EV suits.)
TUCKER: Remember, junction forty two alpha.
T'POL: Understood.
TUCKER: Third panel, starboard side. And be careful. There's a lot of
current running through those circuits. I really ought to be the one
doing this, Captain. The Doc said I was only out there for thirteen
minutes.
ARCHER: Forget it, Trip. You've already been exposed.
HOSHI: I've isolated your comm. frequencies. They won't hear a thing.
ARCHER: Tell Travis to wait for my signal.
 [Bridge]
 CAPTAIN: Any progress?
CREWMAN: Not yet. We could lose our ship by staying here. We should
take what we can and leave.
CAPTAIN: Keep working. I want helm control.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER: I'll see you back at the catwalk. Don't be
late.
REED: Aye, Captain.
(Archer heads off on his own to the Galley, and gets at a control panel
there.)
 [Catwalk command area]
 TUCKER: T'Pol?
T'POL [OC]: We're in position.
TUCKER: All right. First, you're going to have to disrupt the
antimatter stream.
 [Junction 42A]
 (An overhead panel is open.)
TUCKER [OC]: Do you see the blue conduit to the left of the power
transfer module?
REED: Go ahead.
 [Catwalk command area]
 TUCKER: Start by locking down the flow regulators.
 [Junction 42A]
 T'POL: Stand by.
 [Bridge]
 PALANTI: We're being hailed.
CAPTAIN: Another ship?
PALANTI: No. It's coming from within this vessel.
CAPTAIN: Answer it.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: (sounding as if he's dying) You're in my chair.
CAPTAIN: Captain Archer. I didn't realise you were still aboard.
Where's the rest of your crew?
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: They're dead, killed by the storm.
CAPTAIN: I'm sorry.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: Thanks for your condolences. Now, why don't you
get the hell off my ship.
CAPTAIN: I'm afraid I can't do that. We detected a vessel in your
launch bay that belongs to three fugitives.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: I've been watching you, I know you're trying to
take Enterprise. I'm not going to let you.
CAPTAIN: You're in no position to do anything about it. I'm in command
of this Bridge. Your vessel has been impounded under the authority of
the Takret Militia. When we return, you'll be charged with criminal
conspiracy.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: I don't recognise your authority. I answer to
Starfleet Command, and I'm under orders to use any means necessary to
keep my ship from falling into enemy hands.
CAPTAIN: I have soldiers searching every deck. It's only a matter of
time before they find you.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: You're leaving me no choice. I'll destroy
Enterprise.
CAPTAIN: Earth's first warp five starship? Your father's engine? I've
been reading about you, Captain, and I doubt very much if you'll do
anything to damage this vessel.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: You would be surprised. (ends transmission)
CAPTAIN: Can you trace his signal?
PALANTI: He's somewhere on the fifth deck.
CAPTAIN: You have men there. Alert them.
 [Catwalk command area]
 TUCKER: Go ahead.
ARCHER [OC]: (sounding very healthy) It's time to change course,
Travis. Head straight for that plasma eddy.
TRAVIS: It'll take a minute, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: Try and keep us in one piece. I'm on my way back. Archer
out.
(Archer goes back into the galley, and gets shot at. He takes cover and
returns fire)
 [Bridge]
 CREWMAN: We've altered course.
CAPTAIN: Where's he taking us?
 [Catwalk command area]
 TUCKER: What's the problem shutting down the
reactor?
 [Junction 42A]
 T'POL: We're having trouble with the dilithium
sequencers. It's taking longer than we expected.
TUCKER [OC]: I don't mean to rush you
 [Catwalk command area]
 TUCKER: But it's getting pretty warm in here.
(Archer's shooting match continues, and he gets one of the two
soldiers.)
 [Bridge]
 CREWMAN: He's steering us toward a plasma eddy.
CAPTAIN: How long?
CREWMAN: Less than eight minutes.
CAPTAIN: Get me helm control!
PALANTI: It'll take me much longer than that. We should evacuate.
CAPTAIN: No!
PALANTI: You heard what he said. He's willing to destroy his own ship.
 [Catwalk command area]
 TUCKER: The temperature just went up another six
degrees. Sub-Commander, how's it coming?
T'POL: We're disabling
 [Junction 42A]
 T'POL: The final sequencer.
 [Bridge]
 CREWMAN: The warp reactor has shut down.
PALANTI: Spatial disturbance. We're four minutes from the eddy.
(Everybody is hanging on in the turbulence as loose objects fall from
shelves.)
PALANTI: Unless you've found a way to turn this ship around I strongly
suggest we abort the mission.
CREWMAN: Three minutes.
CAPTAIN: Soldiers, report to the docking hatch immediately. I repeat,
report to the docking hatch!
(In the galley, the two pick up their fallen colleague and make their
exi.t)
 [Catwalk command area]
 T'POL: Report.
TRAVIS: We're too close to the eddy. We've got to veer off.
T'POL: Maintain your course.
(The militia ship undocks and flies away.)
TUCKER: Another one like that'll split us in two.
T'POL: They could still be on board.
TRAVIS: We've got no choice.
T'POL: Maintain your course. That's an order. (comm. beep) Go
ahead.
ARCHER [OC]: Travis, I hope you're not still heading for that eddy. Our
friends are gone.
T'POL: Ensign.
(Enterprise veers off into calmer space.)
 Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We seem to have
passed through the worst part of the storm, but it'll still be a while
before we can leave the catwalk. The crew's in relatively good spirits,
considering they haven't had a change of uniform in eight days.
 [Catwalk]
 (Movie night is a Western.)
TUCKER: Did that guy shoot one of his own men?
REED: It's hard to tell them apart in those ridiculous hats.
T'POL: The dead man was secretly working for Sheriff Boggs.
TUCKER: How do you know that?
T'POL: Isn't it obvious?
ARCHER [OC]: All hands, this is the Captain. Thanks to some fine
piloting by Travis Mayweather, we're going to be moving out of the
storm a little earlier than expected. We should be clear in a few
minutes.
(A round of applause and the house lights come up.)
TUCKER: Glad you could join us, Sub-Commander. We have movie night
every Tuesday, if you're interested.
(The ship sails out into black, star-speckled space and the crew return
to their own quarters again.)
 [Corridor]
 TAGRIM: I apologise for the trouble we've caused.
ARCHER: Where're you headed next?
TAGRIM: The Gyrannan System. We should be safe there.
ARCHER: Good luck.
T'POL: That's everyone.

 Original Airdate: 8 Jan, 2003
  [Shuttlepod]
 Tthe shuttlepod is flying through a very crowded
system and Tucker is in the back, doing something to a piece of
equipment.)
TUCKER: Chief Engineers log, supplemental. This turned out to be the
perfect spot to test the autopilot upgrades. The gas giant has dozens
of moons. It's like a gravitational jigsaw puzzle. Watch out, Travis.
These modifications are working so well, pretty soon we won't need
pilots anymore.
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Shuttlepod one.
TUCKER: Captain?
ARCHER [OC]: Looks like you're about to have some company, Trip.
Sensors are picking up a small (Fizzle, crackle.)
TUCKER: Say again, Captain. I'm picking up a lot of interference.
ARCHER [OC] There's a small vessel approaching your position.
(Tucker dashes to the pilot seat to see a small ship heading for him.)
TUCKER: This is Commander Charles Tucker. (It fires at him and passes
close overhead, then returns for another strafing run.) TUCKER: Tucker to
Enterprise. Mayday. I'm losing power. Mayday! If you can hear me, I'm
making an emergency landing, thrusters only. I take it back, Travis. I
could use a flesh and blood pilot right about now.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: Enterprise to Shuttlepod One. Commander
Tucker, do you read me?
TRAVIS: Malcolm?
REED: I detected weapons fire and then both ships just disappeared.
ARCHER: Last known position?
REED: Approximately fifty thousand kilometres, bearing zero zero
three mark two seven, I think. I can't be more specific. It's the
damned interference.
T'POL: Many of these moons have atmospheres that contain selenium
isotopes. That's most likely what's affecting our sensors.
ARCHER: Trip's a good pilot. If he was near one of those moons he most
likely set down on it. How many are there?
T'POL: Sixty two.
ARCHER: Then we'd better start looking. Travis.
TRAVIS: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: We'll scan every moon, even if we have to do it with
binoculars. Keep hailing him.
 [Shuttlepod]
 (Tucker opens the hatch and comes out into a night
scene with insects chirping. There's rock and a dead tree. He goes back
inside to tend to his scratches and record events to date.)
TUCKER: Chief Engineer's Log, supplemental. For the record, I was
attacked by a small craft. I don't know what I did to provoke him.
Something in this moon's atmosphere neutralised my engines. I was
forced to make an emergency landing. Looks like I took some damage on
impact. Main power's still offline. I don't think I'll be flying out of
here. First things first. I'll try and get the transceiver working,
contact the Enterprise.
 [Moon]
 (Working outside next to a campfire, but his
fingers are still very cold and they slip,)
TUCKER: Damn it.
(He blows on them to try and get some feeling back. There's a noise in
the shrubs and he leaves the transceiver to go and investigate,
carrying a torch and a large metal bar-like tool. Suddenly there's
weapon fire and he falls to the ground. A big alien is shouting
something and shooting at him. Tucker dives into the shuttlepod for cover
and closes the hatch. He looks out towards the campfire to see -)
TUCKER: Son of a bitch stole my transceiver.
 [Bridge]
 (Another ship has arrived at the gas giant.)
ARCHER: Who are they?
T'POL: An Arkonian military vessel.
ARCHER: You've dealt with them?
T'POL: No, but I'm aware of their reputation. If we're in their
territory, we should proceed with extreme caution.
HOSHI: They're hailing us.(A grey skinned alien with aggressive bony
ridges radiating out across the face from the bridge of his nose.)
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: You
are on an unauthorised course. Leave immediately.
ARCHER: And you are?
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: Captain Khata'n Zshaar. I have orders to
destroy any vessel that violates our territory.
ARCHER: I'm Captain Jonathan Archer of the Starship Enterprise. We
weren't aware that this system was claimed by anyone.
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: Why is there a Vulcan on your bridge?
ARCHER: Sub-Commander T-Pol is my Science Officer.
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: Turn your ship around.
ARCHER: A member of my crew is missing. We believe he exchanged weapons
fire with a small vessel. Was it one of yours?
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: We sent a patrol ship to intercept your
shuttle. We have also lost contact.
ARCHER: Then maybe we can look for them together. Once we've recovered
our crewman we'll be more than happy to leave.
ZSHAAR [on viewscreen]: If your shuttle did encounter my patrol ship,
your crewman is already dead.
ARCHER: Either way, we're not going anywhere until we know what
happened. Now it seems to me we have a similar problem. Two missing
people and sixty two moons. It'll go a lot faster if we use both our
ships to co-ordinate the search. The sooner we get started, the sooner
we'll be out of your territory. [Shuttlepod]
  (Tucker has gone out scouting for the thief. He
locates another crashed pod and campfire, but makes a noise as his foot
slips on some gravel. The alien hasn't heard him, so Tucker makes his way
back to his own pod to try and continue repairs.)TUCKER: It's him. I recognise his shuttlecraft. He
seems about as bad off as I am. Whatever knocked out my engines
probably did the same to his. If I'd brought a Universal Translator
along, I'd be able to explain to this guy that I'm just trying to get
out of here like he is. One piece of good news. It's starting to warm
up a little. Dawn is coming.
 [Alien campfire]
 (The alien pilot is struggling with the stolen
transceiver, and scratching his head.)
TUCKER [OC]: I'm coming out now. Please don't fire. I want to talk. I'm
unarmed.
(The alien heads off in the direction of the voice, and Tucker sneaks in
from the opposite side to get his transceiver and do something to it.)
TUCKER [OC]: We need to talk. You have something that belongs to me. I
want it back. If you understand anything that I'm saying to you, I want
you to listen very, very closely. Mary had a little lamb. Its fleece
was white as snow. (The alien discovers a PADD and speaker in a tree.)
TUCKER [OC]: And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go. (The alien
dashes back to his camp, tripping an alarm on the way so Tucker has time
to hide. He leaves the transceiver behind. The alien comes looking for
him, Tucker knocks the gun out of his hand. They wrestle briefly until
Tucker manages to snatch it up.)
TUCKER: Now, maybe we can introduce ourselves.
ZHO'KAAN: (something)
TUCKER: Nice to meet you, too. Now, I don't want to hurt you. I just
want my transceiver back.
(The alien says something, then manages to knock Tucker's feet out from
under him, grab the gun and shoot him. Later, the alien is trying to work on the transceiver to no avail. He
goes over to Tucker and kicks him awake.)
TUCKER: I'm no good until I've had my coffee.
(The alien hauls him to his feet and gestures towards the equipment,
saying something.)
TUCKER: You wouldn't have a Universal Translator on you?
ZHO'KAAN: (shouts)
TUCKER: I don't understand a word you're saying! (Zho'Kaan lets go of him and mutters towards the transceiver.)
TUCKER: I can't make it work. It's broken. You know, broken. I was
trying to make repairs when you stole it.
(Zho'Kaan implyes that Tucker should mend it then.)
TUCKER: What?
ZHO'KAAN: Kushka roatta.
TUCKER: You want me to fix your transceiver. (The alien jerks his head.)
TUCKER: Is that a yes or a no?
ZHO'KAAN: Kushka.
TUCKER: Kushka to you, too. (Zho'Kaan pulls a gun on him,)
TUCKER: You kill me and I can't fix anything. You're going to have to
untie me. I need my hands.
ZHO'KAAN: (softly, threateningly)
TUCKER: I try anything, I'm a dead man. I get the message. (The alien
unties his wrists.)
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Any progress?
T'POL: We've searched five of the moons. No sign of Commander Tucker or
the Arkonian ship.
ARCHER: And the Arkonians?
T'POL: It appears they've made no progress either. They're continuing
to search the moons they agreed to.
ARCHER: This is their territory. They could have called for more ships
to help search.
T'POL: I'm afraid they don't trust us. Primarily because I'm a Vulcan.
ARCHER: What's the bad blood?
T'POL: We made First Contact nearly a hundred years ago, not long after
the Arkonians developed warp drive. But from the beginning, our
relations were difficult. Your people accepted Vulcan guidance, opened
diplomatic and cultural exchanges. The Arkonians were suspicious and
deceitful. Eventually, the High Command withdrew its contingent.
ARCHER: Well, maybe we'll have better luck with them.
T'POL: It doesn't appear promising.
ARCHER: They agreed to work with us.
T'POL: For now. I'd advise you to remain cautious. Arkonians are
unpredictable. They're prone to hostility.
T'POL: I'll keep that in mind. Let me know when we reach the next moon.
 [Alien's campfire]
 (There's enough light coming over the horizon for
Tucker to turn off his torch. The alien is watching as he tries to
connect a piece of equipment to an aerial, and gets an electric shock.)
TUCKER: Damn it.
ZHO'KAAN: Damn.
TUCKER: Well, looks like we've made some headway in our First Contact
between humans and whatever you are. Unfortunately, your first word is
something you wouldn't want to use in polite company. (Zho'Kaan says something then gestures towards Tucker.)
ZHO'KAAN: Damn it.
TUCKER: No. I'm Trip. (slaps his chest) Trip.
ZHO'KAAN: Trip. (touches his chest) Zho'Kaan.
TUCKER: Zho'Kaan. Great. Now that we've been properly introduced, how
about some water, Zho'Kaan? It's getting kind of hot. Thirsty. You
know. Drink. Water. (Tucker makes the universal drinking gesture. Zho'Kaan throws him a flask.) ZHO'KAAN: Trip.
TUCKER: Thanks. (Tucker takes a sip then spits it out and throws the flask
away.) TUCKER: What the hell is that?
(Zho'Kaan says something as he scrabbles for the spilling liquid and takes
a drink himself.)
TUCKER: Sorry. I have water in my shuttle. Water. Something I can
drink.
(Later, Trip is down to his singlet and struggling with the alien tech.
He pulls at a wire and falls, cutting himself.)
TUCKER: There's a medkit in my shuttlepod. (Zho'Kaan sprays saliva onto the cut.) TUCKER: What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy? (The cut heals quickly
and perfectly.) TUCKER: That was quite a trick.
ZHO'KAAN: Drat. Drat komacha. (He gestures Trip to get back to work.)
TUCKER: All right, all right. I can't fix this thing. It's a lost
cause. Maybe if you vomit on it, it'll fix itself. Come over here. I
want you to see this. Here. Come here. It's like talking to Porthos.
See this? I tried bypassing the induction coil, but it didn't work.
See? In here. (As Zho'Kaan leans over, Trip pulls out a tube and
something sprays into the alien's face, sending him reeling in pain.
Tucker gets the weapon.) TUCKER: I can't fix this. I need to get back to my ship.
My ship. Now, pick 'em up. Pick them up!
(Zho'Kaan snarls.)
TUCKER: Same to you. Now, let's get going.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: What have you got?
T'POL: See for yourself. (A diagram of the moons orbiting the gas
giant, with colours.)
ARCHER: I'll need a little help here.
T'POL: It's a thermo-kinetic analysis of e moons. Each of them
undergoes extreme temperature variations during their orbits.
ARCHER: Go on.
T'POL: At night, it can drop to five or even ten degrees below zero.
ARCHER: Doesn't sound so bad.
T'POL: During the day, the temperature can rise to as high as one
hundred and seventy degrees.
ARCHER: We'd better hope that Trip landed on the night side.
T'POL: And that we find him before the sun rises.
 [Trip's campfire]
 (Tucker is tying Zho'Kaan hand and foot.)
TUCKER: Don't give me that look. You started this. (He takes a long
drink of water then rummages in the ration packs.) TUCKER: You want some food?
Food. (Zho'Kaan takes a bite then spits it out.)
ZHO'KAAN: Nohkto.
TUCKER: Nohkto. I couldn't agree more.
ZHO'KAAN: (something)
TUCKER: You want food from your ship? V'dhoze, that means food?
ZHO'KAAN: V'dhoze.
TUCKER: V'dhoze, ship.
ZHO'KAAN: Ship.
TUCKER: Yeah. Sorry, but breakfast is going to have to wait. I've
figured out a way to get us out of here. I got a pretty good look at
your comm. configuration back there. I think I can cannibalise the
power supply from your transceiver and use it to get mine working.
Maybe get a message off.
(A little later, the sun is slowly rising higher in the sky.)
TUCKER: Got it. Almost there. I think this is going to work.
ZHO'KAAN: Nohkto.
TUCKER: No, not nohkto. Good.
ZHO'KAAN: Good.
TUCKER: That's right. We're getting out of here. Once we get back to
Enterprise and we can finally understand each other, the first words
out of your mouth had better be thank you. (He gets an electrical short
from the transceiver, and Zho'Kaan hisses with merriment.) TUCKER: You think
that's funny? (He puts some commands into a PADD attached to the device,
and it comes to life.) TUCKER: You going to laugh now? Tucker to Enterprise.
Enterprise, do you read me? Come on, Hoshi. Tucker to Enterprise. This
terrain, it's all volcanic. Igneous rock is heavy in diamagnetic
minerals. It's interfering with the transmission. I think I know what
we need to do. The transceiver, the tsunsana. It's bad down here.
Nohkto. But if we take it to higher ground we could avoid some of the
interference. I'm going to need help. You and me, together. (Tucker takes the
gun and throws it away.) TUCKER: See? I'm not going to hurt you, and you are not
going to hurt me. We'll work together.
(Zho'Kaan jerks his head and holds out his bound wrists. Tucker unties his feet.)
TUCKER: Before we start, we'll get some food from
your ship. Your v'dhoze.
(As soon as his hands are free, Zho'Kaan attacks Tucker. They wrestle,
Zho'Kaan goes after the gun but Tucker gets it away from him.) TUCKER: Easy.
(Zho'Kaan sprays that saliva stuff into his face. They trade punches,
Zho'Kaan gets a strangle hold on Tucker but gets smashed in the face by a
rock for his efforts. Finally they give up, exhausted by heat and
effort.) TUCKER: Is that the best you can do? (Trip retrieves the gun and throws
it away again.) TUCKER: We can fight some more if you want, or we can try to get
the hell out of here. What's it going to be?
(The pair of them carry the equipment up a rocky, sunlit cliff.) TUCKER: Come
on.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: Captain, I'm picking up a transmission.
ARCHER: Trip?
HOSHI: I can't tell yet. I'm trying to get a lock.
[Deleted scene]
TUCKER [OC]: Respond. Mayday. Enterprise. Anybody. Please respond.
 [Ready room]
 ZSHAAR: We never received a call.
ARCHER: It was transmitted on a Starfleet frequency.
ZSHAAR: You told me these moons are dangerous. So why haven't you
rescued your pilot?
ARCHER: That's why I asked you here. The message was in a Starfleet
frequency, but we think the carrier wave was generated by your
technology. We weren't able to respond. If we can't isolate the wave we
won't be able to rescue either of them. My science officer believes she
can recalibrate your scanners to isolate our frequencies. Then you can
pinpoint their location.
ZSHAAR: If I allowed a Vulcan access to an Arkonian ship, I'd be
executed.
ARCHER: Then send your science officer over here. T'Pol can show him
what to do. It seems my engineer and your pilot have found a way to
work together. 
 [Cliff face]
 (Zho'Kaan looks in a bad way and Trip is stripped
to the waist.)
TUCKER: Chief Engineer's log, supplemental. It's been two hours since
we started signaling the Enterprise. No response yet. The sun's not
even up yet and it's already hotter than hell. My sparring partner
doesn't look too good. I can't be sure, but I don't think his species
can sweat. For the record, I have learned one thing about him. His
name's Zho'Kaan. Anything you want to say to the folks back home?
ZHO'KAAN: Nohkto.
TUCKER: That means bad. You'd be proud of me, Hoshi. I've picked up
about a dozen words in his language. A couple of them are real
tongue-twisters. (He unscrews the top from Zho'Kaan's flask so he can
drink.)
ZHO'KAAN: (something)
(The sun has risen over the mountains straight in front of them.
Zho'Kaan tries to crawl into what little shade there is. Later -)
TUCKER: Hey. Zho'Kaan. (he lifts his head slightly) I though I lost you
there.
ZHO'KAAN: Tsunsana. Enterprise krnat?
TUCKER: No. No Enterprise.
ZHO'KAAN: Damn it. (He has the last of his drink.)
TUCKER: Don't worry. I'll get Phlox to cook up a new batch for you once
we're aboard Enterprise. He's great with that kind of thing. Stay with
me, Zho'Kaan. Gan tak. Don't die on me now, understand? All right.
HOSHI [OC]: Enterprise.
TUCKER: See? I told you. Hoshi, is that you?
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER [OC]: Do you read me?
ARCHER: We read you, Trip.
TUCKER [OC]: You're just in time, Captain. It's starting to get a
little hot down here.
ARCHER: We're getting a lock on your position now.
TUCKER [OC]: Don't send a shuttlepod.
 [Moon]
 TUCKER: There's something in this atmosphere
that'll affect the engines.
ARCHER [OC]: it's selenium isotopes, but we don't think it will
interfere with the transporter.
TUCKER: I'm not alone, Captain.
ARCHER [OC]: We know. The Arkonians helped us find you. How are you and
their pilot getting along?
TUCKER: Uh, just like old friends. I'm a little worried, though. He's
gotten very dehydrated.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Stand by, Trip. (to Reed) Prepare the
transporter.
PHLOX: I wouldn't do that, Captain.
ARCHER: What's the problem?
PHLOX: I've been analysing the Arkonians' physiology. Their endocrine
system is extremely sensitive to temperature fluctuations. If that
pilot is suffering from dehydration, it's no doubt causing an acute
cellular breakdown.
ARCHER: Meaning?
PHLOX: Transporting him will most likely be fatal.
 [Cliff face]
 ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: I'm still here, Captain.
ARCHER [OC]: Trip, we can bring you aboard but we can't transport the
Arkonian. Doctor Phlox says it will kill him. We'll try to find a way
to get him back to his ship.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: But in the meantime, I'm getting you out
of there.
TUCKER [OC]: No way, Captain. I'm not leaving him here.
T'POL: The surface temperature is rising quickly, Commander. I estimate
it will reach one hundred thirty degrees within the next hour.
ARCHER: Let's get you home.
 [Cliff face]
 ARCHER [OC]: Then we'll worry about your friend.
TUCKER: I'm sorry, sir, but I can't do that.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER [OC]: Maybe there's another way.
 [Cliff face]
 TUCKER: We know our pods can't make it, but I got
a good look at the circuitry inside the Arkonian shuttle. One of theirs
could be modified.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: How?
TUCKER [OC]: If they take a look at their intake manifolds
 [Cliff face]
 TUCKER: I think they could realign them to filter
out the isotopes.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: We'll talk to them, but I won't let you
stay down there much longer.
 [Cliff face]
 TUCKER: Understood.
ARCHER [OC]: Archer out.
(A little later, and sweat is visibly pouring off Tucker. Why isn't it
evaporating?)
TUCKER: Tucker to Enterprise. Enterprise, respond. Some of these relays
have fused. Must be the heat. Hey. Gan tak. (He pours some water on
Zho'Kaan to wake him, then takes a drink.) TUCKER: I don't suppose the
Captain'll trust me to go out on my own for a while. I wouldn't be
surprised if he knocked me down to steward. Your orange juice, sir. Jam
or marmalade, sir? But I tell you I wouldn't trade my time on
Enterprise. Not for anything. I've seen things I could never imagine
back home. I saw the Great Plume of Agosoria and I saw the ringed moons
of Matalas Prime. And I stood on an asteroid crater twice as high as
Everest, and went diving in the ice caves of Etheenia. Rode in a
Suliban cell ship. Spent the night, I spent the night with a princess.
Oh, and I even got pregnant once. Now there's a story. I'm sure you
have stories, too. That's why we chose this life, right? See things
we've never seen before. Hell of a ride, though. Hell of a ride. (Then he sees
something in the glare.) TUCKER: Zho'Kaan. V'dhoze.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in. (T'Pol and Zshaar enter.) ARCHER: I just
got a report from my doctor. Your pilot's responding well. He'll be
ready to go home in a few hours.
ZSHAAR: And your crewman?
ARCHER: He's tired and a bit sunburned, but he's doing fine.
ZSHAAR: If I discover that my pilot fired on your shuttle without
provocation, he'll be disciplined.
ARCHER: It was a misunderstanding. I hope we can avoid them in the
future.
ZSHAAR: I expect you to leave this system immediately, as agreed.
(Zshaar leaves.)
ARCHER: I guess we won't be adding the Arkonians to our list of
friends.
T'POL: The encounter was less volatile than I expected. You managed to
establish better relations in a single day than the Vulcans have in a
century.
ARCHER: Let's hope it stays that way.
 [Sickbay]
 TUCKER: How's he doing?
PHLOX: Why don't you ask him yourself? The Universal Translator is
online.
TUCKER: They told me another ten minutes of sunshine, and we'd have
been cooked.
ZHO'KAAN: Tarattaash.
TUCKER: I thought you said the UT was working.
ZHO'KAAN: I believe you promised me some Tarattaash. (Zho'Kaan makes the universal drinking gesture.)
TUCKER: You mean the brown stuff you were drinking? Won't take a
minute. Anything else while I'm at it? Our chef is making something
called chicken Marsala tonight.
ZHO'KAAN: Tarat
TUCKER: Tarattaash. Got you.
ZHO'KAAN: Trip. When I fired at your vessel. I'm grateful I didn't
destroy it.
TUCKER: That makes two of us.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Stigma
Stigma
 Original Airdate: 5 Feb, 2003
  [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: Your neurolytic enzymes are considerably
higher than last month.
T'POL: The treatment's no longer effective?
PHLOX: I told you it was just a matter of time before we'd need
supplemental medications. This conference is a perfect opportunity.
Some of your finest physicians will be there. It's essential that I
speak with them.
T'POL: It's too great a risk. I'd be taken off Enterprise.
PHLOX: I think I can question them without revealing that you're
infected.
T'POL: It's too great a risk.
PHLOX: I'm afraid we have no choice. Without further treatment, you
could very possibly die.
 Captain's Starlog Supplemental: We've entered
orbit of Dekendi Three where the Interspecies Medical Exchange is
hosting a conference. We'll be picking up a neutron microscope, but
more importantly, we'll get a chance to meet one of Phlox's wives.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER: How long's it been, Doc?
PHLOX: Oh, I haven't seen Feezal for nearly four years.
TUCKER: What's the point of having three wives if you never get to see
them?
PHLOX: Denobulans are renowned for their patience. (The air lock door opens
to reveal a petite blonde in a bright pink outfit.) PHLOX: Welcome, my beloved!(They embrace by almost but not quite touching.)
FEEZAL: My beloved.
PHLOX: Captain Archer, I'd like you to meet my second wife, Feezal.
ARCHER: It's a pleasure to have you aboard.
FEEZAL: Thank you.
PHLOX: And this is our Chief Engineer, Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: Ma'am.
FEEZAL: I look forward to helping you install the microscope.
ARCHER: We can hold that off till later. I'm sure the two of you are
eager to spend some time together.
PHLOX: Nonsense, Captain. We've been apart for four years. Another
hour, another day. As I said, we're very patient.
ARCHER: Well in that case, why don't we have some lunch while the
microscope's being unloaded?
FEEZAL: I'd be honoured. (Phlox leads the way.) FEEZAL: Won't you be joining us,
Commander?
TUCKER: I'd love to, but I think I should make sure your equipment gets
up to Sickbay in one piece.
FEEZAL: Then I'll see you after lunch?
TUCKER: You bet.
 [Conference centre]
 YURIS: It seems odd, doesn't it, that a Denobulan
physician would be interested in a Vulcan disease.
PHLOX: One of my colleagues on Denobula has been studying Pa'nar
Syndrome for some time. Its pathology is quite similar to thymic
sclerosis.
STROMM: Thymic sclerosis?
PHLOX: It's a nonfatal illness which we've had very little success
treating. I promised him, my colleague back home, that I'd inquire about
any recent advances in its treatment.
ORATT: We're hesitant to discuss Pa'nar Syndrome, Doctor. This illness
is unique to a subculture, a small percentage of our population. Their
behaviour is neither tolerated nor sanctioned.
PHLOX: My friend is well aware of that. Unfortunately, thymic sclerosis
is found in all strata of Denobulan society. Developing a cure is of
paramount importance.
YURIS: Do you have any literature on this disease?
PHLOX: As I told you, I'm currently serving on a Starfleet vessel.
Humans are not susceptible to it. I could contact my colleague but it
would take at least five days before we'd receive a response.
STROMM: I'm afraid we'll have returned to Vulcan by then.
PHLOX: Anything you could provide me with would be instrumental in
helping the Denobulan people.
ORATT: We'll have to discuss your request, Doctor. When we've reached a
decision, we'll contact you aboard your ship.
PHLOX: Thank you for your time.
 [Sickbay]
 TUCKER: If the reflectometer is supposed to
amplify the neutron stream, shouldn't it be installed before the
emitters?
FEEZAL: It's collimating the neutrons, not amplifying them. If you read
the instructions, you'll find it's all very clear.
TUCKER: Oh, I've tried to read the instructions, and they are anything
but clear. I don't want to brag, but I can take apart and put back
together just about any piece of equipment I've ever met. It's one of
the reasons Captain Archer picked me for this mission, because I'm
really good at following instructions. But these are in
FEEZAL: Denobulan. I understand. That's why I'm here. So let's go
through it slowly. Do you see the threads on the aperture ring?
TUCKER: Here.
FEEZAL: Exactly. Take the smaller condenser lens and screw it on. Now
remodulate the emitter frequency. That'll initiate the neutron stream.
TUCKER: Which one? (She is right up close against him as she leans
across to pick up a piece of equipment.) TUCKER: You're going to have to help me
with this one.
FEEZAL: It's very simple. Insert the thick end into this opening. It'll
automatically programme the frequency. You can pull it out now. The
stream should be initiated.
TUCKER: I think I'm getting the hang of it. Maybe if you explain the
next few steps, I could try and get through some of this on my own.
(He makes a little distance between them.)
FEEZAL: By all means. You're a very confident young man, aren't you?
TUCKER: I try to be.
FEEZAL: You're going to need to come a little closer to see this.
 [Captain's mess]
 ARCHER: Have you spoken to Phlox since he got back?
T'POL: I wasn't aware he was gone.
ARCHER: You must've not seen him yesterday morning. He was champing at
the bit to get down to that conference. Brought back a wish list of
medical instruments.
T'POL: It is the first I.M.E. conference he's attended in over a year.
ARCHER: He said there was a Vulcan contingent. You might want to go
down for a visit. You may know one of them.
T'POL: There are over one million physicians on Vulcan.
ARCHER: I would think you'd enjoy spending time with members of your
own species. (comm. beep) Archer.
HOSHI [OC]: A Vulcan transport has requested permission to dock, sir.
They've already left the surface.
ARCHER: Speak of the devil. Looks like you won't have to go anywhere.
I'll meet them at Docking port two.
HOSHI [OC]: They've asked that the doctor join you, and Sub-Commander
T'Pol.
ARCHER: Let him know, okay?
HOSHI [OC]: Right away, sir.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER: You have any idea what this is about?
T'POL: I haven't spoken to anyone on the surface.
ARCHER: You can bet they're not coming up for coffee and doughnuts.
 [Conference room]
 (The three Vulcan doctors sit down along one side
of a table.)
ARCHER: Can I get you something? Thanks to Sub-Commander T'Pol, our
chef has learned to make some pretty decent Plomeek soup.
ORATT: We appreciate your hospitality, Captain, but we've come to speak
to your doctor, with your permission.
ARCHER: Absolutely. If you need anything, just let me know. (He turns to
leave.)
ORATT: We would appreciate it if T'Pol would remain.
ARCHER: Sub-Commander.
(Phlox and T'Pol sit opposite the Vulcans, as Archer leaves.)
ORATT: We've discussed your request. Unfortunately, we are still
hesitant to share data regarding Pa'nar Syndrome.
PHLOX: Sub-Commander T'Pol is not aware of my request. I'm curious why
you asked her to stay.YURIS: You're requesting information about a Vulcan disease, and you
didn't discuss it with your Vulcan Science Officer?
PHLOX: That's correct. As far as I know, her expertise does not include
medicine.
ORATT: Are you familiar with Pa'nar Syndrome, Sub-Commander?
T'POL: Of course.
ORATT: Would you mind describing it?
T'POL: You are physicians. Why would you need me to define an illness?
ORATT: Please, indulge us.
T'POL: It's an incurable degradation of the synaptic pathways. It also
affects the endocrine and immune systems.
STROMM: An impressive definition. Could you tell us how the disease is
transmitted?
T'POL: Through a telepathic practice.
ORATT: And what practice would that be?
T'POL: Mind-melds. They cause a disruption of neuroelectric impulses in
the mid-brain, which can lead to the early stages of the syndrome.
STROMM: Do you condone these acts, Sub-Commander? These mind-melds?
T'POL: I'd appreciate it if you'd tell me why you asked me here.
PHLOX: As would I. Your questions to T'Pol seem inappropriate.
ORATT: Doctor Phlox has asked for data regarding the treatment of
Pa'nar Syndrome. Did you have anything to do with that request?
PHLOX: I believe I was very clear about that.
STROMM: Yes, your colleague on Denobula. Forgive us Doctor, but since
there's a Vulcan serving on your ship, a fact that you neglected to
mention to us, we had to consider other possible motives for you
inquiry.
PHLOX: What motive are you suggesting?(Stromm hands a PADD to T'Pol.)
STROMM: Are you familiar with any of these
names?
T'POL: They're Vulcan. I'm not familiar with any of them.
STROMM: They're melders. Vulcans with the ability to transfer thoughts
and memories to each other. Do you know any melders, Sub-Commander?
T'POL: Not well, but I've met a number of them.
STROMM: Then I'll ask you again. Do you condone their behaviour?
T'POL: I don't understand what your questions have to do with the
Doctor's request.
ORATT: We find their behaviour unacceptable, and since Pa'nar Syndrome
is transmitted by these people, its cure is not a priority.
PHLOX: Are you saying there is no additional research?
ORATT: None that we'd care to disseminate. I'm sorry.
T'POL: You travelled up from the surface to tell Doctor Phlox you
wouldn't help him?
ORATT: If you'll please show us to the airlock.
 [Vulcan medical area]
 (The PADD T'Pol handled is scanned, and the
results of her DNA analysis studied on a monitor.)
YURIS: Is it definitive?
STROMM: Unmistakably. She's suffering from the syndrome.
 [Sickbay]
 (The neutron microscope is up and running. Phlox
is working in the background.)
FEEZAL: Now watch. A simple strand of protein molecules can be enlarged
and enhanced to where we can clearly see a single nucleotide.
TUCKER: Amazing. Look at that. Are those?
FEEZAL: Carbon atoms. Now you try it.
TUCKER: First I reinitialise the neutron stream.
FEEZAL: Precisely. Very good. Now align the quantum filters.
TUCKER: This is a bitch.
FEEZAL: Excuse me?
TUCKER: Oh, not you. The microscope.
PHLOX: Has Vesna forgiven Groznik yet?
FEEZAL: Absolutely not. Groznik has only apologised twice. I doubt
he'll be forgiven for another two years.
PHLOX: Well, at least he has his other wives.
FEEZAL: Not wives, wife. Kessil moved to Teerza Prime to be with her
third husband.
TUCKER: Did I do this right? Why is there no image?
FEEZAL: You forgot to enter the frequency parameters.
PHLOX: Which one was her third husband? Oh, was that Klaban?
FEEZAL: Bogga. Klaban was Forlisa's husband. Her first, I think.(Tucker gets an image on the monitor.)
TUCKER: There you go. Why isn't it sharp?
FEEZAL: You forgot to stabilise the aperture. That's just a reflection
of the imaging filament. That's all right. (She puts a reassuring hand on
his shoulder.) FEEZAL: We'll reinitialise the neutron stream and start again.
PHLOX: Forlisa. Forlisa. Oh, my, my. (He joins them.) PHLOX: I thought about
asking Forlisa to be my second wife. Turned out she already had three
husbands.
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Doctor Phlox.
PHLOX: Yes, Captain.
ARCHER [OC]: Could you report to my ready room?
PHLOX: Certainly. I'll be back as soon as I can, my beloved. Commander.
(Feezal still has her hand on Tucker's shoulder, and is smiling at him.)
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in.
(Phlox and T'Pol enter.)
PHLOX: Yes, Captain.
ARCHER: I wanted to see both of you. It's been a while since I was
embarrassed by a Vulcan dignitary.
PHLOX: Sir?
ARCHER: I just spoke to Doctor Oratt. It seems you requested some
medical data regarding a Vulcan illness for a colleague on Denobula.
PHLOX: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: And both of you said that T'Pol had nothing to do with that
request. Are you both going to lie to me like you lied to them?
PHLOX: I have no intention of lying to you, Captain.
ARCHER: And when were you going to tell me that you've contracted a
serious illness?
T'POL: Sir?
ARCHER: They handed you something. A PADD, I think. Does that ring a
bell? You left a fingerprint. It was enough for them to run tests. Why
did you lie to them?
T'POL: It's none of their concern.
ARCHER: It sure as hell is if they can help you. (to Phlox) How long
have you known about this?
PHLOX: Nearly a year.
ARCHER: And you never thought that maybe you should come to me and let
me know that one of my officers has a potentially fatal disease?
PHLOX: I believe your culture embraces the concept of doctor-patient
confidentiality.
T'POL: The disease is not contagious. If we had told you there's
nothing you could have done.
ARCHER: You still haven't explained to me why you lied to the Vulcans.
And why would you think they would be more apt to help you if you said
it was for a Denobulan colleague?
PHLOX: Pa'nar syndrome is an illness that carries a stigma on Vulcan.
T'POL: If the High Command was to learn that I was infected, I would
most likely lose my commission.
ARCHER: For having a disease?
T'POL: It's not about the disease. It's about the people who are
capable of transmitting it.
ARCHER: Go on.
T'POL: There are certain Vulcans, a small minority, who are born with
the ability to perform a very intimate form of telepathy.
ARCHER: Intimate?
T'POL: A melding of minds.
ARCHER: That ship of Vulcans who were experimenting with emotions.
T'POL: They are part of the telepathic minority. One of the reasons why
they left Vulcan was to escape prejudice. Their behaviour is considered
unnatural. They're seen as a threat.
ARCHER: You belong to that minority?
T'POL: No.
ARCHER: Then?
PHLOX: Only members of the minority can initiate a mind-meld, but any
Vulcan can be the recipient.
ARCHER: Why would you take that risk?
T'POL: It wasn't by choice. One of the men on that ship.
ARCHER: You were attacked. I remember. I'm sure the High Command will
understand.
T'POL: I have no intention of telling them.
ARCHER: Why not?
T'POL: I have my reasons.
ARCHER: How serious is it?
PHLOX: I've kept it in check, but the symptoms have progressed. That's
why I requested the most current research.
ARCHER: Well, your request was accompanied by a lie, and whatever your
reasons might have been, you're no longer welcome at the conference.
The Vulcans have seen to that.
PHLOX: I understand.
ARCHER: My number one priority here is the health of my first officer.
If these doctors have data that can help her, I plan to get it.
(A shuttlepod launches.)
 [Vulcan medical area]
 (Archer is getting impatient in the waiting room
when Yuris and Stromm arrive.)
STROMM: I'm sorry, did we keep you waiting?
ARCHER: Actually, you did.
STROMM: What can we do for you, Captain?
ARCHER: Sub-Commander T'Pol and my doctor have explained the situation
to me.
STROMM: It's unfortunate that T'Pol is ill.
ARCHER: Doctor Phlox assures me that he was only trying to protect her
privacy. He doesn't make a habit of lying.
STROMM: I certainly hope not.
ARCHER: I'm having a little difficulty understanding why you won't
share your research, especially now that you know it could help T'Pol's
condition. I can't believe you're withholding it to punish Doctor Phlox.
STROMM: Our decision has nothing to do with that.
ARCHER: Then what does it have to do with?
STROMM: Pa'nar syndrome is a disease that's unique to an undesirable
segment of our population. Thankfully, there are very few of them.
ARCHER: And because you find them undesirable they're not entitled to
medical care?
STROMM: We don't condone the intimate acts that these people engage in.
They defy everything our society stands for.
ARCHER: Intimate acts? You're talking about mind-melds.
STROMM: We take great pride in our ability to contain emotions. Sharing
them is offensive. Now if you'll excuse me, we have a great deal of
work to do before the conference ends.
ARCHER: If you're not going to help her the least you could do is show
a little discretion. The High Command doesn't need to know about this.
STROMM: It's not for us to decide what the High Command needs to know.
ARCHER: You have her genetic profile. You must realise she's not a
member of this minority.
STROMM: Nonetheless, there's only one way to contract Pa'nar syndrome.
Good day.
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 (She is meditating with a candle when the comm.
beeps,)
T'POL: Yes.
HOSHI [OC]: There's a message for you coming from the surface.
T'POL: Transfer it here.
HOSHI [OC]: Right away.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in. (T'Pol enters.) ARCHER: I was just about
to call you. Sit down. I'm sorry. I didn't have much luck down there.
They seemed pretty pig-headed when it comes to Pa'nar syndrome, and I
got the distinct feeling they're not going to keep this to themselves.
T'POL: I just received a message from Doctor Yuris.
ARCHER: Which one was he?
T'POL: The youngest. He asked me to meet him in a northern section of
the city. I believe he wants to help.
ARCHER: Help? That seems like the last thing these doctors want to do.
T'POL: He asked me to come alone.
 [Deleted scene - Shuttlepod]
ARCHER: (piloting) You know, it never dawned on me that it was
contagious.
T'POL: I beg your pardon?
ARCHER: You said it wasn't contagious, that there was nothing I could
have done.
T'POL: That's correct.
ARCHER: That doesn't mean you shouldn't have told me.
T'POL: There's a landing port about a kilometre south of the meeting
place. You worry about your crew.
ARCHER: You're damn straight I do. Every last one of them. You find
that strange? I guess all Vulcans find worrying strange.
T'POL: I didn't want you to worry about me. 
 [City - evening]
(Yuris is hiding behind a column.)  YURIS: Sub-Commander.
This may be of use to you. (He offers a container.)
T'POL: What is it?
YURIS: The research your doctor asked for.
(She opens the container to reveal six vials.)
T'POL: You've taken a great risk by bringing this to me.
YURIS: One that I'm more than willing to take.
T'POL: Why?
YURIS: There's more intolerance today than there was a thousand years
ago. It has to stop.
T'POL: Why jeopardise your career to help someone you despise?
YURIS: If I despised you, I'd be despising myself. I'm part of the
minority.
(They sit on a bench.)
T'POL: You know I'm not a member of the minority.
YURIS: As far as my colleagues are concerned, you might as well be.
Anyone who chooses to perform a mind-meld is worthy of contempt.
T'POL: What if I didn't choose?
YURIS: You were coerced. You should tell them. They'll be far more
sympathetic.
T'POL: Are you infected?
YURIS: No. Only a small percentage are. If they ask my opinion, I won't
be able to condone what you did. I hope you understand.
T'POL: You can't jeopardise your position.
YURIS: I have to return. Tell them what happened. Tell them before they
contact the High Command.
T'POL: Thank you for this.
 [Mess hall]
 HOSHI: It doesn't make any sense.
TUCKER: Why not?
HOSHI: We're orbiting an alien world, and most of the crew are free to
go down and visit. Why would anyone want to stay on board and watch a
movie?
TUCKER: Are you kidding? They're showing The Black Cat. Boris Karloff
and Bela Lugosi.
HOSHI: It sounds like you're the one picking the movies.
TUCKER: Me?
HOSHI: Who else would choose an obscure horror film? Why not something
a little more, I don't know, romantic? I'm going down to the surface.
(Feezal enters and selects a meal.)
TUCKER: What's the rush? You haven't even finished your dinner.
HOSHI: There's a shuttle leaving at eighteen hundred hours.
TUCKER: You've got plenty of time. (He is keeping an eye on Feezal's
progress.) TUCKER: Try the cobbler. Chef outdid himself.
HOSHI: Okay, but I have to leave in a few minutes.
FEEZAL: May I join you?
HOSHI: Please. I'm Hoshi Sato. I've been meaning to introduce myself.
FEEZAL: Feezal Phlox. You're the language wizard. My husband speaks
very fondly of you.
HOSHI: (in Denobulan) Doctor Phlox has been teaching me Denobulan.
FEEZAL: (in Denobulan) I'm impressed.
HOSHI: (in Denobulan) I'm still having trouble with the transitive
verbs.
TUCKER: I'm getting a little paranoid here. You're not talking about
me, are you?
HOSHI: Matter of fact, we were.(Feezal rubs her foot against Tucker's leg.)
FEEZAL: Ensign Sato barely has an
accent. She was telling me how attractive she thinks you are.
HOSHI: She's pulling your leg, sir. I was only talking about grammar.
TUCKER: It's okay, Hoshi.
HOSHI: I've got to go. It was very nice to meet you. (Hoshi leaves.)
FEEZAL: I wasn't exactly pulling your leg, was I?
TUCKER: No, not exactly. Look, I'm very flattered, but aren't you a
married woman?
FEEZAL: I'm a woman. That's all that matters, isn't it?
TUCKER: I'm afraid I've got to go, too. Captain asked me to write a
synopsis of tonight's movie.
FEEZAL: Save me a seat.
TUCKER: You probably wouldn't like it. It's very scary, and you've got
to. You've got to be human to appreciate horror films. I'll see you in
the morning.
(Tucker leaves rapidly, and Feezal admires the sight of his departing figure.)
 [Gymnasium]
 (Reed is on a static bicycle.)
TUCKER: She's at it again.
REED: I don't know about you, but I find her quite attractive. (Tucker gets on the other bicycle.)
TUCKER: Come on, Malcolm, this is serious.
What if Phlox finds out?
REED: You haven't done anything to make her think that you
TUCKER: Of course not. Maybe I should tell the Doc.
REED: Tell him what? That his wife is trying to seduce you? Not a good
idea.
TUCKER: I've got to spend the next two days with her working on the
microscope. I really think I should speak to Phlox.
REED: It might be a lot easier to avoid her advances than to get Phlox
angry. I once saw him lose his temper when one of his creatures bit
him. It wasn't a pretty sight.
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox looks at a monitor.) PHLOX: This is far from a
cure, but it should slow down the progression of the disease. It's
surprising. I assumed your Science Directorate would've made more
progress than this.
T'POL: As we've seen, they're not very motivated to develop a cure.
PHLOX: With this research, I should be able to get closer than they
have.
ARCHER: (entering) How useful is it?
PHLOX: Very. It will allow me to improve my course of treatment long
before her symptoms get worse.
ARCHER: Have you figured out why Doctor Yuris gave it to you?
T'POL: No, I haven't. You spoke with them.
ARCHER: A few minutes ago. They've decided to recall you.
PHLOX: Do they have the authority to do that?
ARCHER: Doctor Oratt does. He's a ranking member of the Council of
Physicians. They plan on taking you back to Vulcan when the conference
is over.
T'POL: Have they notified the High Command?
ARCHER: Not till you reach Vulcan. You've got to tell them, T'Pol. Tell
them what happened. They won't do a thing to you once they know it
wasn't voluntary, that he did it against your will.
T'POL: I won't do that.
ARCHER: Why the hell not?
T'POL: I have Pa'nar Syndrome. It doesn't make a difference how I
contracted it.
ARCHER: It makes a lot of difference. You're not a member of this
minority. He forced himself on you. You said it yourself.
PHLOX: He's right, T'Pol. You should tell them.
T'POL: He is not right. If I use that as a defence as a way to keep
from being taken off Enterprise, I'd be condoning their prejudice, and
in the process, indicting every member of the minority. I won't do
that.
 [Vulcan medical area]
 ARCHER: (bursting in) Where's Oratt?
VULCAN: Doctor Oratt isn't available. Perhaps I can help you?
ARCHER: Perhaps you can't. (He knocks on the glass partition between him
and the trio.)
VULCAN: You're going to have to leave.
ARCHER: (pointing at Oratt) I need to talk to you!
VULCAN: I told him you were busy.
ORATT: What can I do for you, Captain? (Oratt glares at the Vulcan, who leaves
them.)
ARCHER: You have no right to take my Science Officer.
ORATT: You're mistaken. I have every right.
ARCHER: You can't dismiss someone just because you don't agree with the
way they conduct their personal lives.
ORATT: I am not dismissing T'Pol. I'm simply returning her to Vulcan.
The High Command will decide whether she is fit for duty.
ARCHER: Fit? You're saying a single mind-meld is enough to destroy her
career? Or is it that she contracted the disease? That's why you're so
hesitant to find a cure, isn't it? Why bother to help people you don't
approve of?
ORATT: I'm sorry you don't understand the complexities of our culture,
Captain. Please have the Sub-Commander ready to depart in thirty six
hours.
ARCHER: Not so fast. You know what this is, Doctor? My Communications
Officer got it from the Vulcan database. It's the protocols of the
Council of Physicians. It says that anyone accused of ethical
misconduct is entitled to a hearing before the ranking medical officer
in the province or territory where the accusation was first made. If
I'm not mistaken, that would be you.
ORATT: The accusation against T'Pol stands. It's not open for debate.
ARCHER: Where I come from, everything's open for debate. And if I read
these protocols correctly, so is the accusation you made against my
Science Officer.
ORATT: You're wasting your time.
ARCHER: It's mine to waste.
ORATT: Very well. But I will not delay our departure. The hearing will
take place tomorrow afternoon.
ARCHER: Tomorrow afternoon. Fine.
 [Sickbay]
(Travis displays a magnificent bruise on his
ribs.)  TRAVIS: It's the Dekendi's favourite sport.
PHLOX: Just because they asked you to participate, doesn't mean you had
to.
TRAVIS: They said it was an honour. It looked easy enough.
PHLOX: You're lucky this creature didn't strike a bit lower. If I may
ask, what is the purpose of this sport?
TRAVIS: They've got these fargans. They're kind of like cows with
humps, and they love melons. I think they're melons. So, four guys get
into this big circle filled with fargans and they throw these melons
back and forth. They use sticks with metal baskets at the end. Do you
play monkey-in-the-middle on Denobula?
PHLOX: I don't believe so.
TRAVIS: Anyway, after a while, the fargans start figuring out what's
going on, and
TUCKER: (interrupting) You got a minute, Doc?
PHLOX: Are you not feeling well, Commander?
TUCKER: No, I'm fine. I just, er, I need to talk to you for a minute.
PHLOX: By all means. What's on your mind?
TUCKER: Actually, I was kind of hoping to talk to you alone.
PHLOX: I think we're about done here. It would be best if you avoided
fargans for a few days.
TRAVIS: Thanks, Doc. Commander. (Travis leaves.)
TUCKER: See you, Travis. Malcolm said this was a bad idea, but I, I
think it's the right thing to do.
PHLOX: What's that?
TUCKER: Feezal, I mean, Mrs. Phlox, is a lovely woman, and she's very
smart. She knows more about quantum optics than anyone I've ever met.
PHLOX: She is remarkable.
TUCKER: Remarkable, yeah, she sure is.
PHLOX: Was there something else?
TUCKER: Yeah, there is. You got to understand, I've been a perfect
gentleman. Absolutely nothing's happened. She's trying to. She's,
she's, er, making advances, if you know what I mean?
PHLOX: Sexual advances?
TUCKER: I'm afraid so.
PHLOX: (grinning) Has she offered to give you a rose petal bath?
TUCKER: No, no, no. Nothing like that.
PHLOX: Oh, any man would be a fool to ignore the romantic overtures of
a healthy Denobulan woman. Don't you find her attractive?
TUCKER: Sure. I mean, no, she's your wife.
PHLOX: What does that have to do with it?
TUCKER: She's your wife?
PHLOX: Oh, nonsense. Nonsense. You're too concerned with human
morality. I thought you wanted to learn about new cultures. Isn't that
why you joined Starfleet?
TUCKER: Why, of course it is. But I was brought up believing you don't
play around with another man's wife. I don't think I'm ever going to
change my mind about that.
PHLOX: As you wish. Your loss.
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 (T'Pol is packing her ornaments when the door
chimes.)
T'POL: Come in. (Archer comes in and sits down.) T'POL: Lieutenant Reed told me
you went to the surface.
ARCHER: I spoke to Doctor Oratt. I didn't tell you because I didn't
want you to try and talk me out of it.
T'POL: I assume you were unsuccessful.
ARCHER: Not exactly. Before I left, I got the medical protocols from
Hoshi. It seems they owe you a hearing.
T'POL: They'll never agree.
ARCHER: They already did.
T'POL: I have no interest in challenging their decision.
ARCHER: If you're not going to defend yourself, the least you can do is
speak for this minority you're so eager to protect. You said you didn't
want to condone the attitude of these doctors. Your silence would do
just that.
T'POL: You need to understand. I won't tell them how I got the disease.
ARCHER: I'll go along with that. I promise. But you've got to
understand, I'm not going to give you up without a fight.
 [Vulcan medical area]
 (Yuris, Oratt and Stromm are sitting at a long
table, with Archer and T'Pol on chairs opposite.)
STROMM: The fact that she has Pa'nar Syndrome is not the reason she's
being recalled.
ARCHER: No. It has to do with how she got infected. A mind meld over a
year ago.
STROMM: When it took place is not pertinent.
ARCHER: So what you're saying is that if a Vulcan, even an officer in
the Science Directorate, engages in this exchange of thoughts and
memories, they're condemned for it?
ORATT: As you've been told, Captain, mind melds are practiced by a
subculture. Vulcans who have elected to conduct themselves in an
unacceptable manner.
T'POL: They haven't elected to do anything. They're born with this
ability.
STROMM: Exactly. They're genetic aberrations who prey on people like
you. People foolish enough to experiment with abhorrent behaviour.
ARCHER: You humans are too volatile, too irrational, too narrow-minded.
That's what I heard for years, from every Vulcan I met. But we don't
hold a candle to you when it comes to narrow-minded. We got rid of
bigotry nearly a century ago. We're not afraid of diversity. We don't
persecute it, we embrace it. If you call yourselves enlightened, you
have to accept people who are different than you are.
STROMM: This is pointless. Our culture is governed by rules. We're not
about to ignore them.
T'POL: There are no rules telling you to oppress minorities.
STROMM: You'd rather let them spread their infections. That's exactly
why you're being recalled.
T'POL: No, I'm being recalled because you're afraid of anything that
doesn't conform to your idea of acceptable behaviour.
STROMM: Unfortunately, you don't know what you're talking about. The
decision's been made. We should end this inquiry.
YURIS: She knows exactly what she's talking about.
ORATT: Are you questioning our judgement?
YURIS: There is nothing abhorrent about the way we lead our lives.
STROMM: We?
YURIS: There is no simple definition of intimacy. Those of us capable
of mind-melds are no different than you are.
ORATT: You realise that you are jeopardising your reputation, your
career?
YURIS: We share our thoughts differently. We shouldn't be punished for
that.
ORATT: The High Command will determine whether you should be punished.
Both of you. (stands to leave)
YURIS: She's not guilty of anything. She was violated.
T'POL: You gave me your word.
YURIS: The mind-meld was performed against her will.
ORATT: Can you verify this?
T'POL: Why? So you can perpetuate your double standard? Condemn the
infected when they meld by choice and sympathise with them when they
don't?
ORATT: What do you know of this, Captain?
ARCHER: Seems my Science Officer doesn't want to discuss it. That's
good enough for me.
YURIS: She told me herself. She made me promise to stay silent. I'm
sorry. I had to tell them the truth. You should do the same.
T'POL: I have nothing to say to them.
 [Sickbay]
 (In front of the new neutron microscope.)
PHLOX: Feezal tells me it can be quite temperamental.
TUCKER: I think I've got it figured out. Just let me know when it
starts acting up. Have you got the activation sequence down?
PHLOX: (as Feezal enters) My beloved. I certainly hope it's not another
four years until I see you again.
FEEZAL: So do I. But remember, your other wives are anxious to see you
too.
PHLOX: Commander Tucker assures me he'll keep your beautiful microscope
in perfect running order.
FEEZAL: As his doctor, I hope you'll keep Commander Tucker in perfect
running order. Perhaps that'll motivate me to visit more often.
PHLOX: It's a shame you two didn't get to know each other better.
TUCKER: Well, I've got to get back to my warp engine. The plasma's
running a little hot.
FEEZAL: I know how it feels.
TUCKER: Pleasure meeting you. (Tucker leaves.)
PHLOX: Humans. (They both laugh.)
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in. (T'Pol enters.) ARCHER: Doctor Yuris has
been suspended.
T'POL: That was to be expected.
ARCHER: They offered him a hearing, but he refused. Oratt said he'll
lose his standing with the Medical Exchange when they get back to
Vulcan.
T'POL: Also to be expected.
ARCHER: One good thing did come out of this. They believed him when he
said you were forced. You're not going to be recalled.
T'POL: With your permission, I'll be contacting the High Command. I
don't intend to let Yuris be dismissed without a fight.
ARCHER: Permission granted. I know you must be very disappointed that
he broke his promise to you, but on a selfish note, I'm glad he did. I
didn't want to lose you.
T'POL: Maybe this incident will encourage others to speak out.
ARCHER: Let's hope so.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Cease Fire
Cease
Fire
 Original Airdate: 12 Feb, 2003
  [Shran's
command post]
 (Flashes of weapons fire break the dark of night.
A wounded Andorian is carried into the room.)
SHRAN: Report.
TARAH: (the wonderful Suzie Plaxson) The Imperial Guard
will die at their posts, but
SHRAN: I know my men are willing to die. I want to hear their chances
of surviving.
TARAH: We're holding our positions for now, but the enemy has deployed
new units here and here.
SHRAN: They're looking for a weakness.
TARAH: They may have found it. We've taken more casualties.
SHRAN: I've received a communiqué. The Vulcans want to discuss terms
for a cease fire.
TARAH: Have you ever known a Vulcan who wouldn't lie to get what he
wanted?
SHRAN: There is another option. Someone I've dealt with. A pinkskin.
He's proven to be quite even-handed in dealing with Vulcans. His name
is Archer.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: You're sure he wants me?
FORREST [on monitor]: Ambassador Soval said your presence is crucial to
resolving the crisis.
ARCHER: What's this planet called again?
FORREST [on monitor]: The Vulcan name is Paan Mokar. The Andorians call
it Weytahn. It's on the frontier between their systems. Both sides
claim it belongs to them. They've nearly gone to war over it twice in
the past century.
ARCHER: How do they expect me to help settle a conflict they haven't
been able to resolve in a hundred years?
FORREST [on monitor]: Soval says you'll be fully briefed when you
arrive. Jonathan, this is the first time the Vulcans have asked for our
help. You're the closest thing we have to an ambassador out there. You
know how important this could be.
ARCHER: We'll get there as fast as we can.
 [Captain's mess]
(Tucker watches his glass vibrating on the
table.)
 TUCKER: I don't like pushing the engines this
hard. The injectors are
running at a hundred and ten percent.
T'POL: They're rated for one hundred and twenty.
TUCKER: And my underwear is flame-retardant. That doesn't mean I'm
going to light myself on fire to prove it.
ARCHER: I think we'll make it in one piece, Trip. I've been reading
about Paan Mokar in the Vulcan database. It doesn't say a lot. Class D,
not much bigger than Earth's moon, claimed by the Vulcans in 2097.
TUCKER: Class D? That's uninhabitable. Why are you fighting over it?
T'POL: When the Andorians first arrived a century ago, they began to
terraform the planet. Once an atmosphere was developed, they
established a settlement.
ARCHER: If it was unclaimed at the time, why would there be a problem?
T'POL: Its sole value is its strategic location near Vulcan space.
ARCHER: They were setting up a military base?
T'POL: It was the only logical conclusion.
TUCKER: Was there any evidence?
T'POL: How much evidence would you need if the Klingons decided to set
up a colony on Pluto?
TUCKER: That's not the same thing.
T'POL: The Andorians refused to let the High Command inspect the
colony. So, they annexed Paan Mokar to protect their territory.
ARCHER: What happened to the Andorian colonists?
T'POL: They were removed.
TUCKER: By force.
T'POL: They left the High Command little choice. A surveillance
satellite was put into orbit to monitor the agreement. The planet's
been deserted for nearly a century.
ARCHER: Until now.
 Captain's Starlog, supplemental. In the three days
it's taken us to reach Paan Mokar, the situation has grown considerably
more tense.
 [Conference room]
 (Two Vulcan ships are astern of Enterprise in
orbit.)
TUCKER: Unbelievable. I damn near burn up the warp reactor getting
here, and they make us wait.
(Soval and Muroc enter, with T'Pol.)
ARCHER: Welcome aboard, Ambassador.
SOVAL: Thank you, Captain. This is Sub-commander Muroc.
ARCHER: T'Pol has been filling me in on the situation here, but I still
have a lot of questions.
SOVAL: (sitting) If you don't mind, Captain, I have a question of my
own. Why would an officer of the Andorian Imperial Guard personally
request your involvement?
ARCHER: I don't understand. I was told you asked for me.
SOVAL: I'm involved in extremely difficult and dangerous negotiations.
I don't consider your presence here an asset.
ARCHER: If that's how you feel, we'll gladly continue with our mission.
SOVAL: Six days ago, an Andorian regimental commander named Shran
landed a force on Paan Mokar and occupied the settlement.
ARCHER: Shran.
SOVAL: Naturally, we attempted to enforce the Treaty of 2097.
TUCKER: Naturally.
MUROC: We've regained control of half the colony, but two dozen Vulcans
have been wounded and three have been taken hostage.
SOVAL: Shran has agreed to discuss terms for their safe return, but
only if you act as mediator. For some reason, he finds you trustworthy.
ARCHER: You're asking for my help?
SOVAL: Yes, Captain, I'm asking for your help.
ARCHER: I'll see what I can do.
SOVAL: Forgive my candor, but that's hardly reassuring. The last time
you dealt with the Andorians, a Vulcan intelligence site was
compromised and a priceless monastery destroyed. Sub-commander Muroc
will accompany you to represent our interests.
ARCHER: Obviously, I'm here at the request of the Andorians. Shran
believes he can trust me. I don't intend to prove him wrong by going
down there with a Vulcan officer in tow. If you insist I bring a Vulcan
along, I'll take the one I know I can trust.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: You wanted to see me, Doc?
PHLOX: Yes. This planet is home to a rather pernicious mutagenic
pathogen, and I'll need to bombard your immune system with analeptic
radiation to protect you while you're on the surface.
ARCHER: Bombard.
PHLOX: It's quite painless, I assure you.
ARCHER: What about T'Pol?
PHLOX: Vulcan physiology isn't affected by the pathogen. Shall we?
(Archer enters the Decon Chamber and Phlox stands at the window. A
purple light comes on.)
PHLOX: This should only take a moment. If I may ask, how did your first
meeting with the Vulcans go?
ARCHER: Warm and friendly as ever.
PHLOX: Ironic. They weren't overly enthusiastic about you taking
command of Enterprise in the first place, and now your presence is
crucial to their interests.
ARCHER: It's crucial to ours, too. Maybe we're not out here to just
scan comets and meet new species. Maybe we're out here to prove that
humanity is ready to join a much larger community. I intend to do that,
whether the Vulcans like it or not.
PHLOX: All finished.
(The purple light goes off.)
PHLOX: Captain, I served as a
medic in the Denobulan infantry. If I learned anything from that
experience, it's that battlefields are unpredictable places, even under
a flag of truce. Be careful.
 [Shuttlepod]
 (Shortly after launching from Enterprise. Archer
is piloting.)
ARCHER: We've lost the navigational sensors, and the comm.
T'POL: It's the Andorian jamming signal. I'm entering the landing
coordinates they gave us.
ARCHER: Let's hope they're accurate.
T'POL: Did you have a chance to read the Territorial Compromise?
ARCHER: I glanced at it.
T'POL: The Compromise is at the heart of this dispute. It's worth your
attention.
ARCHER: It's twelve hundred pages long.
T'POL: Did you glance at any of the other materials I sent to your
quarters? V'Lar's treatise on negotiating tactics is the definitive
text on the subject.
ARCHER: I got all of it. V'Lar's treatise, the Revised Intersystem
Agreement, the High Command briefing on the Border Incursions of 2112.
I was up till two a.m.
T'POL: Glancing.
ARCHER: Are you trying to tell me something? That maybe I'm not
prepared for this?
T'POL: Ambassador Soval clearly believes you'll fail. I was hoping some
advance preparation would help you prove him wrong.
ARCHER: Thanks, but I doubt I'm going to impress Shran by quoting
Vulcan treaties.
T'POL: I assume you have a strategy?
ARCHER: The first thing is to convince Shran that he can trust me.
T'POL: And then?
ARCHER: We're just going to have to play it by ear.
 [Colony]
 (It's still night, there's still weapons fire
around, the place looks a mess.)
ARCHER: Are you sure these are the coordinates?
T'POL: Yes.
(They move through the buildings.)
TARAH: Don't move, Vulcan.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: We're not armed.
(More weapons are aimed at them from all
angles.)
ARCHER: I'm Captain Jonathan Archer. I'm here to see Commander Shran.
TARAH: He's expecting you, without a Vulcan escort.
ARCHER: I wasn't told to come alone. This is my Science Officer. She
helped expose the Vulcan listening post at P'Jem. I thought Shran might
enjoy seeing her again.
(Bags are placed over their head and they are lead away.)
 [Shran's command post]
 (The bags are removed as they sit down.)
ARCHER: I imagined my first diplomatic mission would involve sitting
around a big table, toasting with champagne, signing things with lots
of pens.
SHRAN: The pinkskin sense of humour. My apologies for the security
precautions.
TARAH: We can never be too vigilant when it comes to Vulcans.
ARCHER: They say the same thing about you.
SHRAN: I'm sure they do. We're aggressive, illogical.
ARCHER: Prove them wrong.
SHRAN: That's why you're here, Captain. To help us do just that. I've
dealt with the Vulcans twice before, where you were involved. Both
times you handled the situation without prejudice.
ARCHER: I hope I can help again, but the first thing I need is to see
the hostages.
TARAH: Hostages? Criminals take hostages. Kidnappers looking for a
ransom take hostages. I assume you're referring to the enemy soldiers
we captured.
ARCHER: The Vulcans want to know they're all right.
SHRAN: They haven't been harmed.
(He takes them to look into a room where three Vulcans are tied up.)
ARCHER: Are you all right?
TARAH: When they attacked us, two of my men were badly wounded. (She shuts
the door again.) TARAH: They're lucky we didn't kill them.
T'POL: You provoked this situation when you violated the Territorial
Compromise. TARAH: Only a Vulcan could call a hundred years of
oppression a compromise. You annexed a planet that belongs to us,
herded our people into refugee camps.
T'POL: After you set up a military outpost here.
SHRAN: As you can see, Captain, even after a hundred years, this
situation still evokes anger on both sides. We will release our
prisoners on the following conditions. Immediate withdrawal of all
Vulcan military forces, the so-called compromise is to be rescinded,
and the Vulcans must concede irrevocable sovereignty of Weytahn to
Andoria.
ARCHER: You don't expect them to agree to all that.
TARAH: I told you. He's a puppet of the Vulcans.
ARCHER: For the record, the Vulcan High Command doesn't like me very
much, and, frankly, the feeling is mutual. If all you need is someone
to deliver your list of demands, find somebody else. I've got other
things to do.
SHRAN: The Vulcans always say they're ready to talk, but it amounts to
nothing. Treaty negotiations that drag on for years. I want to speak to
Soval. Somebody who can deal with the situation without having to check
with his superiors.
ARCHER: I'll see what I can do.
SHRAN: Here. On my terms.
ARCHER: That might be a little difficult.
TARAH: This is pointless.
ARCHER: But not impossible. The thing is, he's going to want something
in return.
SHRAN: Haven't they already taken enough?
ARCHER: I'm talking about a gesture, something to show you're serious.
I came down here to see about the hostages. Why don't you let them go?
TARAH: And give away our only advantage?
SHRAN: No.
ARCHER: Release two of them, then. Keep the other one until after
you've met with Soval.
SHRAN: One, as a show of our good faith.
 [Deleted scene - Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER: (piloting) You're being awfully
quiet.
T'POL: Is there something you'd like to discuss?
ARCHER: You don't seem too happy with the way I handled things down
there.
T'POL: As Shran said, this is a provocative issue. However, I think you
did well.
ARCHER: Thank you.
T'POL: But my opinion often differs from the High Command's.
 [Conference room]
 SOVAL: Unacceptable.
ARCHER: You got one of your men back.
SOVAL: And in exchange, you'll deliver me into their hands? I'm sure
the Andorians were impressed with your negotiating skills.
ARCHER: They want to talk to you, not kidnap you.
SOVAL: If I agree to a meeting, it's simply legitimises their position.
ARCHER: And if you don't, these negotiations end before they begin.
MUROC: That may happen sooner than you realise. While you were on the
surface, we detected three Andorian vessels approaching. They'll be
here in less than five hours.
SOVAL: They probably intend to re-supply their troops on the surface.
We won't allow that.
T'POL: Engaging an Andorian vessel could be construed as an act of war.
SOVAL: That will be their decision.
ARCHER: Both sides are responsible for what happens here.
SOVAL: You don't understand the complexities of this situation.
ARCHER: With all due respect, Ambassador, why did you agree to let me
go down there if you won't listen to my advice?
SOVAL: I didn't request your help, Captain, and I don't feel obliged to
accept it.
ARCHER: You claim the Andorians are inflexible. At least they're
willing to sit down and talk. The ball's in your court now.
T'POL: It's a human expression. It means the next move is yours.
 [Launch bay]
 MUROC: This isn't wise. The colony hasn't been
secured.
SOVAL: Didn't you hear the Captain? The ball is in our court.
(Soval goes down the steps with T'Pol while Muroc stalks out.)
TUCKER: I don't like this. With all the interference, you won't be able
to contact the ship if something goes wrong.
ARCHER: They're expecting us. We'll be fine.
TUCKER: Those Andorian ships'll be here in four hours.
ARCHER: I plan on being back long before then.
TUCKER: T'Pol said that Territorial Compromise they were talking about
took eight years to work out.
ARCHER: I'll try to speed things up this time.
 [Shran's command post]
 SHRAN: (to soldiers) Bring them here as soon as
they land, and treat the Vulcan with respect.
SOLDIER: Yes, sir. (They leave.)
TARAH: If I may speak.
SHRAN: You don't have to. I know what you're going to say. We
discovered this planet. We made it livable. It belongs to us. Don't
worry, it'll be ours again.
TARAH: How? By talking? We've been trying that for a hundred years, and
it's gotten us nowhere. They stall and lie and make promises they never
intend to keep. We came here to fight. Why back down now?
SHRAN: I'm willing to give Archer another chance.
TARAH: You put too much faith in these pinkskins. We don't know
anything about them except that they're friends of the Vulcans.
SHRAN: Not always. I've seen that for myself.
TARAH: If we attack now, we can have the Vulcans on the defensive
before our ships arrive.
SHRAN: Your recommendation is noted.
TARAH: Our troops are ready. There's no reason to wait.
SHRAN: Enough. I value your opinion, Tarah, but that does not allow you
to question my commands. Dismissed.
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER: (piloting) They'll send some soldiers to
meet us. I'm afraid they'll want to blindfold you. It's just a security
precaution.
SOVAL: Thank you for the reassurance. Now if you don't mind, I'll need
a few moments of silence to prepare myself.
ARCHER: Of course. (The pod jolts.) ARCHER: T'Pol?
T'POL: Weapons fire. I can't pinpoint the source.
(We see it is coming from several points in the colony.)
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise.
T'POL: We're still within their jamming range.
SOVAL: I suggest we cancel the negotiations and return to your ship.
ARCHER: For once we're in full agreement.
T'POL: Direct hit to our starboard engine. Main power is offline.
SOVAL: Now you see who you're dealing with, Captain?
ARCHER: If you don't mind, Ambassador.
T'POL: We're losing altitude. Two hundred metres.
ARCHER: I'm going to bring us in on thrusters.
T'POL: One hundred metres. Fifty. We need to reduce our speed.
ARCHER: The ground is going to do that for us. Brace yourselves.
(The pod slides to a halt along an old street.)
 [Colony]
 (The three climb out of the pod.)
ARCHER: Any idea where we are?
SOVAL: The southeast quadrant, near the old spaceport. I told you I
negotiated the last accord. I also served here.
T'POL: You were with the occupation force?
SOVAL: As an intelligence officer, a long time ago. Our current
deployment has a base of operations that way, about two and a half
kilometres.
ARCHER: I appreciate your help, Ambassador but we're looking for the
Andorians.
SOVAL: Circumstances have altered our plans.
ARCHER: I gave my word to Shran. I intend to keep it.
SOVAL: Shran just tried to kill us.
ARCHER: We don't know that.
SOVAL: I suppose you think our troops are responsible for this?
ARCHER: Sensors and communications are offline. There's weapons fire
flying all over the place. We don't know what happened.
SOVAL: Are you that naive? Shran is using you.
ARCHER: This is a man who couldn't sleep because he thought he owed me
something. I don't believe he asked me to come a dozen light years just
so I could lead you into a trap. And right now it seems like the best
thing to do is to get a cease-fire in place. The Andorians won't agree
to that until they talk to you in person. I managed to keep us on
course most of the way in. We can't be more than a kilometre from
Shran's landing coordinates.
(He starts walking, T'Pol follows and then Soval, reluctantly.)
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER: How would you know? We can't pick up
anything through the interference.
MUROC [on viewscreen]: Our scanners are more sophisticated than yours.
We detected weapons fire coming from the surface. Then your shuttle
appeared to make an emergency landing somewhere in the colony.
TUCKER: Where?
MUROC [on viewscreen]: We haven't been able to pinpoint their landing
site, but our units on the ground are already searching. The High
Command instructed me to take steps to recover Ambassador Soval.
REED: And our officers?
MUROC [on viewscreen]: Of course.
TUCKER: We want to be involved in any rescue operation.
MUROC [on viewscreen]: We have more experience in these matters.
TUCKER: I know. I once saw one of your commando units blast the hell
out of a rebel compound during a rescue mission.
MUROC [on viewscreen]: We won't allow this provocation to continue.
TUCKER: You don't even know where they are. Do you really think it's a
good idea to go down there guns blazing?
MUROC [on viewscreen]: Our response will be appropriate. I'll keep you
informed, Commander. (Ends transmission.)
TUCKER: Any luck?
HOSHI: I'm trying, sir, but if the Vulcans can't find them.
TUCKER: See what you can do.
HOSHI: Yes, sir.
TUCKER: How far away are those Andorian ships?
TRAVIS: Three hours at their present speed.
 [Shran's command post]
 SHRAN: That shuttle was to be left alone. I gave
specific orders.
TARAH: And they were followed.
SHRAN: Then who fired those shots? The Vulcans, I suppose, trying to
kill their own Ambassador?
TARAH: Is that so unlikely? Some of my men saw weapons fire coming from
their positions. It's Vulcan subterfuge, I'm sure of it. What better
way for them to justify an invasion than to blame us for killing their
envoy?
SHRAN: They are devious, but I doubt even they would go that far.
TARAH: You act as if they have some moral code. They have no
conscience, only their precious logic. They'll do anything to drive us
off this planet. We should never have agreed to negotiate.
SHRAN: You're not happy with the way I've handled this situation?
TARAH: Of course I am, sir.
SOLDIER: The Sector Two Report, sir.
SHRAN: Put our positions on alert. I want Soval and the pinkskin
brought to me alive. If they're looking for an excuse to attack, we
won't give it to them.
TARAH: I'll see to it myself.
 [Colony]
 SOVAL: Perhaps you were farther off course than
you thought.
ARCHER: You've been here before. I don't suppose you'd care to help?
SOVAL: It's been almost a hundred years.
ARCHER: I thought Vulcans had exceptional memories.
SOVAL: This is the old residential quarter. According to our latest
intelligence, the Andorians control the settlement west of here.
ARCHER: If we keep moving this way, we should be (weapons fire) Down!
SOVAL: Not quite the warm welcome you expected, Captain?
ARCHER: They're not shooting at us.
T'POL: The Vulcan units must be advancing their positions.
SOVAL: We should try to make contact with them.
ARCHER: I don't recommend sticking your neck out right now.
SOVAL: What do you recommend? Wandering through these ruins until we
find an Andorian soldier, and trust he's been informed not to shoot us
on sight?
ARCHER: I'll take a look. Stay here.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: That's an order. No offence, but my ears are less likely to
draw fire than yours. (He leaves.)
SOVAL: What is their fixation with our ears?
T'POL: I believe they're envious.
SOVAL: Do you realise you've picked up a slight human accent? You were
one of the most promising members of my staff, T'Pol. If you'd stayed
in San Francisco, you'd be the Assistant Counsel by now. You might even
have a diplomatic posting of your own.
T'POL: I am aware of that.
SOVAL: Then why have you remained on Enterprise?
T'POL: We believed they needed our help when they first developed warp
drive. That hasn't changed.
SOVAL: Captain Archer's record is evidence of that, but there are
others who can assist them.
T'POL: I find the work gratifying.
SOVAL: Gratification is an emotional indulgence. You disagreed with our
recommendation that Archer's mission be cancelled after the tragedy at
Paraaga Two. Why?
T'POL: I was onboard Enterprise at the time. I felt my opinion would be
welcomed.
SOVAL: You believed you knew better than the High Command? That sounds
a great deal like another emotion, arrogance. Perhaps it's time for you
to consider another assignment.
T'POL: Just because Captain Archer has earned my respect doesn't mean I
have been contaminated by his emotions. (Archer comes running back.) T'POL: Did
you make contact?
ARCHER: No. They're pulling back. Let's keep moving.
 [Shuttlepod]
 TARAH: Empty.
SOLDIER: They're probably trying to reach the Vulcans.
TARAH: No. The pinkskin will want to keep his part of the bargain.
They'll be looking for Shran.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: Commander.
TUCKER: You have something?
HOSHI: I can't be sure. You see this EM differential here?
TUCKER: That's the Captain?
HOSHI: It's definitely a biosign. I'm ninety percent sure it's human.
TUCKER: At least we know he's alive. Where is he?
HOSHI: I need another hour.
TUCKER: What's the status on those Andorian ships?
TRAVIS: They just dropped out of warp. They'll be here in thirteen
minutes.
REED: I think the Vulcans see them, too. They're breaking orbit.
Probably giving themselves room to manoeuvre.
TUCKER: Put the ship on Tactical Alert.
 [Colony]
 (Shots are fired at them.)
ARCHER: Get down! Go. (Soval is hit in the shoulder. Archer and T'Pol
help him away.) ARCHER: Over there. (They take cover.)
T'POL: Those are Andorian weapons.
ARCHER: Hold your fire!
(They don't.)
ARCHER: How is he?
T'POL: It isn't life-threatening but he needs medical attention.
ARCHER: We've brought the Vulcan ambassador to meet with Commander
Shran! (He ducks quickly again.) ARCHER: It looks like two of them. One on top of
that structure (He fires his phase pistol at it.) ARCHER: And the other on the
ground. (Archer fires there too.) ARCHER: If I can work my way around I might be able
to come up from behind them. (He hands his pistol to Soval.)
SOVAL: What do you expect me to do with this?
ARCHER: Make sure they don't see me.
SOVAL: I haven't fired a weapon in fifty years.
ARCHER: You don't have to hit anything, just keep them occupied. Really
occupied or I'm not going to get very far.
(Soval and T'Pol lay down fire as Archer crawls and scuttles to cover
behind the uppermost sniper, then climbs a convenient ladder.)
ARCHER: Hey. (The sniper turns and gets knocked out for it.)
 [Bridge]
 (Three ships are heading for the planet.)
TUCKER: Range.
TRAVIS: Fifty thousand kilometres. They're still heading right for the
Vulcan ships.
REED: The Vulcans are charging weapons. The Andorians as well.
TUCKER: Travis, lay in a new course. I want you to put us right between
them.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
REED: If you don't mind me asking, what do you have in mind?
 [Colony]
 (Archer is making his way underneath the position
of the second sniper to sneak up behind her. It's Talah.)
ARCHER: Drop your weapon. I've never fired one of these before. (An
Andorian gun he has confiscated.) ARCHER: I'm not sure if it's set on stun.
(Tarah turns slowly towards him.)
ARCHER: T'Pol, cease fire!
TARAH: It doesn't have a stun setting. (She drops her weapon off the
ledge.)
ARCHER: You fired on my shuttle. You're trying to kill Soval, undermine
everything that Shran is trying to do here. Why? Do you want a war with
the Vulcans?
TARAH: All we want is a chance to fight for what's ours before cowards
like Shran negotiate it away.
ARCHER: You can take that up with him. Let's go.
(Archer trips on an iron ring set in the loose rubble of the ruin, and
Tarah takes the opportunity to fight with him for the gun. He falls
through a hole but still manages to hang on and beat her. Then Shran
and two soldiers turn up)
 [Bridge]
 (Enterprise is in position between three Andorian
ships and two Vulcan ones.)
HOSHI: We're being hailed by the Vulcans and the Andorians.
TUCKER: Put 'em both on. (Vulcan on the left of the viewscreen,
Andorian on the right.) TUCKER: This is Commander Tucker.
TELEV [on viewscreen]: Captain Telev of the Imperial Guard.
MUROC [on viewscreen]: Commander, I strongly recommend you withdraw to
a safe distance.
TELEV [on viewscreen]: I agree. We wouldn't want your vessel to be
damaged by debris from the Vulcan ships.
MUROC [on viewscreen]: We will not allow the Andorians to land
additional troops on Paan Mokar.
TELEV [on viewscreen]: It's called Weytahn and our personnel there have
been attacked. We'll provide whatever support they need.
MUROC [on viewscreen]: Any vessel attempting to enter orbit will be
fired upon.
TUCKER: That includes yours, Sub-commander.
TELEV [on viewscreen]: We appreciate your support, Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: Don't. I'll open fire on any ship that makes an aggressive
move. Phase-cannons?
REED: Locked and ready.
MUROC [on viewscreen]: This is not a Starfleet matter.
TUCKER: As long as my Captain is stuck in the middle of your war zone,
it is.
MUROC [on viewscreen]: The Andorians have made it impossible for us to
recover Captain Archer. By now, he's most likely a casualty.
TUCKER: Don't count him out so fast. We've managed to isolate his
bio-signature. Now, why don't you both give him and Ambassador Soval a
chance to do their jobs before we start a war up here?
 [Colony]
 TARAH: He was ready to kill me. You saw for
yourself. Apparently, these pinkskins aren't as honourable as you
thought.
(T'Pol and Soval arrive.)
ARCHER: Are you all right? I suppose I shot the Ambassador to make my
story more convincing.
SHRAN: Why would my lieutenant, a loyal member of the Imperial Guard,
lie to me?
SOVAL: Commander, it seems you're willing to resolve this situation
through peaceful means. Do all your officers feel the same?
T'POL: Have you considered there might be Andorians who would want a
war with Vulcan?
TARAH: How long have I served with you? Followed your orders when it
could have meant my life?
ARCHER: She's not the only one who risked their life. I said I'd bring
Soval to meet you and we damn near got killed getting him here. I came
because you asked me. Because you thought I could be trusted. Check
Soval's wound. Check our shuttle. You'll find Andorian weapons
signatures.
SHRAN: Is this true? Answer me!
TARAH: What did you expect me to do?
SHRAN: Follow my orders!
TARAH: Orders to do nothing while you betray us? It's not too late to
redeem yourself, to make a stand.
SHRAN: I intend to. Take her.
TARAH: There are others who feel this way. You'll see.
SHRAN: See to the Ambassador's wounds. We have a lot to discuss.
 [Bridge]
 REED: The Vulcan ships are breaking formation.
They're heading for the planet.
TRAVIS: The Andorians are following, sir.
TUCKER: Arm the forward phase-cannons. See if you can target their
weapons.
HOSHI: We're being hailed from the surface. It's the Captain.
TUCKER: Hold off, Malcolm. Put him through. Captain.
ARCHER [OC]: Nice to hear your voice, Trip.
TUCKER: What's going on down there? Are you okay?
ARCHER [OC]: T'Pol and I are fine. We're at the Andorian command post.
Ambassador Soval's been injured, but Shran's medics are treating him.
TUCKER: Did you say Shran's medics?
ARCHER [OC]: He's just being a good host. The Andorians are allowing
the Vulcan ships to move in and pick up their people.
TUCKER: Glad you let us know.
ARCHER [OC]: Did you run into any problems up there?
TUCKER: Nothing we couldn't handle. I'll fill you in later.
ARCHER [OC]: We had a pretty rough landing. We'll need a ride back to
the ship.
TUCKER: I'll send Travis down in Shuttlepod Two.
ARCHER [OC]: Acknowledged. Archer out.
TUCKER: Put us back into orbit, Travis, and cancel the tactical alert.
 Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Ambassador Soval
has begun talks with the Andorians. They've been difficult, but
productive.
 [Conference room]
 SHRAN: The Imperial Council will not be satisfied
until Vulcan recognises our claim to Weytahn.
ARCHER: I believe someone once defined a compromise as a solution that
neither side is happy with.
SHRAN: In that case, these talks have been extremely successful.
SOVAL: I consider any negotiation that averts war to be a success. (Shran stands and uncorks a purple bottle.)
SHRAN: Join me in a drink to
celebrate our mutual dissatisfaction.
SOVAL: Vulcans don't drink. But this occasion merits an exception.
(All stand and toast.)
SHRAN: To the cease fire. It wouldn't have been possible without the
help of our human friends.
SOVAL: And to the successful continuation of these talks on Andoria.
SHRAN: I trust there'll be more accomplished than just talk.
T'POL: With your permission, I'll escort Ambassador Soval to the
airlock.
ARCHER: Of course.
SOVAL: Captain, your presence here has not been overly meddlesome.
(Soval leaves.)
SHRAN: I think he likes you, pinkskin.
ARCHER: I wouldn't go that far.

Tense
 Original Airdate: 19 Feb, 2003
  [Bridge]
 (On the viewscreen is a battered looking object,
drifting in space.)
ARCHER: Biosigns?
T'POL: None that I can detect, but its hull seems to be scattering our
sensors.
ARCHER: Any idea what happened?
REED: I'm not reading any weapons signatures. Possibly some sort of
accident.
ARCHER: Bring it into Launch bay two.
 [Launch bay two]
 REED: There's no windows. I'm not sure whether
this end's the bow or the stern.
T'POL: Captain. This might be a hatch.
REED: If it is, it's been fused shut. With your permission, sir?
(He gets a phase pistol and starts cutting into the thing. When he's
done, Archer forced the hatch open and starts coughing. T'Pol checks
that the air inside is safe. Archer climbs inside and finds a seat at
the far end. He turns it around to discover a desiccated occupant.)
T'POL: He's human.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: This was a human male. A microcellular scan
should tell us his age at the time of death. Apparently, you're not the
first humans out this far.
ARCHER: Whoever this is, he's rewritten our history books. Can you get
a DNA sample?
PHLOX: The tissue damage is extensive, but I should be able to isolate
a few fragments.
ARCHER: If he's a member of Starfleet, his genetic profile is probably
in our database. Run a comparison as soon as you can.
PHLOX: Absolutely.
(T'Pol enters.)
T'POL: There aren't any ships or inhabited systems for several light
years.
ARCHER: I wonder if this could be Zephram Cochrane. They say he was
piloting a one-man vessel when he disappeared.
T'POL: How could he have travelled this far?
ARCHER: There were a lot of rumours after he was lost. One of them said
he was testing some kind of experimental warp ship. Any markings on the
hull or control panels?
T'POL: We haven't found any.
 [Launch bay two]
 REED: The hull seems to absorb EM radiation.
Without all this damage, it never would have shown up on our sensors.
TUCKER: Some kind of stealth ship. So what do you think, Travis? Could
this pilot have been a cargo hauler?
TRAVIS: We're more than thirty light years from the nearest trade
route. I don't see how he could have made it out this far.
REED: Maybe he got a ride from someone.
TUCKER: That's got to be a world record for hitchhiking. I still can't
find any plasma exhaust ports. Not even a thruster quad.
TRAVIS: There's nothing here that looks like a power source.
TUCKER: How did this thing make it into deep space without an engine?
REED: Could be an escape pod.
TUCKER: Even an escape pod would need some kind of propulsion system.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Any new mission you haven't told us about?
FORREST [on monitor]: I wish there was. It's possible the ship you
found was launched from Vega Colony, but they're a long way behind you.
The Earth Cargo Authority may have more information.
ARCHER: Phlox has sent a request to Doctor Cochrane's family. They're
transmitting his genetic profile.
FORREST [on monitor]: A hundred light years from Earth. You might have
solved the greatest missing person case of the century.
ARCHER: If we haven't, we've discovered an even bigger mystery.
 [Launch bay two]
 (Inside the mysterious object, Trip and Malcolm
are removing a floor plate.)
REED: Commander.
(They've uncovered a round thing with thick wires leading off it in 4
directions.)
REED: Registers as some kind of bio-matter.
TUCKER: Organic circuitry?
REED: Maybe we should get Phlox to come down and take a look.
TUCKER: Not a bad idea.
(They remove it and find a hatch underneath it.)
TUCKER: What's this?
(They unlock and remove it and shine their torches in.)
TUCKER: Malcolm?
REED: I see it.
(it is a ladder heading off down into somewhere that shouldn't be
there, given that the pod is no taller than a person.)
TUCKER: Good. Means I'm not hallucinating. How can a ship be bigger on
the inside than the outside?
REED: It could be a hologram.
TUCKER: Hand me that hyperspanner.
(He drops it down the hole - it hits bottom after two seconds.)
REED: You're not going down there?
TUCKER: Got to get my spanner back.
REED: We should call the Bridge first. Let them know
TUCKER: Say again, Malcolm?
(Tucker climbs down, and Reed follows. At the bottom they go into a
chamber taller than they are and bigger than the pod sitting in the
launch bay. Let's start calling it a Tardis, shall we?)
REED: This gives space exploration a whole new meaning.
TUCKER: I've read a few papers on spatial geometry. I never heard a
theory that would explain this. The Captain'll never believe us. He's
going to have to see this for himself.
(He looks at an object in the room.)
TUCKER: What do you think, a warp reactor?
REED: You're the engineer.
TUCKER: (looking at damage) Looks like a breach, overload of some kind.
REED: I'm picking up an energy signature. It's very faint.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Sir, a vessel's dropped out of warp.
They're on an intercept course.
T'POL: It's Suliban.
ARCHER: Let's see it. (the little ship appears on the viewscreen)
T'POL: Minimal weapons. I don't believe it's a combat ship.
HOSHI: We're being hailed.
SULIBAN [on viewscreen]: You have something that belongs to us.
ARCHER: I don't believe I've had the pleasure
SULIBAN [on viewscreen]: We have a salvage claim on the vessel in your
launch bay. One of our cell ships discovered it three days ago. We were
sent to retrieve it.
ARCHER: That ship's an Earth vessel. The pilot's human.
SULIBAN [on viewscreen]: I'm not interested in the corpse. Decompress
your launch bay and release the vessel.
ARCHER: (looks at T'Pol, who leaves her station and crosses over to
Reed's) I'm curious. What's your interest in that ship? There's not
much left.
SULIBAN [on viewscreen]: The vessel. Now.
T'POL: They're charging weapons.
ARCHER: You might want to contact your superiors. Ask for a man named
Silik. He'll tell you I don't respond well to threats.
 [Inside the 'Tardis']
 (Reed and Tucker remove the cover where the energy
signature is coming from.)
TUCKER: This could be a release pin. (removes the component) Let's get
it to Engineering.
 [Bridge]
 (The Suliban start firing on Enterprise, giving
everyone a good shake.)
T'POL: Forward plating is holding.
ARCHER: Bring us about, Travis. Power the phase-cannons. See what you
can do about their weapons.
 [Launch bay two]
 TUCKER: Tucker to the Bridge. The comm.'s down.
(A Suliban crawling across the ceiling jumps on him and knocks him out.
Reed dashes for a weapon, but there are others, and he only gets one.)
REED: Commander!
(A Suliban gets into the bay control room.)
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: Someone's trying to open Launch bay two.
ARCHER: Lock them out.
HOSHI: I can't.
ARCHER: Archer to Trip. (no reply) Send a security team down there.
Return fire.
(One phase cannon shot is fired.)
T'POL: Their weapons have been disabled.
ARCHER: Target their engines, and bring the grappler on line.
T'POL: Sir?
ARCHER: They wanted that ship pretty badly. I'd like to know why.
TRAVIS: They're moving off.
ARCHER: Stay with them.
(Down in the launch bay, the Suliban are beamed away, then the ship
cloaks.)
TRAVIS: I've lost them, sir.
 Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've contacted
the Vulcan ship Tal'Kir. They've agreed to meet us in three days to
take the craft back to Earth. Hopefully, we won't have another visit
from the Suliban before we reach the rendezvous point.
 [Engineering]
 (The device from the Tardis is open, and looks
like it has control crystals in it.)
TUCKER: It was heavily shielded. Whatever this thing is, it must be
pretty important.
ARCHER: What's your guess?
TUCKER: Might be the black box.
T'POL: It could it tell us what happened, maybe even who built the
vessel.
TUCKER: That's assuming we can get it working. It seems to use the same
organic circuitry as the rest of the ship. Captain, I got to take you
down into that chamber. You're not going to believe your eyes.
ARCHER: Bigger on the inside?
PHLOX [OC]: Sickbay to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Archer.
PHLOX [OC]: I need to see you immediately.
(Archer and T'Pol leave Reed and Tucker to it.)
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: I managed to find only a few undamaged
cells, but they were enough to complete a genetic analysis.
ARCHER: Is there a match in the Starfleet Database?
PHLOX: No, but I did discover that our guest is no ordinary human. I
found an unusual deviation in this nucleotide sequence. At first I
thought I was looking at some kind of mutation, but there was something
familiar about the chromosome structure, so I widened my search to
include the interspecies database. This nucleotide sequence is Vulcan.
ARCHER: How did a human end up with Vulcan DNA?
PHLOX: The likeliest explanation is that he had at least one Vulcan
ancestor further back than a great-grandparent.
ARCHER: That's not possible. We haven't known the Vulcans long enough.
PHLOX: I also found genetic material belonging to several other
species. This sequence is Terrelian. There's another I can't identify.
I believe this individual is the result of several generations of
interspecies breeding.
ARCHER: Thank you, Doctor. T'Pol.
 {Daniel's quarters]
 T'POL: A database from the future?
ARCHER: Our time-travelling friend Daniels left it in his quarters.
(He undoes the lock and goes in.)
T'POL: I'm not certain Daniels would approve of this.
ARCHER: We'll keep it to ourselves.
(Archer starts up the holographic database projector.)
T'POL: A Vulcan cruiser. I don't recognise the configuration.
ARCHER: That's because it hasn't been built yet.
T'POL: Few Vulcans have ever chosen to mate with another species.
ARCHER: Worried about contaminating your genome with a little human
DNA?
T'POL: There are significant biological differences between the
species. It's unlikely we could reproduce. Humans and Vulcans.
ARCHER: (searching for the Tardis) That could be it.
T'POL: The dorsal section is the wrong shape.
ARCHER: (carries on scrolling through) If a human and a Vulcan did have
a child, I wonder if he'd have pointed ears. There. I think that's it.
Look at the commission date. That's almost nine hundred years from now.
Daniels talked about historians from the future. People who traveled
back to study the past. That could be what this pilot was doing.
T'POL: This says it's powered by a temporal displacement drive.
ARCHER: If the Suliban get their hands on this, they'll take it apart,
(switches off display) maybe learn how the engines work. That could
change the course of the Temporal Cold War.
T'POL: Assuming the vessel is from the future, why haven't they
retrieved it?
ARCHER: (answers comm. beep) Archer.
TRAVIS [OC]: Sir, there's an alien vessel's approaching at high warp.
ARCHER: Suliban?
TRAVIS [OC]: No, sir. We can't identify them.
 [Bridge]
 (A dart-like ship is gaining from the stern.)
TRAVIS: Twenty thousand kilometres and closing.
ARCHER: T'Pol?
T'POL: The vessel's Tholian. They're extremely xenophobic. The High
Command has had limited contact with them. Captain, it's unusual for
Tholians to travel this far from their system.
REED: I'm getting unusual thermal readings. It's awfully warm inside
that ship, more than two hundred degrees.
T'POL: They're believe to be a non-humanoid species.
ARCHER: Open a channel. This is Captain Archer of the Starship
THOLIAN [OC]: (punctuated by hisses and whistles) Jonathan Archer,
please establish communication.
ARCHER: Is there something we can do for you?
THOLIAN [OC]: We were sent to retrieve the vessel.
ARCHER: I'd like to know how you heard about that ship.
THOLIAN: It is dangerous to you. Temporal radiation.
ARCHER: Thanks for the warning, but we can't give it to you.
T'POL: They've locked on to us with a tractor beam.
TRAVIS: We're losing speed.
ARCHER: Hull plating. Arm the aft torpedoes.
REED: That beam's interfering with our targeting scanners.
ARCHER: Release us, or I'll destroy the ship in our launch bay. (no
reply) Do you hear me?
(The tractor beam is released and the ship flies off, sending a final
untranslated message.)
ARCHER: What did he say?
HOSHI: I don't know, but I don't think he was paying you a compliment.
ARCHER: I wonder if there's anyone else who thinks they have a claim on
that ship.
 [Mess hall]
 PHLOX: May I join you?
T'POL: Please.
PHLOX: I found another nucleotide sequence in the pilot's genome. It
appears to be Rigelian. That corpse is full of surprises. (tastes his
meal) I didn't realise how late it was until my stomach reminded me it
was time to eat. You seem to be engrossed in your work as well.
T'POL: The Captain asked me to perform a metallurgical analysis of the
vessel's hull.
PHLOX: Anything noteworthy?
T'POL: I've discovered several unusual alloys. One of them is in a
semi-fluidic state.
PHLOX: More mysteries.
T'POL: To say the least.
PHLOX: I understand Captain Archer believes that the vessel travelled
here from the future.
T'POL: That's his theory.
PHLOX: Genetic anomalies, unexplainable alloys, the evidence seems to
be mounting.
T'POL: Perhaps.
PHLOX: The Vulcan Science Directorate. They've always been rather
reluctant to embrace unorthodox ideas. After they review our findings,
I have a feeling they might reconsider their opinion of time travel.
T'POL: It's not an opinion. It's simple logic.
PHLOX: There was a time when Denobulans believed they were the only
intelligent species in the galaxy. Needless to say, it was quite a
surprise when the B'Saari made First Contact. Many refused to accept
the truth even with the evidence standing right in front of them. It
took some time, and it wasn't easy, but eventually we were forced to
reevaluate our beliefs.
T'POL: Are you saying you believe time travel is possible?
PHLOX: Surprises, Sub-Commander. I believe in embracing surprises.
T'POL: I prefer to embrace logic. If you'll excuse me, Doctor.
PHLOX: Good night.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: All right, let's start reinitialising the
power grid.
REED: Assuming that is the power grid. It boggles the mind, if you
think about it.
TUCKER: What does?
REED: That ship could be from the thirty first century. When I was
young, I always wanted to build a time machine, see the future.
TUCKER: You're probably the kind of person that jumps to the end of a
book before you read it.
REED: Don't tell me you've never wondered what it would be like. How
our mission will turn out.
TUCKER: Wondering about the future and knowing it are two different
things.
REED: If Daniels came here and offered you a chance to go to the thirty
first century, you wouldn't take it?
TUCKER: Some things are better left a mystery.
REED: And you call yourself an explorer.
TUCKER: Where's the fun in exploring if you know how it all turns out?
Hand me that micro-caliper. Suppose you could look into some future
book and find out the name of the woman you're going to marry. Would
you want to know it?
REED: Absolutely. Think of all the awkward first dates I could avoid.
TUCKER: Fine. So one day you meet Jane Doe. You go out a few times, and
you pop the question. She says I do, and the two you live happily ever
after.
REED: Sounds perfect.
TUCKER: Now, did you marry her for love, or because some book told you
to?
REED: If we're happily ever after, what difference does it make?
TUCKER: Well, we've got power. Now we've got to figure out how to tap
into these organic circuits.
REED: They're similar to the ones in the cockpit.
TUCKER: We might be able to salvage some of them, build an interface.
 [Launch bay two]
 TUCKER: Now if I had a chance to see the past, I'd
jump at it. I always wanted to meet a stegosaurus.
REED: He'd probably make a quick meal of you.
TUCKER: The stegosaurus was an herbivore.
REED: If I could travel back in time, I know exactly what year I'd
pick. 1588.
TUCKER: What happened in 1588?
REED: England defeated the Spanish Armada.
TUCKER: I'm sure some named Reed had a lot to do with that.
(They haul a plate off the Tardis exterior)
TUCKER: (entering the bay) Now if I had a chance to see the past, I'd
jump at it. I always wanted to meet a stegosaurus.
REED: He'd probably make a quick meal of you.
TUCKER: The stegosaurus was an herbivore.
REED: It seems like we were just in here. If I could travel back, I
know exactly what year I'd pick.
BOTH: 1588.
TUCKER: How'd I know you were going to say that?
REED: I think we're spending far too much time together.
(They haul a plate off the Tardis exterior - again)
TUCKER: (entering the bay) Now, if I had a chance to see the past, I'd
jump at it.
REED: I always wanted to meet a stegosaurus.
TUCKER: He'd probably make a quick meal of you.
REED: The stegosaurus was a herbivore.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER: It was the weirdest thing. When we were
standing next to the ship, it felt like we were having the same
conversation over and over again.
PHLOX: I can't find anything wrong with either of you.
REED: We didn't imagine what happened.
[Situation room]
(T'Pol is studying the large display table.)
T'POL: Captain, the craft is emitting some type of high-energy
particles.
(They go down the steps to join her.)
ARCHER: This may be the temporal radiation the Tholians warned us
about.
REED: We've spent a fair amount of time around that ship.
PHLOX: The particle density's quite low. It's unlikely to have any
lasting effects.
TUCKER: How do you explain what happened?
T'POL: The radiation could have affected your perception of time.
ARCHER: Or maybe they really were reliving the same moment. Seal off
Launch bay two and evacuate the surrounding sections. I don't want to
take any chances. (Reed leaves) How are you coming with the black box?
TUCKER: The power's online, but we still can't access the data.
ARCHER: Let me know as soon as you find anything. Dismissed.
T'POL: Can I speak with you?
 [Ready room]
 T'POL: The radiation could spread to other
sections, affect more systems.
ARCHER: We'll keep an eye on it. The Vulcans are only a few hours away.
T'POL: I'm not certain we'll survive that long. We've attracted the
attention of two hostile species. It's logical to assume they're
searching for us.
ARCHER: I'm pretty sure we can steer clear of them.
T'POL: Perhaps you should destroy the vessel.
ARCHER: I'm not going to do that. I'm tired of these factions
interfering with our century. It's time we took a more active interest
in this war, gathered some intelligence ourselves.
T'POL: Assuming for the moment the Temporal Cold War exists, I believe
we shouldn't get involved.
ARCHER: Like it or not, we've been involved since we left Spacedock.
Daniel's hinted that there were other factions in this conflict. Maybe
the Tholians are working for one of them.
T'POL: Your curiosity is placing Enterprise in unnecessary danger.
ARCHER: This is the first chance we've had to get some answers. I'm not
going to pass it up. The Vulcans can get that ship back to Earth in a
few weeks. Starfleet'll take it from there.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: I told you. I've made my decision.
T'POL: If the Suliban return, they may be cloaked. I recommend we go to
Tactical Alert.
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER: What do you have?
TUCKER: It's what we don't have. This isn't a black box. We thought it
was a data storage matrix, but after we got the power running it
started generating a subspace signature. I think it's a
micro-transmitter, some kind of emergency beacon.
T'POL [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer. Several Suliban vessels are
approaching.
ARCHER: On my way.
T'POL [OC]: Acknowledged.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: The ships will be within weapons range in
twenty seconds.
ARCHER: Go to maximum warp.
T'POL: They're matching our speed.
ARCHER: How long to the rendezvous point?
T'POL: Less than three minutes.
ARCHER: Contact the Tal'Kir. Let them know we're bringing company.
HOSHI: No response. We're being hailed by the Suliban.
(She puts them onscreen.)
ARCHER: I see you brought some friends with you.
SULIBAN [on viewscreen]: Drop out of warp and prepare to be boarded.
ARCHER: Or what? You're not going to risk any more damage to that ship.
REED: They're charging weapons.
ARCHER: Take a look at your long-range sensors. There's a Vulcan combat
cruiser a few million kilometres from here. Unless you want to upset
them, I suggest you turn around.
SULIBAN [on viewscreen]: The Vulcans won't risk their ship for an Earth
vessel.
(Ends transmission and fires at Enterprise)
ARCHER: Aft cannon, return fire.
(they hit a couple of ships, but take more hits themselves)
REED: We're losing ventral plating.
ARCHER: The Vulcans?
T'POL: Six hundred thousand kilometres.
REED: Direct hit to the launch bay doors. They're trying to blast them
open.
ARCHER: Hold your course and speed.
T'POL: Two hundred thousand kilometres.
ARCHER: Take us out of warp.
(the Tal'Kir doesn't look at all well)
ARCHER: Biosigns?
T'POL: The crew's alive. The vessel is disabled.
HOSHI: Their comm. system's down.
TRAVIS: Captain.
(Enter the Tholians)
ARCHER: Take us back to warp.
(The Tholians get several direct hits on Enterprise.)
TRAVIS: Engines are down.
ARCHER: Weapons?
REED: They're offline, too. The hull plating's depolarising.
T'POL: The cell ships have dropped out of warp.
(The Suliban and Tholians begin fighting each other.)
REED: I never thought I'd be glad to see the Suliban.
ARCHER: Trip, we could use warp engines
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER [OC]: Right about now.
TUCKER: The antimatter injectors are fused. I'll need a few hours to
replace them.
ARCHER [OC]: How about weapons?
TUCKER: Every power relay on the ship's been scrambled.
ARCHER [OC]: Then forget everything else. Get that beacon working.
TUCKER: Sir?
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Whoever built that ship might be able to
send help.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Aye, Captain.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Even if you're correct, it's unlikely help
will arrive in time.
ARCHER: How long would it take to remove one of the torpedo warheads,
arm it manually?
REED: Four minutes. Less if I had some help. I recommend moving the
warhead as little as possible once we remove it.
ARCHER: Then we'll bring the torpedo to the launch bay, work on it
there. (to T'Pol) You have the bridge.
 [Launch bay two]
 ARCHER: I'm going to hold you to that four
minutes.
REED: It was only an estimate, sir.
ARCHER: They don't make this easy, do they?
REED: I'm going to release the couplings. You'll need to disconnect the
power conduits. The blue and red ones first. Turn the release
counterclockwise until you feel it detach.
 [Engineering]
 CREWMAN: Commander.
TUCKER: I need that power module.
CREWMAN: Yes, sir.
(the box powers up)
TUCKER: All right, hand me a micro-caliper.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Bridge to Captain Archer.
 [Launch bay two]
(Archer takes his communicator out of a sleeve
pocket.)
 ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: The Suliban have lost more than half of their ships.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: You don't have much time.
ARCHER [OC]: We're working as fast as we can.
 [Launch bay two]
 ARCHER: Stand by.
REED: Sir, if you'll hold it by the locking brace.
(They remove the warhead. Archer
helps to undo the casing.) 
ARCHER: I'm going to hold you to that four minutes.
REED: It was only an estimate, sir. It's happening again. We've had
this conversation before.
ARCHER: You're right. How far do you think we got last time?
REED: I'm not certain.
ARCHER: I think we may have removed the warhead.
REED: If time's not repeating outside the launch bay, the Tholians
could be close.
ARCHER: We'd better hurry. The red and blue conduits, right?
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: The Cell-Ships. They've been destroyed.
T'POL: How many?
TRAVIS: All of them. The Tholians are on an intercept course.
HOSHI: They're hailing us.
THOLIAN [OC]: Give us the vessel.
T'POL: We're prepared to surrender it to you, but our launch bay doors
took heavy damage. We're going to need more time. I have a repair team
working on it, but they estimate it will take
TRAVIS: Two of their ships are approaching the saucer section. Eighty
metres. forty.
HOSHI: They've locked on to both docking ports.
T'POL: Seal the hatches and send security teams.
 [Launch bay two]
(Archer removes the warhead.)
 ARCHER: Get to the control room. I'll take it from
here.
REED: Aye, Captain.
(Archer places the warhead inside the Tardis.)
ARCHER: I'm going to hold you to that four minutes.
REED: It was only an estimate, sir.
ARCHER: How many times do you think we've done this?
REED: At least twice, maybe more.
ARCHER: Let's hope we've got it down by now.
 [Bridge]
 (As teams take up positions, and the Tholians
start cutting the hatches.)
HOSHI: They're cutting through the doors.
 [Launch bay two]
 ARCHER: Control room.
(He puts the warhead in the Tardis and Tucker gets the temporal beacon
signal going.)
ARCHER: Let's get those doors open.
(The Tardis drops out into space and a Tholian ship takes it in tow.)
ARCHER: Now.
REED: I'd recommend putting more distance between us and that ship.
ARCHER: Now!
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
 [Launch bay two control room]
 T'POL [OC]: They've neutralised the warhead.
ARCHER: On our way.
(In Engineering, the future transmitter vanishes from under Trip's
nose, and Phlox watches his corpse disappear from Sickbay too. Suddenly
the Tholian ship is towing - nothing.)
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Sir, it's gone.
ARCHER: Gone?
T'POL: It dematerialised, and it's not aboard the Tholian ships.
HOSHI: They're disengaging.
(The four dart ships go to warp.)
ARCHER: Why didn't they fire on us?
REED: Good question.
T'POL: They may have only wanted the vessel.
ARCHER: The Vulcans?
T'POL: Their warp drive is damaged, but life support is stable.
ARCHER: Let's see if we can give them a hand. (to Reed) Prep a
shuttlepod. Have Doctor Phlox meet us in Launch bay one.
HOSHI: Aye, sir.
 Captain's Starlog, supplemental. A Vulcan
transport is en route to tow the Tal'Kir. Fortunately, there were no
casualties. Our long range scanners show no sign of Tholians or Suliban
in our vicinity.
 [Captain's mess]
 TUCKER: I wish we'd had more time to explore that
ship. Who knows how many other rooms were down there? Looks like they
sent the whole kit and caboodle back to the thirty first century.
T'POL: There's no evidence to support that.
TUCKER: Well, there's no evidence to contradict it, either. What I
don't understand is how quickly everything disappeared. That beacon was
online for less than a minute.
ARCHER: You're forgetting that time is irrelevant to these people.
TUCKER: Irrelevant?
ARCHER: If that vessel was from the future, whoever sent it had plenty
of time to locate the signal and then travel back to any point in time
to retrieve it.
TUCKER: Unfortunately, time isn't irrelevant in my engine room. I've
got repairs to finish. See you later. Sub-Commander.
(Tucker leaves.)
ARCHER: I'm going to contact the High Command, apologise for the
trouble we caused them.
T'POL: As the captain of the Tal'Kir pointed out, a ship can be
replaced.
ARCHER: I also need to thank them for helping us out.
T'POL: I'm sure the gesture would be appreciated. The High Command has
asked me to prepare a report on this incident, with your permission.
ARCHER: By all means. I wonder if they'll believe that humans and
Vulcans will be swapping chromosomes one day?
T'POL: They're more likely to believe in time travel.

    Original Airdate: Feb 26, 2003
[Shuttlepod]
      (The pod is adrift, with burn marks on the hull. Inside, the gravity is off and a PADD is floating around.)
      HOSHI [OC]: Enterprise to Shuttlepod One. Enterprise to Shuttlepod One. Captain Archer
     
 [Bridge]
      HOSHI: Please respond. Enterprise to Shuttlepod One. Captain Archer, please respond.
      T'POL: Lieutenant?
      REED: They took some weapons fire. Main power's offline. Gravity plating, life support.
      T'POL: Biosigns?
      REED: None. [Situation room](A little later, in the situation room at the back of the Bridge.)
      ARCHER [OC]: Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Trip and I have left Keto-Enol, where we had
      a successful first contact with the Enolians. We also found time to squeeze in a little R + R. 
      HOSHI: There's only one more log entry after that. Something about a pan zan match.
      REED: Pan zan?
      HOSHI: It's a sporting event. The Captain said it was the closest thing to water polo he's seen
      since we left Earth.
      T'POL: Sensor logs? 
      REED: Too badly damaged to be much help.
      PHLOX: If I may, I've been running a forensic analysis. There are traces of human blood on the
      deck and bulkheads, both the Captain's and Commander Tucker's. Lieutenant Reed believes they were abducted.
      REED: If they were, they didn't go without a fight.
      T'POL: Set a course for Keto-Enol.
     
 [Prison transport - Bridge]
      GUARD: I'll be right back.
      (He gets a rifle from a locker, then heads back into the main passenger area of the ship, where the
      prisoners are being held under guard, in shackles.)
     
 [Prison transport]
      TUCKER: (whispers across the gangway) Captain.
      ARCHER: You in charge here? If you're not, I need to speak to your superior officer.
      (The guard triggers a painful punishment via the wrist restraints.)
      TUCKER: Captain?
      ARCHER: I'm okay. (The person sitting on the bench in front of Archer speaks.)
      KURODA: I'd stay quiet if I were you.
      The guards don't like questions.
      ARCHER: Do you know where they're taking us? I heard something about Canamar. I assume that's where we're going.
      ZOUMAS: (next to Trip) It's a penal colony.
      TUCKER: Is this how your justice system works? Ship people off to prison without a trial?      
      ZOUMAS: There's a processing station in orbit. You'll be tried, sentenced, and sent down to the surface.
      TUCKER: What if you're not guilty?
      ZOUMAS: We're all guilty as far as they're concerned. Why did they take you?
      ARCHER: They think we're smugglers.
      ZOUMAS: I wouldn't want to be accused of smuggling. They'll probably make an example of you.
     
 [Bridge]
      T'POL: We're on an exploratory mission. We believe our Captain and Chief Engineer were abducted
      after visiting your planet.
      ENOLIAN [on viewscreen]: (he's the same species as the guards on the prison ship) Abducted by whom?
      T'POL: We don't know.
      ENOLIAN [on viewscreen]: We're the busiest trading outpost in this system. We get thousands of visitors
      every day. Unfortunately, that attracts just as many thieves and smugglers. As you might imagine,
      my officers are kept quite busy. I wish I could help you.
      T'POL: Let us send you their descriptions. Perhaps you could find out if any of your officers
      have seen them.
     
 [Prison transport]
      (Bowls of porridge-like stuff are being handed out to the prisoners.)
      TUCKER: Anything else on the menu?
      NAUSICAAN: (sitting behind Tucker) If you don't like it, give it to me.
      TUCKER: I like it just fine.
      NAUSICAAN: Give it to me.
      TUCKER: Eat your own.
      NAUSICAAN: You don't listen too well.
      TUCKER: Then why don't you save yourself the trouble and stop talking to me?
      (The Nausicaan leaps to his feet, and is promptly brought down by the punishment device.)
      TUCKER: Thanks. (he gets a zap for his civility too)
      ZOUMAS: You should be careful with the Nausicaans. Nasty tempers.
      TUCKER: Thanks for the advice.
      ZOUMAS: What were you smuggling? Latinum, Enolian spice wine?
      TUCKER: We're not smugglers. I'm the Chief Engineer of a starship. He's my Captain.
      ZOUMAS: Captain of a starship? Interesting. I should have tried that when they took me.
      It might have helped. Captain Zoumas.
     
 [Situation room]
      ENOLIAN: A patrol ship intercepted their shuttle as it was leaving orbit.
      T'POL: Where are they?
      ENOLIAN: On board one of our transports. They were carrying what appeared to be contraband,
      so they were taken into custody.
      REED: Are your patrols in the habit of arresting innocent people?
      ENOLIAN: Smuggling is rampant in this system. My men have orders to board unfamiliar vessels.
      Mistakes can be made.
      REED: You certainly made one this time.
      ENOLIAN: I've contacted the transport. They're expecting you. These are the co-ordinates.
      T'POL: I trust you'll accompany us to ensure there are no further mistakes.
     
 [Prison transport]
      TUCKER: What if Enterprise doesn't find the shuttlepod?
      ARCHER: Hopefully, there'll be a judge or someone on that processing station we can talk to.
      TUCKER: And if not?
      ARCHER: You might want to make friends with that Nausicaan.
      GUARD: Are you Archer? You're being released. A ship's coming to retrieve you.
      PRISONER: Released? Why?
      TUCKER: We're not criminals.
      NAUSICAAN: How much did they pay you to let them go?
      GUARD: Quiet.
      NAUSICAAN: I'm innocent, too. I'll pay you.
      GUARD: I said, quiet.
      NAUSICAAN: We're all innocent! How much?!
      (In the distraction, the man in front of Archer releases his restraints.)
      GUARD: That's enough! Keep still! All of you.
      (The freed prisoner knocks him out and the other guard out then uses the guard's device to release the Nausicaan, who
      starts kicking the downed Enolian before throwing his weapon to Kuroda.)
      KURODA: Keep still, all of you, if you want to get out of here.
      (An alarm sounds as they try to get into the Bridge. One officer there gets a weapon, goes into the prisoner's
      area and is promptly shot, then the Nausicaan forces his way through the doors to beat up the pilot. The
      defeated Enolians are put in shackles with the rest of the prisoners.)
      KURODA: I told you we needed the pilot.
      NAUSICAAN: He's alive.
      KURODA: Does he look like he's in any condition to fly this ship?
      NAUSICAAN: He tried to get a weapon.
      KURODA: Just watch them!
      PRISONER: What about the rest of us?
      KURODA: You'll be released soon enough.
      PRISONER: When? Where are we going?
      KURODA: Be patient. You'll find out.
      ZOUMAS: I'm sure we're all grateful for your courageous effort, but we've been in these restraints for three days.
      Couldn't you 
      KURODA: Quiet! I'll see if I can access navigation.
      ARCHER: You ever fly a warp ship before? It's harder than you think.
      TUCKER: He's right.
      ARCHER: You hit the wrong control, you could overload the plasma manifolds or shut down the
      antimatter containment field. We'd all end up a cloud of ionised gas.
      KURODA: You're a pilot?
      ARCHER: A damn good one. I'm a smuggler, remember?
      KURODA: Come with me. (He releases Archer's shackles.)
      ARCHER: My partner's an engineer. I could use his help.
      KURODA: Just you.
      (The Nausicaan stands guard as the pair go forward.)
     
 [Prison transport Bridge]
      (Archer examines the alien controls carefully.)
      KURODA: I thought you were a pilot.
      ARCHER: Every ship's different. Give me some time. (He takes the right hand seat.) ARCHER: These look like landing thrusters,
      attitude control, warp stabilizers.
      KURODA: Navigation? (Archer touches a screen and gets a schematic of the stars.)
      ARCHER: Navigation.
      KURODA: There's a binary system four light years from here.
      ARCHER: This one?
      KURODA: Set a course.
      ARCHER: Which planet?
      KURODA: I'll tell you that when we get there.
      ARCHER: We're not going to get very far in a stolen
      KURODA: Just get me to that system.
      (The ship changes course.)
     
 [Prison transport]
      (The pilot is still unconscious.)
      GUARD: You know what happens if he dies. If you get him medical attention, it'll work in your favour.
      I'll tell the magistrate you showed compassion. (He gets a punishment zap.)
     
 [Prison transport Bridge]
      KURODA: The guard said you were going to be released. Why?
      ARCHER: Because we're innocent. I have friends who wanted to keep doing business with me.
      They made a few discreet payments and now I'm innocent. I would have been off this ship by now
      if you hadn't staged your little revolt. I hope you've thought this through.
      KURODA: Every detail.
      ARCHER: I'm curious. How'd you get out of those restraints? You couldn't have
      a lock pick, the guards would have found it.
      KURODA: (shows his wrists) Would they? Subdermal implants. They depolarise triburnium alloys.
      ARCHER: How did you know you were going to need them?
      KURODA: I served seven years on Canamar before I escaped. I don't intend to go back.
      So, I left prepared.
      ARCHER: (changes seats) I don't know what you have in mind, but I'm involved now.
      I don't want to go to Canamar any more than you do. If we run into trouble, my partner could help.
      KURODA: What is that?
      ARCHER: Subspace transceiver.
      KURODA: I hope you're not trying to send a message.
      ARCHER: I'm taking it offline. It leaves a subspace signature. Even when it's not transmitting,
      someone could track us. (Kuroda smashes it with his gun.)
      KURODA: Now it's offline.
     
 [Bridge]
      HOSHI: I'm picking up an automated distress signal.
      ENOLIAN: That's one of our frequencies.
      T'POL: Your transport vessel?
      ENOLIAN: We have hundreds of ships. I don't know the signatures for every one.
      HOSHI: The signal originated near our rendezvous coordinates, but they've stopped transmitting.
      T'POL: Try hailing them.
      HOSHI: No response.
      T'POL: Increase our speed to warp four point two.
      ENOLIAN: We're still several hours away but we have patrol ships in that area.
      T'POL: Contact them.
     
 [Prison transport]
      ZOUMAS: Have you ever tried Tojal?
      TUCKER: What?
      ZOUMAS: There's nothing like it, but you have to eat it before it cools, otherwise it'll congeal.
      TUCKER: Sounds terrific.
      ZOUMAS: It's the first thing I'm going to have when we're off this ship. Where do you think they're taking us?
      TUCKER: Ask him.
      ZOUMAS: I'll just wait and see. The Enolians won't stop looking for us. We'll be fugitives.
      I was thinking of having my face reconfigured. There's a surgeon on Burala Prime who can do it.
      He could help you as well.
      TUCKER: I'll take my chances with my own face.
      ZOUMAS: Have you ever been to Burala Prime?
      TUCKER: Can't say I have.
      ZOUMAS: If you ever go, avoid the polar islands. The people are friendly, but the cold
      is unbearable. Nothing but ice and glaciers. I was stranded there for three months
      when some colleagues of mine decided to leave without me.
      TUCKER: Imagine that.
      ZOUMAS: The day I got lost, that was the worst. Fourteen hours. It took me fourteen hours to find my way
      back to the outpost. I lost three toes to frostbite. I've walked with a slight limp ever since,
      not that you'd notice. I'm going to get that surgeon to do some work on my foot as well.
      Maybe he can replace the missing toes.
      TUCKER: Excuse me. Can I change seats? (The Nausicaan laughs)
     
 [Prison transport Bridge]
      KURODA: I'm surprised we haven't crossed paths before.
      ARCHER: We're new to this region. We used to work mostly in the Sol system.
      KURODA: Sol?
      ARCHER: That's our sun. Our homeworld is called Earth.
      (An alarm goes off.)
      KURODA: What is it?
      ARCHER: Two vessels approaching from aft.
      KURODA: Let me see them. (He brings up an image on the navigation screen.)  KURODA: Enolian patrol ships. 
      ARCHER: They've found us.
      KURODA: More quickly than I expected. When you were taking the transceiver offline,
      you didn't activate it accidentally?
      ARCHER: You think I sent a distress call? I told you we should have gotten rid of this ship.
      It's too easy to track. They're charging weapons.
      KURODA: Do the same.
      ARCHER: Those are heavily armed patrol ships. We're only a transport.
      KURODA: We have weapons. use them.
      ARCHER: We're outgunned. I'd rather take my chances on Canamar.
      KURODA: And I'd rather not. Now charge the weapons.
      (The ship is hit.)
      ARCHER: They're targeting our engines.
      KURODA: Return fire!
      ARCHER: No.
      KURODA: I'm warning you.
      ARCHER: We don't have the firepower. If we attack those ships, they'll destroy us.
      I think I can get us out of this, but I'll need Tucker's help.
     
 [Prison transport]
      ZOUMAS: What's happening?
      GUARD: If those are patrol ships, you're going to be recaptured.
      ZOUMAS: Shouldn't we be getting to the escape pods?
      NAUSICAAN: The next person who speaks goes out the airlock. He needs to concentrate.
      (Tucker has been released and is working on something in a bulkhead.)
     
 [Prison transport Bridge]
      ARCHER: Trip, what's your status?
      TUCKER [OC}: Almost there.
     
 [Prison transport]
      ZOUMAS: Let us go! I don't want to die tied up like an animal!
      (The Nausicaan gives him a punishment zap.)
      TUCKER: Ready when you are.
     
 [Prison transport Bridge]
      KURODA: (over communicator) Cease fire, cease fire. We surrender.
      (It all goes quiet.)
      ENOLIAN 2 [OC]: Pressurize your docking port and prepare to be boarded,
      or our next shot will breach your hull.
      KURODA: Acknowledged.
      (As the two ships slowly approach from astern.)
      ARCHER: Now.
     
 [Prison transport]
      TUCKER: The plasma vents are open.
      (A cloud of purple engulfs the two ships, then Archer fires their feeble phase cannon into it.
      The explosion doesn't blow the ships up.)
     
 [Prison transport Bridge]
      ARCHER: They've taken damage. Propulsion is down on both ships.
      KURODA: Lock weapons.
      ARCHER: We should get out of here while we can.
      KURODA: Target their warp reactors.
      ARCHER: There's no need.
      KURODA: As soon as they repair the damage they'll come after us again.
      ARCHER: Do you think the Enolians are just going to give up if we destroy two of their ships?
      All I'm wanted for is smuggling. I don't need to add murder charges to it.
      Let me get us out of here.
      KURODA: All right.
     
 [Prison transport]
      [The Nausicaan puts Tucker back in shackles.)
      TUCKER: Is this really necessary? I just saved your skin and you still don't trust me.
      Do you know how much power flows through those plasma conduits?
      ZOUMAS: How much?
      TUCKER: A lot. I could have been electrocuted. The least you could do is say thanks.
      NAUSICAAN: Thanks.
      ZOUMAS: That was nice. It reminds me of the time I was on
      TUCKER: Shut up!
     
 [Situation room]
      ENOLIAN: Both our ships were disabled before the transport escaped.
      My superiors don't want our patrols taking any more chances. They've issued orders to destroy the prison transport.
      T'POL: Are your superiors aware that there are two innocent humans aboard?
      ENOLIAN: They're more concerned with the man who planned this escape. They were able to match his voice-print
      to a prisoner named Kuroda Lor-ehn. He was responsible for many crimes, some of them brutal.
      They're determined to stop him.
      REED: And we're determined to get our people back.
      ENOLIAN: Then I suggest you find them before our patrols do.
     
 [Prison transport Bridge]
      KURODA: That was a clever trick, igniting the plasma.
      ARCHER: I used it once before, outrunning a customs vessel near Coridan.
      KURODA: You obviously ran out of clever tricks, otherwise you wouldn't be here. What happened?
      ARCHER: Every ship leaving Keto-Enol was being boarded and searched.
      To get through the checkpoint, I said I was a starship captain and Tucker was my engineer.
      I made quite a point about how I was on a peaceful mission of exploration.
      KURODA: They didn't believe you?
      ARCHER: What do you think? They turned our shuttle inside out, found my cargo, and we wound up here.
      KURODA: My good fortune. You should consider coming with us. Your partner, too.
      ARCHER: Doing what?
      KURODA: I have some business I wasn't able to finish before I was arrested. It could be profitable.
      ARCHER: I'm a smuggler. I'm not good at much else.
      KURODA: Trust me, you'll be very interested when you find out what I have in mind.
      ARCHER: It's not as if I have a lot of options right now. Before we're going to work together,
      I'd like to know where we're headed.
      KURODA: The fourth planet. There's a trading outpost called Tamaal.
      ARCHER: And then?
      KURODA: A ship's going to meet us there. This transport draws too much attention.
     
 [Prison transport]
      ZOUMAS: Once you get past the texture, they really don't taste that bad.
      The fun part is keeping them in your mouth. They jump around until you crunch down on them.
      TUCKER: Enough.
      ZOUMAS: Is something wrong?
      TUCKER: No. I love hearing how delicious Melvaran mud fleas are or about the time you spent
      two hours with an Orion slave girl or the miracles doctors can perform these days, getting rid of Fluvian fungus!
      ZOUMAS: Well, what makes you think I want to hear your stories?
      TUCKER: I haven't told you any. You won't let me get a word in edgewise.
      I can't even put my fingers in my ears. Ten minutes, that's all I'm asking. Just ten minutes of silence.
ZOUMAS: I didn't realise I was being so annoying. We seemed to be
getting along so well. I just thought it might be nice to have a
pleasant conversation before I spend the next ten years in a penal
colony.
      TUCKER: Look, I'm sorry I snapped at you, but this isn't exactly the best place to socialise.
     
 [Prison transport Engineering]
      ARCHER: This thruster assembly took a lot of damage. We should have Tucker take a look at it.
      KURODA: Don't bother.
      ARCHER: You're not the one who has to fly this thing.
      KURODA: It won't be flying much longer. (the Nausicaan enters with a bowl) I'm not hungry.
      NAUSICAAN: You haven't eaten for two days.
      KURODA: I can wait.
      NAUSICAAN: Don't be a fool.
      KURODA: I said I'm not hungry. (The Nausicaan leaves.)  KURODA: Prison rations!
      ARCHER: It's better than nothing.
      KURODA: You've obviously never spent time on a penal colony. I was fourteen when I first tasted those rations.
      I've had enough for one lifetime.
      ARCHER: Sounds like you started your career early.
      KURODA: I was young, but I was no criminal.
      ARCHER: No?
      KURODA: My father and I were working at a transport yard on Keto-Enol. A supervisor
      accused me of stealing a brace of latinum. I had nothing to do with it,
      but they couldn't find anyone else to blame. I was sentenced to five years at Duronom.
      ARCHER: That sounds pretty severe.
      KURODA: Enolian Guards are known for their severity. Haven't you seen that by now?
      I learned far more in prison than my father could have ever taught me.
      After I was released, I chose to put my new skills to use. I suppose I should be grateful.
      If it wasn't for the Enolian Guard, my life would have been quite dull.
     
 [Prison transport Bridge]
      (The transport drops out of warp near a binary system.)
      ARCHER: Welcome to Tamaal. Where are your friends?
      KURODA: They'll be here.
      ARCHER: Do you have landing coordinates?
      KURODA: We're not landing. They're going to dock with us.
      ARCHER: What about the others? Are you going to let them go to prison?
      KURODA: No. Before we leave, you're going to set this ship on a decaying orbit. 
      ARCHER: It'll be incinerated.
      KURODA: As far as anyone will be able to tell, we crashed trying to land.
      ARCHER: Why kill all these people? Just leave them.
      KURODA: No one will be looking for us if they think we're dead.
      If you don't like it, you can always go back to your seat.
      I may not know how to fly this ship, but I'm sure I can figure out how to crash it.
     
 [Bridge]
      TRAVIS: The transport's dropped out of warp. It's entered a binary system.
      Looks like they're heading for the fourth planet.
      ENOLIAN: Tamaal. It's a large trading outpost with over two million inhabitants.
      REED: A good place to get lost in the crowd.
      T'POL: Drop to impulse. Take us into the system. Any human biosigns?
      REED: Two. It's them. I recommend we use the transporter once we're in range.
      ENOLIAN: You're forgetting that's a prison ship. It's heavily shielded.
     
 [Prison transport]
      NAUSICAAN: Where you going?
      ARCHER: The docking hatch was damaged by the patrol ships. Kuroda wants Tucker to see if he can repair it.
      (He holds up a shackle control device and he is let through to the prisoners. Tucker's shackles fall off.)
      TUCKER: Nice of you to visit. 
      PRISONER: Who are we docking with?
      ARCHER: Your guess is as good as mine.
(At the docking hatch controls towards the back of the compartment, the
pair remove a bulkhead as the Nausicaan stands guard.)
      ARCHER: He's taking us off on a shuttle. Then he plans to crash the ship.
      TUCKER: I hope you've got something else in mind.
      ARCHER: We can't wait for Enterprise. We've got to try to take control. Think you can handle him?
      TUCKER: Yeah, piece of cake.
     
 [Bridge]
      TRAVIS: There's a small vessel dropping out of warp.
      T'POL: Patrol ship?
      REED: I don't think so. Four biosigns. They're all Enolian. (The Enolian looks at the image on the viewscreen.)
      ENOLIAN: It's not one of our ships.
      T'POL: Magnify. Where's it heading?
      TRAVIS: The fourth planet.
      HOSHI: They're trying to hail the prison transport. They're not getting a response.
      T'POL: They may have come to rescue Kuroda. How heavily armed is it?
      REED: Fore and aft particle cannons. Nothing we can't handle.
     
 [Prison transport Bridge]
      KURODA: My friends will be here soon. Lay in a descent course.
      ARCHER: Their ship might be big enough to hold everyone here. Why don't we take them along?
      KURODA: We have already discussed this! (Archer touches several controls before activating the comm.)
      ARCHER: Trip.
     
 [Prison transport docking port]
      ARCHER [OC]: How's that docking port coming? (Tucker is straining at a wheel.)
      TUCKER: I need a minute. It's a big job.
     
 [Prison transport Bridge]
      ARCHER: Do your best.
     
 [Prison transport docking port]
      TUCKER: Listen, I know we kind of got off on the wrong foot. No hard feelings. But now that we're friends,
      I could use a hand.
      NAUSICAAN: You're the engineer.
      TUCKER: True. But I'm having trouble getting the intake valve open. I guess I don't have the muscle for it.
      Unless I'm mistaken, Kuroda wants this hatch repaired. (The Nausicaan puts down the rifle in front of him and reaches into
      the open bulkhead.) TUCKER: That one. If you could turn it counter-clockwise. Yeah, a little more.
      It's got to go at least ninety degrees. That's it. You almost got it.
      (Tucker hits the Nausicaan over the head with a spare shackle from the wall.)
      PRISONER: What are you doing?
      ZOUMAS: They said they were going to let us go!
      TUCKER: They lied. They're planning to kill you. All of you.
      PRISONER: How do you know that?
      ZOUMAS: You're going to get us sent to Canamar.
      TUCKER: Keep it down. (He tries to get to the Bridge.)
     
 [Prison transport Bridge]
      (An alarm sounds)
      KURODA: (to Archer) Stay here.
     
 [Prison transport]
      (As Kuroda walks out through the door, Tucker is hiding with the rifle.)
      ZOUMAS: Watch out!
      (Kuroda shoots Tucker and returns to the Bridge, gun in hand.)
     
 [Prison transport Bridge]
      ARCHER: Do you know how to repair that docking hatch? It's not easy. We're in a decaying orbit.
      Shoot me and you'll die with the others.
      KURODA: (opening the door) Get to work.
      ARCHER: You don't have to kill these people.
      KURODA: Move!
     
 [Prison transport]
      (Tucker wakes up back in shackles again as the smaller ship comes up alongside the transport.)
      ZOUMAS: You should thank me.
      TUCKER: What? Where's Archer?
      ZOUMAS: He's with them, repairing the docking hatch. They said there's a shuttle coming for us.
      I'm sorry I had to intervene, but you didn't give me much choice. You're lucky they didn't kill you.
      Kuroda was furious, but everything's fine now. They're going to set us free. You're welcome.
      (The ship rocks,)
      ARCHER: They've docked.
      (He goes to the hatch and opens it, and a fire-fight starts between Kuroda and - Reed and his security team.
      Archer is given a phase pistol. The prisoners try to makes themselves as small as possible. Finally Archer gets
      Kuroda as he tries to open the door to the Bridge. Travis checks on a fallen crewman.)
      ARCHER: I see my message got through.
      REED: Loud and clear, sir. (Tucker holds up his shackles.)
      TUCKER: Captain, would you mind?
      ZOUMAS: Who are these people? (Archer hands a device to Reed.)
      ARCHER: This will open the restraints. (The ship rocks again.) ARCHER: Get everyone
      on that shuttle.
      (Archer goes to the Bridge as the ship enters the atmosphere. The prisoners virtually stampede for the docking
      hatch, and the guard carries his companion. We see Kuroda move his head.)
     
 [Prison transport Bridge]
      TUCKER: Anything I can do?
      ARCHER: Not unless you have a spare thruster assembly. Is everyone off?
      TUCKER: Just about.
      ARCHER: I'll be right there.
     
 [Prison transport]
      REED: Captain, Travis says he can't maintain the docking seal much longer.
      ARCHER: He won't have to. Let's go.
      (Reed and Trip haul the Nausicaan out by his feet, and Archer picks up Kuroda, who knocks him over. They fight,
      then Kuroda closes the docking hatch.)
      KURODA: We need to break orbit.
      ARCHER: It's too late. We've lost thrusters.
      KURODA: You're lying!
      ARCHER: We've got to get out!
      (They fight again, and Archer tries to open the hatch. The docking seal is flexing as the joined ships
      buck about in the atmosphere. During the fight, Kuroda takes another shackle from the wall, so Archer uses
      the device to give him a zap. He gets the hatch open, Reed comes in as Kuroda heads for the Bridge.)
      ARCHER: Kuroda. It's over.
      KURODA: I won't go back!
      REED: It's now or never, sir!
      (Kuroda shuts himself in the Bridge. Reed drags Archer onto the shuttle which then disengages and escapes back to
      Enterprise. Then Kuroda discovers that Archer was telling the truth, and braces himself for a fiery death.)
     
 [Enterprise docking port and corridor]
      
     
      ARCHER: We've got some men in there who could use your help.
      PHLOX: And you?
      ARCHER: I'll be fine.
      ENOLIAN: On behalf of the Enolian government, I'd like to extend our apologies for this inconvenience.
      My superiors will want
      ARCHER: Trip. (The pair walk away.)
      ENOLIAN: (following) Er, Captain? Captain, my superiors will want a report on
      ARCHER: I'll give you one right now. Kuroda's dead, the other eleven prisoners are under guard.
      As you're aware, my Engineer and I were falsely arrested. We almost wound up in Canamar.
      Makes me wonder how many others don't belong there. You wanted a report? You've got one.

The Enterprise Transcripts - The Crossing
The
Crossing
 Original Airdate: 2 Apr, 2003
 
 [Bridge]
 REED: Sensors can't identify its hull composition.
There doesn't even seem to be a warp signature.
T'POL: It's approaching at warp six.
ARCHER: How big is it?
REED: It's big, more than five hundred metres across.
HOSHI: We're in visual range.
ARCHER: Put it up. (A big semi-saucer thing comes into view.) ARCHER: Look
familiar?
T'POL: It's not in the Vulcan database.
ARCHER: Try hailing them.
HOSHI: No response, sir. I'm not even detecting a transceiver on board.
TRAVIS: They're gaining on us, sir.
(The pursuing ship breaks open and engulfs little Enterprise.)
REED: What the hell is that?
ARCHER: Tactical alert.
REED: Weapons aren't charging, sir. They're offline. Phase cannons,
torpedoes.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Tucker to the Bridge!
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
TUCKER: What's going on, Captain? The engines just went down.
ARCHER [OC]: Warp or impulse?
TUCKER: Both.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Hold on, Trip. Have they dropped out of
warp?
T'POL: There's no way to tell. Our sensors can't penetrate their hull.
ARCHER: What about our life support?
T'POL: Fully operational.
ARCHER: That's one piece of good news. Any biosigns out there?
T'POL: None that I can detect.
ARCHER: Rotate the dorsal camera.
(The image is of a big chamber, and a circular object ahead of them.)
ARCHER: Hold it there. Tilt up about thirty degrees. Get closer.
(There are wispy things moving around.)
T'POL: The vapour doesn't contain any elements our sensors can
identify.
ARCHER: Any atmosphere?
T'POL: Mostly helium, trace amounts of xenon.
ARCHER: Prep a shuttlepod. Trip, meet me and Malcolm in Launch bay one.
TUCKER [OC]: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: (to T'Pol) You're in charge. Keep a channel open.
 [Alien spaceship]
 (The shuttlepod glides out of the bay down to the
floor of the alien ship, then three space-suited figures climb out.) REED: Captain, look at this. (He holds out a scanner.)
REED: The atmosphere's changing. Seventy six percent nitrogen, twenty one
percent oxygen.
TUCKER: Somebody seems to know what we like to breathe.
ARCHER: What's the temperature?
REED: Eighteen degrees.
TUCKER: Florida in November.
ARCHER: Let's see what we can find.
TUCKER: Look at that.
(The wisps are circling Enterprise.)
REED: I'm not reading anything. It's like they're not there.
TUCKER: They sure look there to me.
REED: If there aren't any life-forms here, then who modified the
atmosphere?
ARCHER: I doubt it's a coincidence.
TUCKER: Captain. (Some light blue wisps swirl around them.)
ARCHER: We may not be detecting any bio-signs, but those things sure
look alive to me.
(One of them gets into Tucker's head, then leaves again, coloured yellow.)
ARCHER: Are you okay? Trip?
(The yellow wisp returns, pops into his head and a white one leaves.)
TUCKER: What the hell happened?
ARCHER: That's what I was about to ask you.
TUCKER: I think I was up on the ceiling with those things. I was
looking down at the three of us, but not with my eyes. I can't explain
it.
ARCHER: We should get him back to the ship.
TUCKER: I was in Tarpon Springs, too, swimming with Lisa. She was
afraid it was getting too dark.
REED: It sounds like you were dreaming, Commander.
TUCKER: I know the difference between a dream and something really
happening.
ARCHER: We're a hundred and fifty light years from Earth, Trip.
TUCKER: I'm telling you, I was there.
 [Sickbay]
 (Trip is in the Decon chamber.)
PHLOX: I'm not detecting any parasites or lifeforms or wisps of smoke.
He seems in perfect working order.
ARCHER: He said he had some kind of out-of-body experience.
TUCKER: I don't forget Florida, Captain. I don't care how far away it
is. I was there. (Phlox cuts off the intercom.)
PHLOX: It's a very common hallucination,
returning to a familiar place.
TUCKER: What happened to the comm.? You three talking about me? (Phlox switches the intercom back on.)
PHLOX: You're clear, Commander. Free
to go.
TUCKER: Thanks, Doc.
 [Locker room]
 (Changing out of the space suits back into their
uniforms.)
ARCHER: You sure you're all right?
TUCKER: I'm fine. I can't believe how amazing it was.
ARCHER: I'd prefer to keep you in Sickbay for a few days, but I can't
afford to. I need you to get those engines back online.
TUCKER: I'll see what I can do.
ARCHER: Let me know if you take another trip to Tarpon Beach.
TUCKER: Tarpon Springs. I'll keep you posted. (Tucker leaves.)
ARCHER: I want those weapons back online, too.
REED: I'll see what I can do.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in. (T'Pol enters.) ARCHER: It's like we're in
the belly of the beast.
T'POL: We have no reason to believe their motives are hostile.
ARCHER: They're holding my ship hostage.
T'POL: We don't know that.
ARCHER: We don't? Look out there. Do you see any stars? Our engines are
offline, our weapons. Seems kind of hostile to me.
T'POL: I suppose it depends on how you look at it.
ARCHER: Is there something you wanted to see me about?
T'POL: Ensign Sato is trying to communicate with the life forms.
ARCHER: And?
T'POL: Nothing yet. I've spoken to a number of officers. They say the
crew is concerned, but remaining calm.
ARCHER: I've got to get them out of here.
 [Engineering]
 (A blue wisp enters Tucker, and a yellow one leaves.)
ROSTOV: I tried re-initialising the plasma flow, but the power grid
isn't charging. Commander? Are you all right, sir? Can I get you
something?
TUCKER: I'm fine. Goodbye, sir. (Tucker leaves through a small hatch that
another crewman just came out of.)
ROSTOV: Rostov to Captain Archer.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
ROSTOV: I'm sorry to bother you, sir, but I think there might be
something wrong with Commander Tucker.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: What do you mean, wrong?
 [Engineering]
 ROSTOV: He was confused, and seemed to think I was
his superior officer.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: I'll be right down.
ROSTOV [OC]: He's not here, sir. He left Engineering.
ARCHER: Did he say where he was going?
 [Engineering]
 ROSTOV: No, sir.
 [Bridge]
 ROSTOV [OC]: I'm afraid not, Captain.
ARCHER: Archer to Commander Tucker. (to T'Pol) Find him.
 [Mess hall]
 (The Tucker thing has a table full of food in
front of it when Archer, T'Pol and Reed enter.)
ARCHER: Commander.
TUCKER: Commander Charles Tucker III.
ARCHER: Hungry?
TUCKER: Yes. It's all very good. Have you ever tried this?
ARCHER: It's called bread. You've never eaten it before?
TUCKER: I've never eaten anything before.
T'POL: Where's Commander Tucker?
TUCKER: I'm here. Charles Tucker III.
ARCHER: Where's the man who used to be Charles Tucker?
TUCKER: He's exploring another realm. My realm. But he'll be back.
ARCHER: I want him back now.
TUCKER: Please trust me. He's experiencing things he never thought he
could.
ARCHER: Where is he?
TUCKER: It's not a question of where. He's no longer corporeal. But he
will be again, I assure you.
REED: When we were outside, we saw a wisp of vapour penetrate him. Did
you have anything to do with that?
TUCKER: Wisp. Interesting word. Wisp. Wisp. Yes, I suppose you could
call us that. Wisp.
ARCHER: Where do you come from?
TUCKER: We live in subspace. We travel through it. We're explorers,
like you.
ARCHER: Why did you take Commander Tucker?
TUCKER: It's been a long time since we've encountered corporeal beings.
After we performed the first crossing with your commander, we realised
we were compatible. You're very interesting. Trapped in bodies that
need maintenance. You have gender. You require mates to reproduce. You
eat food. We were like you once, but we evolved. Now we can learn how
our ancestors lived.
ARCHER: I want my crewman, and I want my ship released.
REED: Captain. (Through the porthole, we see the ship is moving.)
TUCKER: Your crewman will be returned. You claim to be an explorer,
Captain. Open your mind to new possibilities.
(Enterprise is released into space.)
ARCHER: What about Tucker?
TUCKER: I've enjoyed my time with you.
REED: Sir.
(A yellow wisp enters the Mess hall, then Tucker, and a blue one
leaves.)
TUCKER: Wow.
ARCHER: Wow what?
TUCKER: I was riding right alongside Hopalong Cassidy chasing some bad
guys. Then I was with Lisa again, except this time we were snow sailing
in New Zealand. Then I was eight years old, maybe nine, picking up
leaves with my dad. But it wasn't a dream, Captain. It was as real as
I'm sitting here. They told me you can try it. Anyone on the crew.
ARCHER: Who told you?
TUCKER: They did. The ones I was with.
ARCHER: I thought you were with Hopalong Cassidy and your girlfriend.
TUCKER: I was, but it's hard to explain. You should try it. You'll
understand what I'm talking about. You all should try it.
ARCHER: Take him to Sickbay.
TUCKER: Captain, I'm fine.
ARCHER: We'll let the Doctor decide how fine you are.
REED: Commander. (Reed and Tucker leave.)
ARCHER: Something smells funny.
T'POL: They've released the ship and Commander Tucker. They've done
everything you've asked. Have you considered they may have been telling
the truth when they said they were just curious about us?
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Now that
the Doctor's given Trip a clean bill of health, my primary concern is
to get Enterprise out of here. But Trip tells me it'll be awhile before
he can get the engines online. From what we can tell, these life forms
have no mass. Non-corporeal beings. that's got to be a first for
Starfleet. T'Pol thinks they just want to get to know us. Maybe she's
right. Maybe I don't trust them because they're so different. I'd hate
to think that was the case. (doorbell chime) Computer, pause. Come in.
PHLOX: I hope I'm not disturbing you.
ARCHER: Everything all right?
PHLOX: I'm not certain. One of those beings appeared in Sickbay a few
minutes ago. It entered me right here. (Phlox indicates his forehead.) PHLOX: But my
physiology must not have been compatible. It left almost immediately.
ARCHER: Are you sure you're all right?
PHLOX: I'm fine. But it was disturbing. The lifeform was trying very
hard to reach me.(In the Armoury, Reed spots the reflection of a blue wisp in a
fixture, and makes a dash for it. He tries shooting at it, but of
course that has no effect. It catches him in a corridor, where he has
an appreciative look at a departing woman.)
 [Turbolift]
 CREWWOMAN: I'm going to B deck.
REED: B deck is fine. Are you a female?
CREWWOMAN: Sir?
REED: Your gender. You are a female, correct?
CREWWOMAN: Last time I checked.
REED: I am a male.
CREWWOMAN: I'm aware of that, Lieutenant.
REED: There seem to be a number of anatomical differences.
CREWWOMAN: Sir. (She walks out of the lift, leaving him to select another
destination.)
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 (She is in her casual clothes reading a book when
the doorbell chimes.)
T'POL: Come in.
REED: Sub-Commander.
T'POL: Is there something I can do for you?
REED: You are very beautiful. Are you aware that you are the most
attractive woman on board this ship?
T'POL: Do you think it's appropriate for you to be here at this hour?
REED: Would you mind taking off your clothing? I'd like to learn more
about your anatomy.
T'POL: Have you been drinking?
REED: If we are to engage in mating, it would be easier if you
disrobed.
T'POL: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
T'POL: Would you please come to my quarters with a security team.
ARCHER [OC]: We're on our way.
REED: Are you afraid of me? You shouldn't be.
T'POL: I'm capable of defending myself.
REED: What is it like being a female? Is it much different?
T'POL: I wouldn't know.
REED: If you'd allow the crossing, you'd find out.
T'POL: I don't understand.
REED: If you came to us, you could experience what it's like to be
male. Wouldn't that be helpful to you?
T'POL: I've never thought about it.
REED: You should. We're capable of letting you experience anything you
wish for. It would be a shame not to take advantage of that.
(As he reaches to touch her face, the door opens and T'Pol moves away.)
T'POL: This isn't Lieutenant Reed.
ARCHER: Enough! Humans don't like doing things without their consent.
When are you planning to return Malcolm Reed?
REED: That depends.
ARCHER: Oh, does it? Let's see how much you enjoy experiencing the
human condition locked in Reed's quarters.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Tucker.
ARCHER [OC]: They've got Malcolm. I need the ship
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER: Ready to go on my command.
TUCKER [OC]: They're going to give him back, aren't they?
ARCHER: We'll see.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: What did you do with the, er?
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER: A security detail locked him in Malcolm's
quarters. Get it down, Trip.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Right away, sir. You heard him. (to
Rostov) Let's try to prime the deuterium pumps and fire up the
injectors. Tucker to Ensign Cook.
COOK [OC]: Yes, sir.
TUCKER: I need you and two other engineers down here right away.
COOK [OC]: I'll see who I can find.
ROSTOV [OC]: Commander!
TUCKER: Quickly please. Tucker out. Something wrong? (He goes to where
Rostov is just staring at a control board.) TUCKER: Run into a problem?
ROSTOV: Problem? No, everything's fine.
TUCKER: Did you have any luck priming the pumps?
ROSTOV: I have no idea how to do that. This engine is very complex.
TUCKER: Stay here. I'll be right back. Tucker to the Captain.
 [Turbolift]
 ARCHER: Go ahead, Trip.
TUCKER [OC]: It's Rostov, sir. I think you need to get Malcolm.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: I mean, whoever's running Security, down
here right away.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Hoshi, get a security team to Engineering.
Have them put Crewman Rostov in his quarters.
HOSHI: Aye, sir. Captain, we've been getting reports from all over the
ship. Some of the crew are acting very strange.
ARCHER: Then we're going to need more than one security team. Find out
who's acting strange and have them confined to their quarters.
TRAVIS: How do we know the security officers are okay?
ARCHER: For the moment, we're going to have to hope they are. (to
T'Pol) Start working on a way to figure out who's themselves and who's
not. Maybe Phlox can help you.
 [Engineering]
 (Tucker is staring at a Tactical Alert display.)
COOK: Commander.
TUCKER: Run into a problem?
COOK: No, sir. Just ready to calibrate the dilithium matrix.
TUCKER: Great. Wait till I give you the signal.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: We polarised the hull plating as soon as we
detected that ship. Obviously it didn't do any good. What's keeping
them from taking all of us?
ARCHER: Archer.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: You've got impulse engines back, Captain.
ARCHER [OC]: Thanks, Trip.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: (to Travis) Hold our position.
HOSHI: I thought you said we needed to get out of here.
ARCHER: They've got Malcolm, and God knows how many others. Until we
find a way to get them back, we're not going anywhere.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: What's the big secret?
T'POL: We thought it best not to discuss this over the comm. We don't
know who's been taken.
ARCHER: What have you got?
PHLOX: It was simpler than I thought. Elevated acetylcholine levels in
the autonomic nervous
ARCHER: Doctor, whatever you've got, we need to put it to work.
PHLOX: The Sub-Commander programmed the medical computer. It's
modifying this hand-scanner as we speak.
ARCHER: Get to work as soon as you're ready.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER [OC]: Tucker to Ensign Mayweather.
TRAVIS: Go ahead, sir.
TUCKER [OC]: I'm a little short-handed, Travis.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Think I could get you to go back to the
starboard nacelle and re-polarise the warp coils?
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: No problem, sir.
TUCKER [OC]: Call me when you get to the catwalk.
TRAVIS: I'm on my way.
 [Mess hall]
 (T'Pol and Phlox are at a table having drinks
while lots of crew are getting meals and socialising.)
T'POL: There are two here.
PHLOX: Ensign Cole and Crewman Rossi.
(T'Pol goes out, and returns with a couple of burly security men.)
 [Catwalk]
 TRAVIS: Mayweather to the Bridge.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
TRAVIS: One of those things just followed me up the starboard strut,
but when I got into the catwalk it didn't come through. There must be
something keeping it from getting in here.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Then you'd better stay where you are.
TRAVIS [OC]: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: Archer to Commander Tucker.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Yes, Captain?
ARCHER [OC]: Is there some kind of shielding
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: In the nacelles that might keep these
aliens from getting in?
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: The catwalk's reinforced with osmium
alloy, but it's hard to say if that would do it.
ARCHER [OC]: Travis thinks it will.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: I need you to stop whatever you're doing
and transfer all command functions
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER [OC]: To the starboard catwalk. We're going
to have to get everybody in there.
TUCKER: I'm on it.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: I want you and T'Pol to get the crew up
there as quickly as you can. Hoshi.
HOSHI: It would be best if they stayed where they were.
ARCHER: What?
HOSHI: We're offering them a great opportunity. They may never get
another chance to experience existence as we do.
ARCHER: Security to the Bridge. You're taking over my crew. Why?
HOSHI: I understand how you may be frightened by all this. Losing your
substance, existing as perceptive energy, but you'll be grateful once
you've made the crossing, I promise you.
ARCHER: We're kind of fond of our substance. We're not very anxious to
give it up.
HOSHI: Those who've preceded you are safe and happy. They'll
understand.
ARCHER: Are you doing this for our benefit or for yours? (Two security
guards arrive.) ARCHER: Escort Ensign Sato to her quarters.
HOSHI: You'll understand.
 [Catwalk]
 (Lights are up and people are settling in like
last time.)
ARCHER: How many?
T'POL: Fifty eight, including us.
ARCHER: And outside?
T'POL: Twenty four locked in their quarters, and Doctor Phlox.
ARCHER: You okay, Travis?
TRAVIS: I'm fine, sir. Thank you.
ARCHER: Trip?
TRAVIS: I saw him down near the Command Compartment.
ARCHER: Thanks.
T'POL: We need to learn more about these life forms.
ARCHER: What we need is to get our people back.
T'POL: It's illogical to believe we can do that without learning more
about the aliens' intentions.
ARCHER: Do you have something in mind?
T'POL: I'd like your permission to leave the catwalk.
ARCHER: You wouldn't have a chance. One of those things would take you
before you got back to the saucer section.
T'POL: Not necessarily. If a lifeform attempts to exchange its
consciousness with mine, I believe I can prevent it.
ARCHER: What makes you think that?
T'POL: No offence, Captain, but the Vulcan mind is far more disciplined
that yours. It can resist temptations, emotions, and I believe,
invasions by these lifeforms.
ARCHER: Even if you're right, what would you accomplish?
T'POL: If an alien attempts this transfer, there may be a brief period
when our minds are conjoined. It's possible I can ascertain their
motives.
ARCHER: It's too dangerous. I won't let you do it.
T'POL: There's no other choice.
ARCHER: And if you're wrong?
T'POL: It's a risk I'm willing to take.
ARCHER: Well, I'm not. They've already taken twenty four people. I'm
not going to give them another one.
T'POL: You told me you trust my judgment. Trust it now, unless you have
another suggestion.
 [Sickbay]
 (The comm. beeps.)
PHLOX: Sickbay.
HOSHI [OC]: There's been an accident.
PHLOX: Hoshi?
HOSHI [OC]: Hoshi Sato's been injured. I don't know how to repair the
damage to her body.
PHLOX: What happened?
HOSHI [OC]: Her leg is fractured. She's in considerable pain. She needs
assistance.
 [Hoshi's quarters]
 (Phlox has brought a phase pistol with him. He
presses the intercom.)
PHLOX: I'm armed. If you're near the door, step away.
HOSHI [OC]: She's on the floor. She can't move.
(He enters, and keeps the pistol pointed at her while he does a scan
from just our of reach.)
PHLOX: There's nothing the matter with you.
(Hoshi jumps him as he's looking at the scanner. They fight and she
gets the pistol, but she's lying on the floor and he has hold of one of
her legs.)
HOSHI: I need to find the rest of your crew. Where are they?
(Phlox gets a hypospray from his bag and injects her. She passes out.)
PHLOX: (to spray) I'm glad I brought you along.
 [Corridor]
 (Phlox's communicator chirps.)
PHLOX: Doctor Phlox.
ARCHER [OC]: Is everything going all right, Doc?
PHLOX: More or less.
ARCHER [OC]: Good. T'Pol and I are going to need your help.
(T'Pol has left the starboard nacelle and is walking along the
corridors when a blue wisp finds her and enters her head.)
PHLOX: Sub-Commander? T'Pol? (She's standing motionless.) PHLOX: Have you
succeeded? (He scans her.) PHLOX: Phlox to Captain Archer.
 [Catwalk]
 ARCHER: Did you find her?
PHLOX [OC]: I'm with her now. She's not acting like the others
 [Corridor]
 PHLOX: But she's certainly not herself.
 [Catwalk]
 ARCHER: Doesn't sound like that's the outcome she
expected.
PHLOX [OC]: Her neural pathways are hyperstimulated.
ARCHER: Damn it. You'd better take her to her quarters.
PHLOX [OC]: Yes, Captain.
 [Corridor]
 PHLOX: Come with me. Everything will be all right.
(He cannot budge her so he gets our the hypospray again.) PHLOX: I'm afraid I
have to insist. I promise you (Then the blue wisp leaves her, she
slumps and he catches her.) PHLOX: T'Pol! What is my name? Sub-Commander!
T'POL: They're lying to us.
PHLOX: My name.
T'POL: We don't have time for this, Phlox. I have to get to the
Captain.
 [Catwalk command area]
 T'POL: Their ship is deteriorating, and they have
no way to repair it. They can't survive in space.
ARCHER: So they are doing this to save themselves.
T'POL: Eighty two of them are. One for every crewman on Enterprise.
TRAVIS: How many of them are there?
T'POL: Hundreds. The rest will try to find another vessel of corporeal
beings. Where's Commander Tucker?
TRAVIS: I'm not sure.
T'POL: Please find him. (Travis leaves.) T'POL: If the Commander can find a way
to shield Enterprise, we can leave the catwalk and go to warp.
ARCHER: And lose a third of the crew?
T'POL: Two thirds will survive.
ARCHER: Unacceptable. We're going to find a way to get them back.
T'POL: That may be difficult.
ARCHER: Can they survive in a host that's dead?
T'POL: It would be no different than being exposed to space. They'd
die.
ARCHER: Archer to Phlox.
PHLOX [OC]: Yes, Captain.
 [Catwalk]
 (Travis is walking along, looking for Tucker. The
crew look rather worried.)
TRAVIS: Are you doing all right?
CREWMAN: We're okay.
CREWMAN 2: How long do you think we'll be in here, Ensign?
TRAVIS: I'm sure the Captain will get us out as soon as he can. Has
anyone seen Commander Tucker?
CREWMAN: No, sir.
CREWMAN 2: Not for a while. I think he was down there.
TRAVIS: Thanks.
 [Locker room]
 (Phlox is getting into a space suit.)
PHLOX: We'll have to purge the carbon dioxide within twenty seconds of
respiratory failure.
 [Catwalk command area]
 ARCHER: That'll give you enough time to
resuscitate them?
PHLOX [OC]: Oh, yes.
 [Locker room]
 PHLOX: It's enough time. Don't forget to close off
the ventilation to the starboard nacelle.
 [Catwalk command area]
 PHLOX [OC]: We wouldn't want the gas to affect you
and the others.
ARCHER: Understood.
TRAVIS: Sorry, Captain, I can't find Commander Tucker.
ARCHER: Has anyone opened either of the ventral hatches?
T'POL: Not since we sealed them.
ARCHER: You must've missed him.
TRAVIS: I'll look again.
 [Atmosphere control]
 (Phlox is reading the numbers on the panels.)
PHLOX: Four, five, six, seven.
ARCHER [OC]: All right. Does it have an ID tag?
PHLOX: Junction four one alpha. Atmospheric
 [Catwalk command area]
 PHLOX [OC]: Recycling manifold.
ARCHER: Good. Do you see the releases on either side?
PHLOX [OC]: Yes. There are four of them. (Tucker is standing watching
through a grid, looking impassive.) PHLOX [OC]:Two blue.
 [Atmosphere control]
 PHLOX: Two silver.
 [Catwalk command area]
 ARCHER: Open them. The silver ones first.
 [Atmosphere control]
 PHLOX: Done.
ARCHER: Now pull the panel off.
PHLOX: What should I do with it?
 [Catwalk command area]
 ARCHER: Whatever you want.
 [Atmosphere control]
 ARCHER [OC]: Lay it down on the floor.
PHLOX: Very well. (He pulls it off to reveal a right angled pipe and a
load of lights.) PHLOX: Right where you said it was, Captain.
 [Catwalk command area]
 ARCHER: Find the control panel.
 [Atmosphere control]
 PHLOX: It's right here. It has six green lights.
 [Catwalk command area]
 ARCHER: Each of them should have a switch next to
it.
PHLOX [OC]: About five centimetres to the left.
ARCHER: Now, before we can release the gas into central ventilation,
you're going to have to reroute the transfer lines to the carbon
dioxide tanks. (Tucker leaves quietly.)
 [Atmosphere control]
 PHLOX: And how do I go about doing that?
 [Catwalk command area]
 T'POL: Those six switches control the feed. You're
going to have to recalibrate them in sequence for CO2.
 [Atmosphere control]
 T'POL [OC]: I'll guide you through it.TRAVIS: Commander, I've been looking all over for
you! Are you all right, sir?
(Tucker is working busily at a wall control panel, then abruptly gets
onto the catwalk and walks briskly away.)
TUCKER: I'm fine.
TRAVIS: The Captain asked me to find you. He needs you in the Command
Compartment. Commander! (Tucker breaks into a run, knocking crewmen aside
then goes to open the hatch.)
TRAVIS: You can't go out there, sir. It's not safe! (He gets pushed away.)
TRAVIS: What are you doing? (Travis gets hit, hard, then Tucker goes down the ladder to
the main body of the ship.)
 [Corridor]
 PHLOX: I've reached the access tube, Captain.
ARCHER [OC]: Good. Now pull off the panel.
PHLOX: (heaves at the bar) It's not coming off.
 [Catwalk command area]
 ARCHER: It'll come off. You just need to use a
little muscle.
 [Corridor]
 PHLOX: I've used every muscle I've got. it won't
budge.
 [Catwalk command area]
 ARCHER: Try using your foot
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER [OC]: For leverage. (It comes away so suddenly he falls against the bulkhead
opposite)
PHLOX: Good suggestion.
ARCHER [OC]: Okay.
 [Catwalk command area]
 ARCHER: Now, the next part's a piece of cake.
TRAVIS: We've got a problem, Captain.
ARCHER: Stand by, Doc. What happened?
TRAVIS: Commander Tucker. He just went out the forward hatch.
ARCHER: What?
TRAVIS: I tried to stop him, sir. He didn't look like himself. I think
one of those things got inside him.
T'POL: If he knows what we're doing.
ARCHER: We're going to have to speed things up, Doc. Trip's been taken.
He left the catwalk a few minutes ago.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER [OC]: If he tries to let his buddies out of
their quarters we don't have any guards down there to stop him.
PHLOX: Tell me what to do.
 [Catwalk command area]
 ARCHER: You'll have to purge the osmotic filters.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER [OC]: The valves are right behind the
control circuit. You're going to have to get two fingers through the
upper holes in the support plate.
 [Catwalk command area]
 ARCHER: Normally, that wouldn't be a problem, but
wearing those gloves
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER [OC]: Could make it difficult.
PHLOX: Back home, I'm known for my fine motor skills. I doubt a pair of
EV gloves
 [Catwalk command area]
 PHLOX [OC]: Will deter me.
T'POL: There are two solenoids behind the openings. When you tap them
simultaneously, the plate should retract.
 [Corridor]
 PHLOX: Did you say there were two?
 [Catwalk command area]
(Archer checks the schematic on the monitor/.)
 ARCHER: About three centimetres apart.
 [Corridor]
 PHLOX: Got it.
ARCHER [OC]: You should be looking at two rotary valves and a lever.
PHLOX: I see them.
ARCHER [OC]: Open both valves all the way, then turn the lever to the
three o'clock position. That should do it.
(Phlox seals his helmet shut.)
T'POL: T'POL: The nine o'clock position will vent the gas when we're
finished.
(As Phlox reaches for the lever, Tucker grabs his arm, throws him away
and starts closing the valves instead. Hitting him with the metal cover
doesn't stop him, but a headbutt from a space helmet does. The CO2 is
released while the possessed engineer tries to move the lever back, and
he passes out.)
PHLOX: Phlox to Captain Archer.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
PHLOX: Mission accomplished.
 [Catwalk command area]
 PHLOX [OC]: I'm monitoring Commander Tucker.
ARCHER: Good job.
(Throughout the ship, possessed crew pass out, yellow wisps return home
and blue ones leave.)
 [Corridor]
 PHLOX: It's left Commander Tucker.
ARCHER [OC]: Vent the gas.
PHLOX: In a moment, Captain. I need to be certain the CO2 levels are
consistent throughout the ship, that all the lifeforms are gone.
 [Catwalk command area]
 ARCHER: Ready, Travis?
TRAVIS: (at the helm) Yes, sir.
 [Corridor]
 PHLOX: It's done.
 [Catwalk command area]
 ARCHER: Full impulse.
T'POL: They're in pursuit. (The big ship opens it's maw again.) T'POL: Stand
by. Now. (Archer fires two torpedoes at it. They detonate within the
cavernous body and the ship falls to pieces.)
 [Corridor]
 TUCKER: What's going on, Doc?
PHLOX: Just breathe deeply. You'll be fine.
TUCKER: I was just at a barbecue.
PHLOX: In through the nose, out through the mouth.
TUCKER: I've never seen so many ribs. (Phlox helps him to his feet.)
PHLOX: Follow me, Commander. We have a lot of
doors to unlock.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Judgment
Judgment
 Original Airdate: 9 Apr, 2003
  [Klingon Hall of Justice]
MAGISTRATE: Bring in the prisoner.
(The audience in the galleries stands and shouts in unison as Archer is
brought to stand in the middle of the room, under a spotlight.)
MAGISTRATE: You stand accused of conspiring against the Klingon Empire.
How do you respond?
ARCHER: I'm not guilty.
MAGISTRATE: When this tribunal convenes tomorrow, you will be given a
chance to prove your innocence. If you cannot, there is only one
punishment.
 [Prison
cell]
 (Archer
is staring at a bone joint on his metal plate, A guard lets Phlox enter.)
GUARD: You have five minutes.
ARCHER: Glad you could drop by.
PHLOX: How are you?
ARCHER: I've been better.
PHLOX: I wasn't sure if I'd find you alive.
ARCHER: They promised me a trial before the execution. (Phlox scans
him.) ARCHER: Something wrong?
PHLOX: Xenopolycythemia can be highly contagious. I'm surprised they
haven't put you in isolation. (The guard slowly backs away and leaves
them alone.) PHLOX: Any residual symptoms? Fever, dizziness?
ARCHER: Just a scratchy throat.
PHLOX: Let's have a look.
ARCHER: When did you get here?
PHLOX: Two days ago, but they refused to let us see you.
ARCHER: Enemies of the state aren't allowed visitors.
PHLOX: T'Pol was finally able to convince them that your condition
necessitated a visit from your doctor.
ARCHER: Very thoughtful of her.
PHLOX: She sends her regards, and she wanted me to assure you that
Starfleet, and the Vulcan High Command are doing everything possible to
get you released.
ARCHER: Are they having any luck?
PHLOX: Not yet, but she and Commander Tucker have begun exploring other
options for regaining your freedom.
ARCHER: When this is over, whatever the outcome, I'm counting on them
to get Enterprise safely out of Klingon territory.
PHLOX: I'll let them know. How are your accommodations?
ARCHER: Not so bad. Can't say I'm a big fan of Klingon cuisine.
PHLOX: It may not appear appetising, but it seems like a good source of
protein. I suggest you eat it. (Kolos enters.)
KOLOS: Is he infectious?
PHLOX: I don't believe so.
KOLOS: Then return to your ship.
PHLOX: I'd like to run some more tests.
KOLOS: You're not here to treat him.
ARCHER: Thanks for the house call, Doc.
PHLOX: I'm sure I'll see you soon. (Phlox leaves with the guard.)
KOLOS: I'm Kolos, your advocate.
ARCHER: Jonathan Archer.
KOLOS: The tribunal's about to begin. (Kolos walks out, and Archer follows him.)
ARCHER: We haven't even discussed what happened.
KOLOS: I'm familiar with the charges.
ARCHER: Well, I'm not familiar with your justice system. What can I
expect out there?
KOLOS: Now that you've been charged, the evidence against you will be
presented.
ARCHER: Do I get a chance to testify?
KOLOS: I will conduct your defence.
ARCHER: How can you do that when you haven't heard what really
happened?
KOLOS: I know what happened. You mustn't speak during the tribunal.
I'll speak for you.
 [Hall
of Justice]
 (The
gallery is chanting and banging their spears on the floor.)
ARCHER: What are they saying?
KOLOS: Enemy.
ARCHER: I hope they're not the jury.
KOLOS: There is no jury.
(another figure enters)
ARCHER: Who's that?
KOLOS: Prosecutor Orak. His success is well known.
ARCHER: What about you? What's your success rate?
KOLOS: I've performed my duty.
(The Magistrate enters and raises sparks with his gavel.)
MAGISTRATE: This tribunal is convened. Strength to the Empire.
Prosecutor Orak, you may proceed.
ORAK: I call Duras, son of Toral. (Duras enters.) ORAK: Captain Duras, tell
the tribunal about your encounter with the accused.
DURAS: I am no longer a captain.
ORAK: Explain.
DURAS: I am a second weapons officer serving on the Ty'Gokor defence
perimeter.
ORAK: The Duras I called to testify is Commander of the battle cruiser
Bortas.
DURAS: I was recently reduced in rank.
ORAK: A distinguished Klingon warrior, stripped of his command. Did the
accused have anything to do with your disgrace?
DURAS: Yes.
ORAK: Go on, Weapons Officer Duras.
DURAS: A group of rebels had fled the Klingon Protectorate at
Raatooras. I was commanded to bring these traitors to justice. We'd
followed their warp trail to a system just outside Klingon territory.
 [Bortas
Bridge]
OFFICER: (a young woman) They're near the fifth planet. Another vessel
is docked with them.
DURAS: Show me. (Enterprise appears on the viewscreen by the ringed
planet) What kind of ship is that?
OFFICER: Unknown, but they've taken the rebels aboard.
DURAS: Armaments.
OFFICER: Torpedo launchers fore and aft. Low-yield particle cannons. We
can defeat them easily.
DURAS: Intercept.
OFFICER: They're signalling us.
DURAS: Viewer. Identify yourself.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: Captain Archer of the battle cruiser
Enterprise.
DURAS: The people aboard your ship are wanted for treason. Surrender
them immediately.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: By whose authority?
DURAS: The Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: I don't know your Chancellor, and I don't give
a damn what he wants. I've formed an alliance with these people, and
I'm going to support their revolt.
DURAS: Give them to me now, or I'll destroy your vessel.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: Fire one shot, and you'll be joining your
ancestors in the afterlife.
 [Hall
of Justice]
 ORAK:
He refused to surrender the rebels.
DURAS: Yes.
ARCHER: I didn't say any of those things. Can't you object?
KOLOS: It's not important.
ORAK: And how did you respond to Archer's defiance?
DURAS: I pitied him. He was about to die in defence of these wretched
traitors.
ARCHER: They weren't traitors.
MAGISTRATE: Advocate, haven't you informed the prisoner of the rules of
this tribunal?
KOLOS: My apologies, Magistrate. Be silent, or you will be removed.
ORAK: Continue.
DURAS: I showed him more patience than he deserved, but obviously he
wanted blood to be spilt.
 [Bortas
Bridge]
 DURAS:
Don't be a fool. Your ship is inferior. You won't survive a battle with
us.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: Death to the Empire.
(Enterprise fires two phaser shots at the Bortas.)
DURAS: Return fire! (torpedoes and disrupters)
OFFICER: They're heading for the ring system.
DURAS: The coward thinks he can hide. Pursue them!
(They go into the rings, and the view is obscured by dust.)
DURAS: Where are they? Answer me!
OFFICER: Debris is interfering with sensors.
DURAS: There. Target their engines! All weapons!
(Enterprise fires a single torpedo, and detonates a huge gas plume
which catches the Bortas in the explosion.)
OFFICER: We've lost sensors. Shields are down!
DURAS: Manual targeting! Fire!
(Enterprise does a strafing run as they exit the rings)
OFFICER: They're leaving orbit.
DURAS: Follow them!
OFFICER: Our engines are down.
 [Hall
of Justice]
 DURAS:
It took us three hours to repair our warp drive.
ORAK: But of course, by that time, they were gone. You're fortunate
your First Officer didn't kill you for such a failure. You're
dismissed. (Duras walks across, slowly.)
ARCHER: You're not going to question him?
KOLOS: He'd say nothing that would help you.
MAGISTRATE: Do you have any further evidence to present?
ORAK: No, Magistrate. Duras' testimony is clear. He was attempting to
carry out his mission to bring enemies of the Empire to justice. But
this aggressor, this human, conspired with them to disgrace a proud
warrior and foment rebellion. There can be no doubt that he is our
enemy as well. Captain Archer claims to be innocent. Innocent of what?
This tribunal has already been far too lenient. We haven't accused his
crew, or his government. He's fortunate we haven't dispatched a fleet
of warships to his homeworld, but we do demand that he be held
responsible for the crimes he has committed. We demand that he receive
the most severe punishment our laws decree!
MAGISTRATE: Do you have a response?
KOLOS: No, Magistrate.
MAGISTRATE: Then I will consider the evidence and deliver my verdict.
ARCHER: I'd like a chance to defend myself.
MAGISTRATE: You have been warned.
ARCHER: He's distorting the truth.
MAGISTRATE: Be silent!
ARCHER: Those people weren't rebels, and I wasn't trying to start a
rebellion. I am not your enemy!
(He gets punished by pain sticks.)
MAGISTRATE: This tribunal is in recess.
 [Prison
cell]
 (Archer
tries a bit of the meat on the bone, but spits it out. Kolos enters.)
ARCHER: What is this?
KOLOS: Targ.
ARCHER: It's a little underdone.
KOLOS: I told you to remain silent. You should have listened to me.
ARCHER: Sorry if I interfered with your legal strategy.
KOLOS: My strategy may yet spare your life. I've spoken with the
Magistrate. He's willing to show you mercy if you co-operate.
ARCHER: How?
KOLOS: Tell him where to find the rebels.
ARCHER: I told you, they're not rebels.
KOLOS: It doesn't matter what you believe. They're subject to the laws
of the Empire. There's nothing you can say that will change that.
ARCHER: I haven't been able to say anything.
KOLOS: Where did you take them? Another ship? A planet? Do you
understand what will happen if you don't tell them?
ARCHER: I've a pretty good idea.
KOLOS: I'm offering you a way to save your life.
ARCHER: Let's say I did co-operate. What would happen to these people?
KOLOS: They would be charged with treason.
ARCHER: And end up in a court like this one? Tell the magistrate I'm
going to pass on his offer.
KOLOS: Only a fool would sacrifice himself for people he barely knows.
ARCHER: I know them well enough. They're good people, and I won't turn
them over. If you'd let me testify, tell my side of the story, it might
become clear why I helped them. But from what I've seen, you're all
perfectly happy to ignore what you don't want to hear.
KOLOS: Don't be so quick to accuse me of sharing their interpretation
of the law.
ARCHER: No? What's your interpretation?
KOLOS: I became an Advocate many years ago. They were different times.
ARCHER: Better or worse?
KOLOS: The courts were more willing to listen.
ARCHER: Then maybe you should remind them of those different times.
Nothing like a good history lesson.
KOLOS: I'm an old man. Too old to challenge the rules.
ARCHER: Even if your client's life depends on it? I get the feeling
you're as frustrated as I am. That you want to stand up to them. But
you've given up. You're afraid of them.
KOLOS: I'm not afraid.
ARCHER: Then prove it. Challenge them. Show them what a real trial is
like.
 [Hall
of Justice]
MAGISTRATE: Strength to the Empire. Have you informed the accused of
our offer?
KOLOS: I have.
MAGISTRATE: And does he wish to address this tribunal?
KOLOS: He does. He wishes to testify in his own defence.
ORAK: I object. The time for testimony is over.
KOLOS: With respect, Magistrate, no verdict has been reached.
ORAK: Irrelevant! I urge you to end these proceedings.
KOLOS: I am within my rights to present further testimony.
ORAK: You're speaking of archaic rights.
KOLOS: Surely I don't need to remind the Magistrate, the judicial
charter of Koloth states an advocate is entitled to challenge the
charges at any point during the tribunal. To my knowledge, that charter
has not been cast aside. From the time of Kahless, our courts have
stood as a forum where justice is dispensed with honour. Now, will my
case be heard, or will it not?
MAGISTRATE: Call your witness.
KOLOS: Identify yourself.
ARCHER: I'm Captain Jonathan Archer of the Earth Starship Enterprise.
ORAK: Do you admit, Captain Archer, that you gave aid and comfort to a
vessel fleeing the Empire?
ARCHER: We answered a distress call. They were starving. Their life
support was failing.
ORAK: Their health isn't at issue here. You helped them to escape!
KOLOS: Will my client be allowed to testify, or not?
MAGISTRATE: Prosecutor, you will show the Advocate the same respect he
has shown you. Continue.
KOLOS: Recount for this tribunal your recollection of the events.
ARCHER: As I said, we had received a distress call.
 [Bridge]
(A sad little ship hangs on the viewscreen in front of a ringed planet.)
 ARCHER:
Magnify. Biosigns?
T'POL: Twenty seven.
ARCHER: Any response?
HOSHI: No, sir.
ARCHER: Malcolm?
REED: Main propulsion's offline, life support is failing. They're in a
bad way, sir.
ARCHER: Can you dock with them?
TRAVIS: Their port engine is venting reactor coolant. I can try to come
in on the starboard side, but it'll be tricky.
ARCHER: Do your best.
 [Sickbay]
 ALIEN:
Our warp drive failed three weeks after we left. We tried to set a
course for the nearest system at impulse, but main power went down.
ARCHER: How long ago was that?
ALIEN: I don't know. Six weeks, maybe more. We diverted auxiliary power
to life support, but it wasn't enough. Food processors failed, water
recyclers.
PHLOX: I've put them all on protein supplements, but two of them are in
serious condition.
ALIEN: When we left there were fifty four aboard.
ARCHER: What brought you out here?
ALIEN: Several years ago, our colony was annexed by a species we had
never seen before. They said they'd provide for us in exchange for our
allegiance, that we'd become a part of their Empire. But they stripped
us of our resources, left us with nothing. We waited for them to
return. They said they'd bring food, fuel. They never came back.
 [Hall
of Justice]
 KOLOS:
You knew they were fleeing the Empire.
ARCHER: We knew that their colony had been abandoned.
KOLOS: And you chose to show them compassion.
ARCHER: They were starving. They wouldn't have lasted another week.
ORAK: They were subjects of the Empire. Their welfare was not your
concern.
ARCHER: Apparently it wasn't yours, either.
ORAK: You see the contempt these humans have for us. He still believes
he did nothing wrong.
KOLOS: And Prosecutor Orak has yet to prove that he has.
ORAK: He aided these rebels, and now he refuses to help us bring them
to justice!
MAGISTRATE: I will hear what the accused has to say.
KOLOS: Continue.
ARCHER: My Chief Engineer had determined that their vessel was beyond
repair.
 [Ready
room]
 ARCHER:
Some of the crew will have to double up, but I think we can accommodate
all of them.
T'POL: I've already given the order. Considering the alternative was to
set the ship adrift, I anticipated your decision. Where do you plan to
take them?
ARCHER: They were headed for a system a few light years from here. That
should keep them safe from the Klingons.
T'POL: Empires tend to expand. They may eventually discover they
haven't travelled far enough.
REED [OC]: Captain, please report to the Bridge.
 [Bridge]
 (A
Klingon ship is on the viewscreen.)
ARCHER: Looks like they didn't abandon the colonists after all.
REED: Perhaps they're bringing the supplies they promised.
T'POL: It's a D5 battle cruiser. I doubt it's bringing supplies.
ARCHER: How long before they get here?
REED: Seventeen minutes.
ARCHER: Are all the refugees aboard?
REED: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: Cut their ship loose and go to tactical alert.
 [Hall
of Justice]
 ORAK:
So, you were preparing for battle.
ARCHER: I was preparing to defend my ship.
KOLOS: As any good Klingon Commander would be.
ORAK: The accused has already admitted that he knew the rebels were
subjects of the Empire.
ARCHER: They may have been subjects of the Empire, but it sure as hell
looked like you had abandoned them.
ORAK: And he knew the Bortas was coming to retrieve them, yet he
launched a deliberate attack against an Imperial vessel. This human is
guilty of more than inciting rebellion, he has committed an act of war!
 [Situation
room]
 REED: I
don't suppose there's any chance of outrunning them.
T'POL: Their maximum speed is warp six.
TRAVIS: If we could disable their engines.
REED: Sustained fire from our phase-cannons should be able to penetrate
their armour, but I doubt they'd sit still long enough to give us the
chance.
ARCHER: What's the composition of those rings? (T'Pol checks on the main table display.)
T'POL: Nothing unusual. Methane
ice, isolytic plasma. Diamagnetic dust.
ARCHER: When we pulled that Klingon ship out of the gas giant, did you
get a look at their sensor array?
REED: Pretty standard multi-spectral sensors, not too different from
ours.
ARCHER: If we could ignite the plasma in those rings, would it disrupt
their sensors?
REED: For a few seconds.
ARCHER: A few seconds will have to do. Can you modify a torpedo?
REED: I believe so.
ARCHER: How long?
REED: How long do I have?
T'POL: The Klingon ship will be here in less than eleven minutes.
ARCHER: Get moving.
 [Hall
of Justice]
 ORAK:
So, you've laid a trap for the Bortas.
ARCHER: We had no intention of firing first.
ORAK: Such a noble human.
KOLOS: I was assured the accused would be allowed to speak without
interruption.
ORAK: By all means. I find his version of events extremely
entertaining.
ARCHER: The Bortas had dropped out of warp with their weapons charged.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS:
They're on intercept course. Two hundred thousand kilometres and
closing.
(Reed enters and nods)
ARCHER: Hail them.
DURAS [on viewscreen]: Identify yourself.
ARCHER: I'm Jonathan Archer, captain of the Starship Enterprise.
DURAS [on viewscreen]: You're harbouring fugitives. Surrender them.
ARCHER: I wasn't aware they'd committed any crime.
DURAS [on viewscreen]: They're wanted for inciting rebellion.
ARCHER: From what I can tell, they are in no condition to incite
anything. Apparently their colony was abandoned by
DURAS [on viewscreen]: Turn over the rebels, now!
ARCHER: What do you intend to do with them?
DURAS [on viewscreen]: That's none of your concern.
ARCHER: I'm sorry, but I'm not prepared to hand them over without a
little more information. If I could speak to someone in your
government.
DURAS [on viewscreen]: I speak for the Empire.
ARCHER: Fair enough. Let's sit down and try to (Duras ends the transmission,
then a torpedo hits Enterprise, followed by another, and disrupter
fire. They return phase cannon fire.)
REED: Hull plating's at eighty percent. No damage to the Klingon ship.
ARCHER: Head into the rings.
T'POL: They're pursuing. Ten thousand metres. (A bang and a shower of
sparks on the Bridge.) T'POL: We're approaching a large fragment, six hundred
metres in diameter, bearing two two seven mark four.
ARCHER: Put us behind it.
REED: They're closing, sir. Four thousand metres.
ARCHER: Stand by.
REED: Three thousand metres. Two thousand. Eight hundred metres.
ARCHER: Fire! (the modified torpedo curves around the big rock and
detonates the pocket of gas)
REED: Our sensors are down.
ARCHER: Let's hope theirs are, too. Get us out of here.
 [Hall
of Justice]
 KOLOS:
You say the Bortas fired first.
ARCHER: Yes.
KOLOS: And you tried to reach an accommodation with Captain Duras?
ARCHER: He refused.
ORAK: Duras was under no obligation to accommodate this human.
KOLOS: So you were simply defending your ship when you attacked the
Bortas?
ARCHER: Yes.
KOLOS: And then what happened?
ARCHER: We left the system and took the refugees with us.
KOLOS: You could have destroyed the Bortas. Why didn't you?
ARCHER: Because Captain Duras is not my enemy.
KOLOS: Not your enemy. I submit to this tribunal that Captain Archer is
guilty. Guilty of meddling in Klingon affairs on more than one
occasion. In fact, I've discovered his name is well known to the High
Council. The accused once stood before the Chancellor himself and
exposed a Suliban plot that would have thrown the Empire into civil
war.
ORAK: That is absurd.
KOLOS: The facts are on record. Perhaps the Prosecutor has grown
complacent with his research. The records of the Imperial Fleet also
mention this man. His ship was instrumental in the rescue of the
Klingon Raptor, the Somraw, from the dense atmosphere of a gas giant.
ORAK: Even if this is true, it has nothing to do with this case.
KOLOS: It has everything to do with this case. It shows a pattern in
Archer's behaviour that was repeated in his encounter with Captain
Duras. Yes, he may be self-righteous, but his meddling has saved a
Klingon ship and perhaps the fate of the Empire itself. If Captain
Archer is guilty, he is guilty of nothing more than being a nuisance,
and hardly worth the attention of this tribunal. And if he must be
punished, let the punishment fit that crime.
 [Detention
cell]
 ARCHER:
How long should it take for a verdict?
KOLOS: It usually doesn't take long at all. I must have been more
persuasive than I thought.
ARCHER: Thanks for what you've done for me.
KOLOS: Don't thank me yet. The odds are still very much against us.
(He gets a small flask out and offers it to Archer.)
ARCHER: What is it?
KOLOS: Bloodwine. It should help make the wait more pleasant. (Archer takes a mouthful.)
ARCHER: What's it the blood of?
KOLOS: Don't feel badly if you can't stomach it.
ARCHER: I didn't say that. (He has some more.) ARCHER: How many cases have you won?
KOLOS: Oh, I'm not sure. Over two hundred. But that was a long time
ago, when the tribunal was a forum for the truth and not a tool for the
warrior class.
ARCHER: There are other classes?
KOLOS: You didn't believe all Klingons were soldiers?
ARCHER: I guess I did.
KOLOS: My father was a teacher. My mother, a biologist at the
university. They encouraged me to take up the law. Now all young people
want to do is take up weapons as soon as they can hold them. They're
told there's honour in victory, any victory. What honour is there in a
victory over a weaker opponent? Had Duras destroyed that ship he would
have been lauded as a hero of the Empire for murdering helpless
refugees. We were a great society not so long ago, when honour was
earned through integrity and acts of true courage, not senseless
bloodshed.
ARCHER: For thousands of years, my people had similar problems. We
fought three world wars that almost destroyed us. Whole generations
were nearly wiped out.
KOLOS: What changed?
ARCHER: A few courageous people began to realise they could make a
difference.
 [Hall
of Justice]
MAGISTRATE: I have weighed the evidence carefully. Advocate Kolos has
made an impressive case, much to the surprise of this tribunal. Based
upon his arguments I am inclined to believe that the accused was a
victim of his own foolishness. He was not fomenting rebellion. But, as
Prosecutor Orak has made clear, the laws of the Empire have been
violated and Captain Archer must be held accountable for his actions
regardless of his intent. I therefore find the accused guilty as
charged. (popular acclamation from the galleries) However! However this
tribunal cannot ignore his actions assisting the Klingon people.
Therefore the sentence of death is commuted. Silence! Jonathan Archer,
you are condemned to the dilithium mines on the penal colony of Rura
Pente for the remainder of your life. Remove the prisoner.
ORAK: I protest.
MAGISTRATE: I wouldn't protest too loudly, Prosecutor. You've won your
case.
ORAK: And I compliment the magistrate on his just ruling. But the
sentence for these crimes must be death.
KOLOS: The sentence is death. You condemn this man to Rura Pente. What
is the life expectancy of a prisoner there? Six months, a year at the
most? And you expect us to believe that this is an act of mercy.
MAGISTRATE: This court has shown you a great deal of patience,
Advocate. Don't test my limits any further.
KOLOS: I ask for no special treatment. Only that my client be judged
fairly, as any Klingon would be judged. But it has been many years
since anyone stood in this chamber and received justice.
MAGISTRATE: Watch your words. You insult the honour of this tribunal.
KOLOS: Honour? You acknowledged that Captain Archer acted with
conviction and integrity, and how do you reward him? With this grand
public display of compassion before sending him to his death in a
frozen cave.
MAGISTRATE: Enough!
KOLOS: Forgive me if I fail to see the honour in that.
MAGISTRATE: You are in contempt of this tribunal. Since you have such
admiration for the prisoner, you will join him on Rura Pente for a
period of one year. Remove them both.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
The Vulcan High Command will continue to lobby for the Captain's
release.
TUCKER: So what do we do?
T'POL: The Klingons have only allowed us to remain here during the
trial. We're to leave immediately.
REED: And abandon the Captain?
T'POL: We don't have a choice.
TRAVIS: What's this Rura Pente like?
T'POL: It's quite inhospitable.
REED: They're going to have to get there.
T'POL: We're deep inside Klingon territory. A rescue attempt is out of
the question.
TUCKER: I'm willing to risk it.
T'POL: The Captain isn't. He made it clear he didn't want us to
endanger the crew on his behalf.
TUCKER: So you're saying we just forget about him?
T'POL: I'm saying a rescue isn't an option, but there are diplomatic
channels.
TUCKER: We tried diplomatic channels.
T'POL: Not all of them. I've dealt with several Klingon bureaucrats in
the past. Some of them can be persuaded. Mister Mayweather, take us out
of orbit.
 [Rura
Pente]
 (Down
inside the ice and snow covered planet, prisoners wearing ragged furs
against the cold mine dilithium by hand.)
GUARD: You! Get back to work!
(Kolos and Archer are hacking at the walls with pickaxes, and Kolos is
exhausted.)
ARCHER: You all right?
KOLOS: Perhaps I spent too much time in the law library and not enough
in the battlefield.
ARCHER: Not all Klingons are warriors. Remember? (A guard prods Kolos with a pain stick.)
GUARD: Our ships run on dilithium,
not talk.
ARCHER: Leave him alone.
GUARD: Get back to work.
(They fight and Archer turns the pain stick on the guard, and gets
jabbed himself by a second guard.)
GUARD: Anymore trouble from you and you'll spend the night on the
surface.
KOLOS: You're a fool.
ARCHER: You're welcome.
KOLOS: Haven't you learned your lesson? This is why you were sent here
in the first place. For interfering in affairs that have nothing to do
with you.
ARCHER: We have a saying on Earth. You don't kick a man when he's down.
KOLOS: So, are all humans like this?
ARCHER: Like what? Fair?
KOLOS: Stupid.
ARCHER: (laughing) It's in our nature.
KOLOS: Stand up. We have work to do, unless you want to sleep on the
surface.
(Later, as the pair dump some rock into a cart.)
GUARD [OC]: Follow me. This way.
ARCHER: New arrivals?
KOLOS: Prosecutor Orak has been busy.
(They return to work, but one of the newcomers leaves the group and
approaches Archer. Kolos intercepts him.)
KOLOS: Stay away from us. We have nothing you want.
REED: (throwing back hood) Captain.
ARCHER: It's all right. He's from my ship.
REED: It's good to see you, sir.
ARCHER: You, too. Lieutenant Reed, this is Kolos, my Advocate.
REED: Pleasure.
ARCHER: How'd you get here?
REED: T'Pol knows a few Klingon officials from her days in the Ministry
of Security. One of them put us in touch with a corrections officer who
was willing to look the other way for the right price. I came on one of
the dilithium barges. We bribed the captain to bring us here and take
us back to Enterprise.
ARCHER: Is there room for one more?
REED: I imagine so, but we have to hurry.
ARCHER: Come on.
KOLOS: I can't go with you.
ARCHER: Why not?
KOLOS: I've been an advocate for fifty years, and I spent the last
twenty of them standing in that tribunal playing my part, holding my
tongue, and all the while honourable men were being sent to places like
this without the benefit of a defence. And then I was assigned your
case. You told me that on your world a few courageous people made a
difference. I'm not sure I have the courage, but I know I'll never be
able to restore honour to my people living as a fugitive.
ARCHER: You realise what that means. You said most prisoners here don't
survive a year.
KOLOS: Most prisoners here have very little to live for.
REED: Captain?
KOLOS: Go. Go!
ARCHER: Thank you.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Horizon
Horizon
 Mission date: Jan 10, 2153
Original Airdate: 16 Apr, 2003
  {Enterprise's 'sweet spot']
 (Travis
is relaxing and reading a book in zero gravity.)
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Mayweather.
TRAVIS: Mayweather.
HOSHI [OC] The captain wants you to report to the Bridge. Admiral
Forrest called a few minutes ago. We're reversing course.
TRAVIS: I'm on my way.
 [Situation
room]
 T'POL:
The planet's orbit has shifted, taking it between two gas giants. Their
gravitational pull is causing its core to superheat.
ARCHER: Starfleet thinks it will be covered with erupting volcanoes by
the end of the week.
TRAVIS: This system's almost thirty light years behind us.
ARCHER: Admiral Forrest assures me it's only a temporary detour.
TUCKER: Some geologic fireworks. Could be fun.
ARCHER: Set a course.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
 [Ready
room]
 ARCHER:
Come in.
TRAVIS: Do you have a minute, sir?
ARCHER: Several, actually. Please. What's on your mind?
TRAVIS: I was wondering if I could make a personal request.
ARCHER: Of course.
TRAVIS: My family's ship, the Horizon, we're going to be passing close
to it. I wouldn't mind going by for a visit. It's about ten hours off
our flight path. Enterprise can still get to the planet with time to
spare. You could pick me up on the way back.
ARCHER: I think we can manage without you for a few days.
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir.
ARCHER: Your folks'll be surprised to see you.
TRAVIS: My father's been ill for a few months.
ARCHER: Nothing serious, I hope.
TRAVIS: My mother said he'll be fine. She's the ship's medic.
ARCHER: I thought you told me your mother was the chief engineer.
(Both sit.)
TRAVIS: She's both.
ARCHER: I guess they have to wear a lot of hats to keep those old ships
running.
TRAVIS: My grandfather held the record. Five jobs at one time, two of
them on the bridge.
ARCHER: There was a time when I gave serious thought to serving on a
cargo ship.
TRAVIS: You, sir?
ARCHER: It was a few years before Starfleet was chartered.
TRAVIS: Why didn't you sign up?
ARCHER: Long story. I'll tell you the next time we have breakfast.
After we dock, I'll have Phlox go over with you, have him take a look
at your father.
TRAVIS: I'd appreciate that, sir.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER:
You'll be glad to hear the thermal scanners are up and running.
T'POL: And the imaging relays?
TUCKER: Yep. We'll drop six of them in high orbit. That should give us
a bird's-eye view of every volcano on the planet. You know, there's not
going to be a lot to do once we get there. Sensors will record
everything automatically.
T'POL: You should have plenty of time to practice your harmonica.
TUCKER: I've talked Chef into doing something special. Starting
Tuesday, it's going to be movie night every night. Thought you might be
interested, seeing how you enjoyed that western. We're going to be
showing the three greatest horror movies ever made. Frankenstein, Bride
of Frankenstein and Son of Frankenstein. We might even throw in Abbott
and Costello Meet Frankenstein.
T'POL: I have no interest in horror movies.
TUCKER: How do you know if you've never seen one? You don't have to see
all of them. Just come the first night. I promise you'll like it.
Reanimated life forms, science run amok, they're right up your alley.
 [Mess
hall]
 REED:
Four years isn't so long. My last family reunion was almost a decade
ago.
TRAVIS: Starfleet really ought to think about putting families on
starships.
REED: You must be joking.
TRAVIS: No one would ever get homesick.
REED: Yes. Well, they'd better post a psychologist onboard because I'd
need one if my parents were roaming the corridors.
TRAVIS: On a cargo ship, you can't walk ten metres without running into
your baby-sitter or a great-aunt.
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Ensign Mayweather.
TRAVIS: (gets communicator out of pocket) Go ahead.
HOSHI [OC]: We've gotten a response from the Horizon. It's your mother.
TRAVIS: Thanks, Hoshi. Put it through to my quarters.
Captain's personal log, January 10, 2153. We're on course for our
rendezvous with the Horizon. Unfortunately, I've just received word
that Ensign Mayweather's family is facing an unexpected tragedy.
 [Enterprise's
'sweet spot']
 ARCHER:
Mind if I join you?
TRAVIS: Of course not.
ARCHER: I haven't been up here since we launched. Come here a lot?
TRAVIS: Every now and then.
ARCHER: Commander Tucker told me what happened. I'm sorry.
TRAVIS: My mother sent a message to Starfleet six weeks ago, but I
never got it.
ARCHER: The civilian channels can be pretty slow.
TRAVIS: I should have called him. We were in comm. range a few months
ago. I guess I wasn't ready to talk to him yet. He wasn't very happy
with me when I joined Starfleet. He'd been grooming me for his job
since I was kid.
ARCHER: I'm sure it wasn't easy for him when you left, but I know for a
fact that he was proud of you.
TRAVIS: With all respect, sir, I'm not so sure he was.
ARCHER: Did he ever tell you about the letter he sent me? It was almost
two and a half years ago. There were a few candidates I was looking at
for helm officer. I was having a little trouble deciding, so I
contacted their former COs hoping for a more personal evaluation.
TRAVIS: What did he say?
ARCHER: He wrote the shortest recommendation. Just one sentence. He
said he'd never met a more natural stick and rudder man in his life and
I'd be a fool if I didn't choose you. When I saw how you handled
yourself at the helm, I knew he was right.
TRAVIS: I wish he would have told me that.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX:
As I suspected, it's nothing more than a simple headache.
T'POL: I was hoping for something more serious.
PHLOX: Oh?
T'POL: I've been coerced into watching tonight's movie.
(Phlox gives her a hypospray.)
 PHLOX:
If you're looking for a medical excuse, I'm afraid you're out of luck.
If it's any consolation, I'll be there as well. I agree this form of
entertainment is rather crude, but it can often provide an enlightening
glimpse into human behaviour.
T'POL: Don't be surprised if you see me here again afterwards. I have
little doubt my headache will return.
 [Corridor]
(Enterprise has rendezvoused with the Horizon.)
TUCKER: Just a quick tour of the engine room. That's all I'm asking.
TRAVIS: The Horizon's fifty years old. I'm sure you've seen far more
impressive warp reactors.
TUCKER: Zephram Cochrane designed that engine himself. I've heard
rumours that he personally signed the inside of each reactor casing.
Oh, almost forgot.
(They reach the airlock, and Trip hands over a PADD.)
TRAVIS: What's this?
TUCKER: A few family photos. I downloaded every picture I've taken
since we left Spacedock. Thought your mom might like to see what her
boy's been up to.
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir.
TUCKER: You bet.
 [Horizon
corridor]
 TRAVIS:
I wouldn't call it a dangerous mission. We've gotten into a few
skirmishes, but nothing we couldn't handle.
RIANNA: I got a letter from your sister. She said you mentioned a close
call with some kind of storm.
TRAVIS: We ran into a small wavefront a few months ago. The crew had to
squeeze into one of the nacelles for a couple of days. She probably
made it sound worse than it was.
RIANNA: She also mentioned something about alien soldiers forcing their
way aboard.
TRAVIS: It was really just a misunderstanding. They thought Enterprise
had been abandoned. Captain Archer convinced them to leave.
RIANNA: I guess there's no point in asking you about the Romulan
minefield.
TRAVIS: How'd you know about that?
RIANNA: I've been serving on cargo ships for a long time. I've made a
few contacts here and there.
VOICE [OC]: Stand by to go to warp.
(They brace them selves for the jolt and judders.)
TRAVIS: Charlie must be at the helm.
RIANNA: What makes you say that?
TRAVIS: His warp jumps were always a little rough. Where are we headed?
RIANNA: Deneva station. Just a quick run to pick up supplies. We'll
have you back in plenty of time.
MAN: (doing some welding) Watch your step, ma'am. Travis?
TRAVIS: Hey!
(They embrace.)
MAN: Haven't seen you for a while. Did you lock yourself in a cargo
container again?
TRAVIS: Do you always have to bring that up?
MAN: It's good to see you. If you're not busy tonight, stop by the
Mess.
TRAVIS: I will.
(They carry on further down the corridor then Travis turns left.)
RIANNA: Did you forget your way?
TRAVIS: Guest quarters are over here.
RIANNA: You're not assigned to guest quarters.
 [Room
B6]
 TRAVIS:
I thought my room had been reassigned.
RIANNA: It was, but they didn't mind giving it up for a few days. We
don't get VIPs very often. I found some of your old things. Thought you
might feel more at home.
TRAVIS: I can't believe you kept this. (a paper starchart up on the
wall)
RIANNA: You stayed up all night for a month, mapping every system you
planned to visit when you grew up.
TRAVIS: I've still got a ways to go.
RIANNA: I'm glad you're home.
TRAVIS: Me, too. (they hug) We're going to get through this, Mom.
RIANNA: Those plasma injectors aren't going to align themselves. I
should go. After you've settled in, come by the Engine room. Some
people want to say hello.
 [Cargo
module]
 PAUL:
Transfer these canisters over to Module Four.
TRAVIS: Are you sure you're old enough to drive that thing?
PAUL: An ensign ought to salute before addressing a captain.
TRAVIS: Acting captain. Don't let it go to your head.
PAUL: (to crewman) I'll catch up with you in a few minutes.
(The brothers hug.)
TRAVIS: The jacket looks good on you.
PAUL: Thanks. Didn't think I'd be wearing it this soon.
TRAVIS: Business must be good. I've never seen this module so full.
PAUL: The biggest problem these days is keeping track of everything.
Dad kept a lot of the inventory in his head. I'm trying to reconstruct
the database. We still can't find the stromatopod larvae we're supposed
to be delivering to the Demerians. I only hope they didn't end up in
cold storage.
TRAVIS: If you need me to help out with anything.
PAUL: Thanks, but we can handle it. You're on leave. I'm not going to
put you to work.
TRAVIS: See you at dinner?
(Paul nods, and Travis goes to leave.)
PAUL: Travis. You might want to change into something a little less
conspicuous.
 [Bridge]
(There's a red-headed woman with a pony-tail at the helm.)
T'POL: I've deployed the imaging relays.
ARCHER: How long until the show begins?
T'POL: Approximately thirty hours. The holometric camera still need to
be calibrated.
TUCKER: I can help with that.
ARCHER: Get started. I'd like to share our pictures with Starfleet,
give Admiral Forrest a front-row seat.
HOSHI: Echo Three's within range. It shouldn't be too hard to set up a
downlink.
 [Situation
room]
 TUCKER:
So, you coming tonight?
T'POL: If the sensors are calibrated by then.
TUCKER: Well, you'd better make up your mind. Seats are going to fill
up fast.
T'POL: According to the database, Frankenstein is also a work of
literature.
TUCKER: Mary Shelley wrote it, the wife of a famous poet.
T'POL: Perhaps a dramatic reading would be more illuminating.
TUCKER: You expect a Mess hall full of crewmen to sit still while
someone reads to them?
T'POL: They'd be more likely to appreciate the author's true intent.
TUCKER: You want to start a book club, go right ahead. You're going to
be there tonight, aren't you, sir?
ARCHER: Wouldn't miss it.
TUCKER: I'll save you some popcorn. (leaves)
ARCHER: Might be a good idea for you to go, too. It might be fun, and a
little fraternising couldn't hurt.
T'POL: I don't understand how sitting silently in a darkened room
constitutes fraternising.
ARCHER: It's a communal experience. Tell you what, let's make a night
of it. Dinner in the Captain's Mess eighteen hundred, movie at nineteen
thirty. You'll be my date.
T'POL: I beg your pardon?
ARCHER: I'll be a perfect gentleman. And if you don't like the movie,
I'll never ask you to sit through another one.
 [Horizon
Bridge]
 TRAVIS:
All right, try it now. (helmsman nods) I've increased the range of the
navigation sensors. The helm will make course corrections a lot
quicker.
PAUL: What's wrong?
TRAVIS: I'm just working on a few upgrades.
PAUL: I don't remember asking for any upgrades.
TRAVIS: You were busy. I didn't want to bother you. You're going to
love this. You know those port stabilisers that were always acting up?
Before I left, I spoke with Commander Tucker.
PAUL: Commander Tucker.
TRAVIS: Our Chief Engineer, on Enterprise. He showed me how to
reconfigure the spatial discriminators. Shouldn't give you any more
trouble.
PAUL: What's going to happen if these improvements of yours go offline?
You'll be back on your Starfleet ship, out of comm. range. Who's going
to fix it? I'd prefer it if you didn't modify any more systems without
discussing it with me.
TRAVIS: Whatever you say, sir.
PAUL: Maybe you can stop by Engineering, build us a warp five engine.
 [Room
B6]
(Travis
is lying on the bed, looking at his childhood starchart.) 
TRAVIS: Come in.
NORA: (blonde woman with pony-tail) I heard we had a visitor.
TRAVIS: Word travels fast.
(They embrace.)
NORA: I still can't believe he's gone. I'm so sorry, Travis.
TRAVIS: Thanks.
(She sees one of his old toys.)
NORA:  Aren't you a little old for this?
TRAVIS: I don't know. I thought it might be fun to regress for a while.
What do you say we turn off the grav-plating and jump on the bed?
NORA: And get grounded again? That wouldn't look too good on your
Starfleet record. How's Enterprise?
TRAVIS: Keeps us busy. We've gone a hundred and fifty light years, seen
twenty two inhabited worlds.
NORA: In eighteen months?
TRAVIS: You can't believe what's out there.
NORA: Columbus, Magellan, Travis Mayweather. How long are you home for?
TRAVIS: Just a few days.
NORA: Any chance of getting an extended leave?
TRAVIS: I'm afraid not. I doubt Magellan got much time off, either.
What's wrong?
NORA: I don't mean to spoil your visit, but things haven't exactly been
running like clockwork since your father died.
TRAVIS: What do you mean?
NORA: We missed a rendezvous with an Orion freighter two weeks ago. The
Cargo Authority wasn't too pleased. We're also low on deuterium. We've
had to dip into the reserves twice this month. Morale's been better,
Travis. Horizon's lost its captain, and some of the crew are starting
to wonder if Paul's ready for the job. You might have noticed he's been
a little on edge.
TRAVIS: He's always on edge.
NORA: More than usual.
TRAVIS: My mother hasn't mentioned any of this.
NORA: I guess she didn't want to worry you.
TRAVIS: He's only been in command a few weeks. Give him a chance. He'll
grow into it.
NORA: I hope you're right. I'm sure this is the last thing you wanted
to hear right now, but I thought you should know.
TRAVIS: Thanks.
(The ship judders.)
TRAVIS: Charlie at the helm?
NORA: Just a little spatial turbulence. You've gotten spoiled on
Enterprise.
(A harder judder, then another.)
TRAVIS: That's no turbulence.
(They are being shot at by two ships.)
 [Horizon
Bridge]
 JUAN:
Hull fracture in Module three. We're venting atmosphere.
PAUL: Seal it off. Try hailing them again.
(Travis enters.)
JUAN: They're still not responding.
TRAVIS: What's going on?
PAUL: We're under attack.
TRAVIS: By who?
PAUL: I don't know.
JUAN: Should I arm the plasma turrets?
PAUL: No. Transfer reserve power to the hull plating. We need to get
out of their weapons range. Go to maximum warp.
TRAVIS: You're hauling thirty thousand metric tons. You're not going to
be able to outrun them.
PAUL: You heard me.
JUAN: Yes, sir. Warp one point six, one point seven, warp one point
eight
(The old tub is shaking a lot.)
TRAVIS: They're still closing.
PAUL: A little more.
JUAN: One point eight five.
(The ships fire three more shots at the Horizon, then something that
lands on the hull and starts blinking.)
JUAN: They're moving off.
PAUL: Reduce speed to one point five.
(The shaking stops.)
TRAVIS: They attached something to the hull.
PAUL: Show me.
(The viewscreen shows the thing with it's flashing red light.)
JUAN: It's emitting a subspace signal. Could be some kind of beacon.
PAUL: Call Engineering. Tell them to get someone out there to pry it
off.
TRAVIS: I wouldn't recommend that. This is a dicobalt signature, a
high-yield explosive. If anyone gets too close, it might decide to go
off.
(Senior staff gather at the back of the small Bridge to see a display
on a monitor.)
JUAN: The Constellation sent us this. This ship attacked them eight
weeks ago and it planted a beacon on their hull. A day later, this
cruiser showed up and demanded their cargo. The Constellation tried to
drive them off, but the aliens got aboard and killed three of their
crew. Then they took the entire shipment.
TRAVIS: What kind of weapons does the Constellation have?
JUAN: Two plasma turrets, same as us.
PAUL: There has to be a way to remove that beacon.
RIANNA: I wouldn't risk it. If it detonates, you could lose the
nacelle.
PAUL: If we jettison a few tons of that ore, can we increase to warp
two?
RIANNA: I don't see why not.
PAUL: That should allow us to reach Deneva Station ahead of schedule.
It's well-armed, we should be safe there.
TRAVIS: What happens if they come back before we arrive?
PAUL: There's no other choice. We can't shoot our way out of this.
(Travis studies the schematic on the monitor.)
 TRAVIS:
I've seen this kind of engine configuration before. It's not that
different from a Mazarite ship.
RIANNA: Mazarite?
TRAVIS: We had some trouble with them. We managed to knock out their
engines with our phase cannons.
PAUL: We don't have phase cannons.
TRAVIS: I can tie the plasma turrets directly into the impulse engines.
Lieutenant Reed did that and it increased our yield by eighty percent.
PAUL: I'm not going to risk all of our lives by getting into a fight we
can't win. If they reach us before we make it to Deneva, we'll give
them what they want.
TRAVIS: If there's one thing I've learned from Captain Archer, it's
that you don't give in to people like this. You're only going to
encourage more attacks, not just against you, but other cargo ships.
PAUL: I appreciate the advice, but this isn't your problem. You're not
part of this crew anymore. Jettison that ore and increase our speed.
RIANNA: (to Travis) Even your father had to make compromises. The
safest thing to do is give them what they want. Cargo can be replaced.
 [Mess
hall]
 (The
1931 classic version of Frankenstein is showing, and we're up to the
reanimation scene.)
DOCTOR F: [on screen]: Fool. If this storm develops as I hope, you'll
have plenty to be afraid of before the night's over. Go on, fix the
electrodes. This storm will be magnificent. All the electrical secrets
of heaven. This time we're ready, eh, Fritz? Ready.
(Phlox is attentive and eating popcorn, but T'Pol is reading a PADD
instead.)
ARCHER: What are you doing?
T'POL: I'm reviewing this morning's sensor data.
ARCHER: I thought you were going to give this a chance.
DOCTOR F [on screen]: Just a few stitches. And look, here's the final
touch. A brain you stole, Fritz. Think of it, the brain of a dead man.
PHLOX: This Doctor Frankenstein, his technique is not dissimilar to a
practice on B'Saari Two. They successfully used an isolytic current to
reanimate the bodies of the recently deceased.
TUCKER: Really.
PHLOX: Of course, the revived individuals weren't capable of more than
basic cellular metabolism. However, the B'Saari have developed a
procedure that shows promise in repairing the synaptic
T'POL: (turning around) We can stop the film if it's disturbing your
conversation.
DOCTOR F [on screen]: In fifteen minutes, the storm should be at its
height.
(Archer offers T'Pol some popcorn, and she accepts it.)
DOCTOR F [on screen]: Then we'll be ready. What's that noise?
 [Horizon
Bridge]
 JUAN:
Captain? Looks like someone's rerouting the impulse relays.
PAUL: Where?
JUAN: Module five.
PAUL: You have the Bridge.
 [Module
five]
 (Travis
is working at a wall panel when Paul storms in.)
PAUL: I thought I made myself clear.
TRAVIS: If those aliens come back, you'll thank me.
PAUL: I told you, I'm not going to take this ship into battle.
TRAVIS: You may not have a choice.
PAUL: I didn't ask for your opinion, and I didn't approve your
modifications. Stop what you're doing.
TRAVIS: Paul.
PAUL: You heard me.
TRAVIS: I didn't mean to undermine your authority.
PAUL: Really.
TRAVIS: But you're being unreasonable. I just want us to be prepared.
PAUL: Us? You keep talking as if you're a part of this crew.
TRAVIS: It's still my home.
PAUL: You turned your back on us a long time ago.
TRAVIS: Is that what this is about? Me leaving? If you want to be an
effective captain, you've got to set your personal feelings aside,
listen to what other people have to say.
PAUL: More words of wisdom from Starfleet?
TRAVIS: No, your father. He said that to me a long time ago. If he was
here now, he'd tell you the same thing.
PAUL: You quoting Dad? You never listened to him. If you had, you
wouldn't have abandoned your family. You barely spoke to him for the
last four years. You weren't even here when he died.
TRAVIS: That isn't fair.
PAUL: You knew he was sick, but you didn't really care. You only
decided to stop by because it was convenient for you. Hostile aliens
aren't our problem, it's Starfleet and people like you. Do you have any
idea how hard it is to find new crewmen? No one wants to run freight
anymore. They all want to be explorers cruising around on state of the
art ships with their personal chefs.
TRAVIS: You want to stand around feeling sorry for yourself, go ahead.
I've got better things to do.
PAUL: Take those upgrades offline. I'll confine you to quarters if I
have to.
TRAVIS: I'm just trying to help you, Paul. In case you haven't noticed,
you could use a little help right now.
PAUL: I don't want your help.
TRAVIS: You want to take them offline? Do it yourself. 
 [Horizon
mess]
 RIANNA:
I understand you made a few modifications to the impulse relays. Next
time, you might want to check with me. I am the Chief Engineer.
TRAVIS: I knew how Paul would react. I didn't want to drag you into it.
RIANNA: I've played referee between you and your brother for a long
time.
TRAVIS: (picking at his food) Never thought I'd actually miss these.
RIANNA: Nutri-paks?
TRAVIS: Not just any Nutri-pak, strawberry shortcake. The first time I
tasted real shortcake was in San Francisco. It just wasn't the same.
RIANNA: I think they've ruined your taste buds.
TRAVIS: I wouldn't mind eating like this again. I'm thinking about
asking for an extended leave. I'm sure Captain Archer would approve,
considering.
RIANNA: How long would you stay?
TRAVIS: As long as I'm needed.
RIANNA: But you're needed on your ship.
TRAVIS: I'm not the only helm officer.
RIANNA: Even if your captain agrees, it could be a long time before
Enterprise is back this way again.
TRAVIS: There's a lot for me to do here. I can help upgrade the
guidance and warp systems. With a little luck, we could make Horizon
the fastest J-class in the fleet.
RIANNA: You're going to give up your career, move back home and take
orders from your brother?
TRAVIS: My career's the last thing on my mind right now.
RIANNA: Congratulations. Now you know what it's like to be a parent. I
could spend every waking minute worrying about you two, but I'd never
get any work done.
TRAVIS: He's not ready, Mum.
RIANNA: You should've seen your father when he took over. He was a year
younger than Paul is now. He was an engineer. He didn't know the first
thing about running a Bridge. We fell so far behind schedule, he almost
lost his ECA license. He wanted to quit. I wouldn't let him. Your
brother just needs some time.
TRAVIS: You don't think I should stay.
RIANNA: Didn't we have this conversation? It was right here in this
room, four years ago, when you first thought about joining Starfleet.
TRAVIS: A lot has changed in four years, Mum.
RIANNA: That's true, and a lot more's going to change. Will we be
talking about this again in another four years? You're the helmsman of
the first warp five starship. I'm proud of you. Everyone here is. Even
Paul, though he won't admit it. If you'll indulge a little motherly
advice, don't let your guilt over leaving guide your decision.
TRAVIS: I'll try to keep that in mind. Good night.
(He kisses her.)
RIANNA: Night.
 [Captain's
mess]
 TUCKER:
I find it hard to believe that no one on Vulcan's ever heard of a
horror movie.
T'POL: There is something similar. a discipline known as tarul-etek. It
uses disturbing imagery to provoke an emotional response.
ARCHER: They try and scare you to see how well you suppress your
emotions.
T'POL: I don't understand why humans would feel compelled to frighten
themselves.
ARCHER: Gets the heart pumping.
T'POL: Cardiovascular activity would be more efficient.
ARCHER: You never did give us your opinion of the movie.
T'POL: There were many medical inaccuracies.
TUCKER: What did you think of the story?
T'POL: I thought the protagonist was interesting.
TUCKER: Doctor Frankenstein.
T'POL: No, his creation. From my perspective, this was the story of an
individual persecuted by humans because he was different.
TUCKER: That's one way of looking at it.
T'POL: In many ways, the film seemed quite prophetic. The reaction of
the villagers, for example. It was similar to the reception Vulcans
received after landing on Earth.
ARCHER: I don't recall anyone greeting a Vulcan ambassador with torches
and pitchforks.
T'POL: Nevertheless, many humans reacted with fear and anger.
ARCHER: They didn't know what to expect.
T'POL: I'm going to recommend that Ambassador Soval watch the film.
TUCKER: You're kidding.
T'POL: I believe it would help Vulcans who've recently arrived on
Earth.
ARCHER: Maybe inviting her to movie night wasn't such a great idea.
T'POL: On the contrary. I'm looking forward to Bride of Frankenstein.
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
HOSHI [OC]: You might want to look out the window, sir.
(Volcanoes are erupting very violently.)
 [Bridge]
 (The
ship shakes briefly.)
REED: Thermal shear. Some of those eruptions are getting close to
Enterprise.
ARCHER: Take us up another five thousand kilometres.
HELM: Aye, sir.
T'POL: Captain. I'm reading biosigns on the planet. To quote Doctor
Frankenstein, it's alive.
ARCHER: I thought it was uninhabited.
T'POL: It appears that several microbial species which live underground
are being unearthed by the volcanic activity.
ARCHER: See what you can learn about them.
 [Horizon
Bridge]
 (The
expected cruiser has arrived.)
PAUL: Full power to the hull plating.
JUAN: We're being hailed.
PAUL: This is Captain Mayweather of the ECS Horizon.
ALIEN [on viewscreen]: (grey skin, slightly beaky mouth) Prepare to
surrender your vessel and evacuate the crew.
PAUL: I'll give you our cargo, but not our ship.
ALIEN [on viewscreen]: You won't be harmed if you co-operate. Drop out
of warp.
PAUL: We're dozens of light years from our homeworld. There has to be
some compromise we can
(The alien ends the transmission.)
TRAVIS: They're charging weapons.
PAUL: Bring the weapon upgrades online. Still think you can disable
their engines?
TRAVIS: If I can get a clear shot, but I can't do that as long as
they're behind us.
JUAN: They've hit Module five.
TRAVIS: It's going to be tough to manoeuvre with thirty kilotons of
cargo. We've got to cut it loose.
RIANNA: Engineering, stand by to release the primary clamps.
PAUL: You do remember how to fly this ship.
TRAVIS: I'm sure it'll come back to me.
(He takes over from Juan.)
PAUL: Take us out of warp. Release the clamps.
TRAVIS: They're closing. Forty metres, thirty.
RIANNA: Just a few more clamps.
TRAVIS: Ten metres.
(The cargo tug flies free of the modules, with the cruiser in pursuit
and firing.)
RIANNA: Starboard plating's down.
PAUL: Travis.
(He loops the loop to come up behind the cruiser and do a strafing run,
but they also get a hit.)
RIANNA: Hull plating's gone.
TRAVIS: I'm coming around again.
(More carefully placed shots and the cruiser grinds to a halt.)
JUAN: Their weapons are going down.
PAUL: Keep our turrets locked on them. Open a channel. This is Captain
Mayweather. I'd think twice before attacking any of our ships again.
Re-dock with the cargo section, then get us out of here.
TRAVIS: Aye, Captain.
 [Room
B6]
 (Travis
is back in Starfleet uniform and packing to leave.)
TRAVIS: Come in.
PAUL: All packed?
TRAVIS: Wouldn't want to wear out my welcome.
PAUL: I got a message from Enterprise. They're running ahead of
schedule. We'll be docking in about twenty minutes.
TRAVIS: If you like, I'll speak with Lieutenant Reed. I'm sure he can
help you remove that alien beacon.
PAUL: Thanks. So, did you ever make it to Trelkis Three?
TRAVIS: What?
PAUL: Trelkis Three, the planet with the multi-centric rings. You used
to talk about it when we were growing up.
TRAVIS: We haven't travelled quite that far.
PAUL: When you do, how about sending me a subspace postcard.
TRAVIS: You can count on it. (they shake hands)
PAUL: Well, I'd better get back to the Bridge. See you in another four
years?
TRAVIS: Maybe sooner.
PAUL: I'd like that.
 [Airlock]
 ARCHER:
Welcome back.
(He shakes Travis' hand)
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir.
(they walk along the corridor)
ARCHER: How's your family?
TRAVIS: They're okay.
ARCHER: We spotted some damage on their port cargo modules.
TRAVIS: Probably an old meteorite impact.
ARCHER: You sure everything's all right?
TRAVIS: Never better, sir.

Breach
 Original Airdate: 23 Apr, 2003
  [Sickbay]
 (Phlox
is going around putting various foodstuffs into various cages and
containers)
HOSHI: Feeding time?
PHLOX: When isn't it? (He takes a bundle of fluff out of a box.)
HOSHI: What is that?
PHLOX: It won't bite. It's called a tribble. (She takes it.) PHLOX: It was
extremely difficult to acquire. They're outlawed on most worlds.
HOSHI: Why? Is it dangerous?
PHLOX: Oh, far from it. All it's capable of doing, really, is eating
and breeding. The problem is they breed quite prodigiously. (Phlox takes it
from her and drops it into another cage, where, amid much screeching,
trembling of foliage and rattling of the bars, we assume it gets eaten.)
PHLOX: The only thing that keeps their population in check is the abundance of
reptiles on their homeworld. Are you feeling all right, Ensign?
HOSHI: I just came by to give you this transmission. It's from the
Denobulan Science Academy. Marked urgent.
PHLOX: Thank you.
 [Situation
room]
 TRAVIS:
These caverns go on for fifty kilometres.
PHLOX: They've mapped fifty kilometres. No one knows exactly how far
they extend.
TUCKER: What were these scientists of yours doing down there?
PHLOX: This cave system is known for its mineral formations. The
speleothems are supposed to be particularly unusual.
ARCHER: They've been underground for six months. The Denobulan Science
Academy lost contact with them three weeks ago. The planet's called
Xantoras. The government's been politically unstable for several years.
In the last few weeks a militant faction has taken control.
PHLOX: They're demanding that all off-worlders leave. Anyone who fails
to comply could face imprisonment, or possibly worse.
REED: Then why don't the Denobulans evacuate their own scientists?
ARCHER: They can't get here in time. Enterprise is less than a day
away. We've been asked to pick them up. First we have to find them.
You've had some caving experience.
TRAVIS: There are some pretty steep inclines here, but I think I can
handle it.
ARCHER: What about you and Malcolm?
TUCKER: Don't worry, Captain. I'm sure Travis is an excellent teacher.
ARCHER: Get some gear together.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir. (Tucker, Reed and Travis leave.)
PHLOX: I realise this was an unusual request, Captain. I want to thank
you.
ARCHER: Happy to help, Doctor.
 [Launch
bay]
 TRAVIS:
Pitons.
TUCKER: All here.
TRAVIS: Ration packs.
TUCKER: A week's worth.
TRAVIS: Flex-cable?
REED: Five hundred metres.
TRAVIS: Waste disposal units.
TUCKER: What are these for?
TRAVIS: We take out everything we bring in. (Archer enters.)ARCHER: I just spoke to the Xantoras Regional Governor. He's
issued a general order. You have to get them out of there in three
days.
TUCKER: That's not much time.
ARCHER: The military's preparing search patrols to arrest any stray
off-worlders when the deadline arrives. If you haven't found them in a
day and a half, I want you to turn around and head back.
TUCKER: No arguments here.(The
shuttlepod heads down to the planet as every other ship is heading away
from it.)
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
What's the problem?
T'POL: One of the transports leaving the planet just declared an
emergency.
HOSHI: Their reactor casings ruptured. The Captain's asking the
Xantoras for permission to go back down.
ARCHER: Can you put it on speaker?
ALIEN [OC]: Several compartments have flooded with radiation. I have
injured passengers and crew.
XANTORAS [OC]: Your request has been denied. Leave orbit immediately.
ALIEN [OC]: Our situation is critical!
XANTORAS [OC]: We're tracking your vessel. If you attempt to land, we
will commence
ARCHER: Where are they?
T'POL: In a low orbit. six hundred kilometres below us.
ARCHER: Set a course. Open a channel. I want to speak to their Captain.
 [Sickbay]
(Enterprise is docked with the alien ship, and assorted alien patients
are being treated.)
PHLOX: There could be internal bleeding. Run a haemostatic scan. (to
another nursing assistant) Treat these with dermalin gel and give him
two cc's of anaprovaline for the pain. You're going to be fine. (A crewman is accompanying another stretcher.)
CREWMAN: He was working near the
reactor when it ruptured. (Phlox stares at the injured man.) CREWMAN: Doctor?
PHLOX: Get him into the Imaging Chamber.
 [Planet
- entrance to cave system]
 TUCKER:
What have you got?
REED: (with scanner) Nothing but three humans, one of which is not
entirely convinced we're going in the right direction.
TUCKER: Make that two.
TRAVIS: This is the nearest entrance to their campsite. I'd be willing
to bet they came this way.
 [Cave
system]
 (Nice,
tall tunnels to walk along, with the occasional stalagmite.)
TRAVIS: Watch your footing. There's a lot of loose rock.
TUCKER: The last cave I was in had handrails, a gift shop, a snack bar.
REED: There's an opening. Over here.
(further on they come to a sheer drop)
REED: Still willing to bet they came this way?
TRAVIS: Yes, sir.
TUCKER: Isn't there a beginners' cliff we can start on?
TRAVIS: Don't worry, I'll go first.
(They secure their ropes with pitons, then Travis abseils down.)
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER:
How's it going?
PHLOX: These two are doing well. His injuries were more extensive. His
body absorbed a heavy dose of radiation. I've stabilised him for now,
but he's going to need intra-cellular regeneration. (It's the one Phlox
stared at.)
ARCHER: What are his chances?
PHLOX: It's a complex procedure, but I'd say the odds are in his
favour.
HUDAK: (waking) here am I?
ARCHER: You're on my ship, Enterprise. I'm Captain Archer.
HUDAK: What happened?
ARCHER: There was an accident on your transport.
HUDAK: (sees Phlox for the first time) What's he doing here?
ARCHER: He's our doctor.
HUDAK: Keep him away from me.
ARCHER: You need his help.
HUDAK: I'd rather die than be treated by him.
 [Corridor]
(Outside Sickbay, Phlox tries to explain.)
PHLOX: Our two species have a complicated history. We've gone to war
with the Antarans on several occasions.
ARCHER: Recently?
PHLOX: On the contrary. It's been three hundred years since our last
conflict.
ARCHER: And there's still bad blood between you?
PHLOX: They've been particularly bitter disputes.
ARCHER: If you explain to him that he won't survive without your help,
maybe he'd set the past aside for a few hours.
PHLOX: I seriously doubt it. He insisted I leave the room. I don't
think you realise how much bad blood there is.
ARCHER: You could always sedate him and perform the treatment.
PHLOX: I have to respect his wishes.
ARCHER: Even if he wishes to die?
PHLOX: The will of the patient is the cornerstone of Denobulan medical
ethics.
ARCHER: Don't you believe if you can help someone your ethically bound
to do so?
PHLOX: Hippocrates wasn't Denobulan.
ARCHER: This is an Earth ship, Doctor. I won't let that man die in my
Sickbay if it can be prevented.
PHLOX: Without his consent, there is nothing I can do.
ARCHER: I'm giving you an order.
PHLOX: I'm sorry, Captain, but I'm afraid I can't follow it.
 [Caves]
 (The
trio are abseiling down a cliff. Again?)
TRAVIS: Watch your footing, sir.
TUCKER: Thanks.
(But rock comes away when his feet hit it, and he ends up swinging
free.)
REED: Travis!
TRAVIS: Stay calm. Commander, are you all right?
TUCKER: Just testing the rope. (He gets his feet back against the cliff. They reach a handy ledge.)
TRAVIS: Why don't you take a break. I'll see what's below.
(Travis heads off, and there's still a long way down to go. Reed spots something in a hole in the rock)
REED: Hey, what's that? (Tucker dusts off a metal box.)
TUCKER: I think it's Denobulan. I've seen
characters like these in Phlox's medical books.
REED: You don't suppose Denobulans carry out everything they bring in?
TUCKER: (opens it) Rock samples.
REED: Looks like we're on the right track.
(They prepare to follow Travis.)
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER:
How are you feeling?
HUDAK: I'd like to return to my ship.
ARCHER: Your ship was damaged by the reactor leak. It'll be a few days
before you can go back aboard. You were exposed to high levels of
radiation. You need treatment.
HUDAK: I prefer to be treated by another physician.
ARCHER: If you don't let Phlox operate, you won't survive more than two
days. I understand there's a troubled history between your peoples, but
I can assure you Phlox is an excellent doctor.
HUDAK: Our history is much more than troubled. Did your doctor tell you
that their battle tactics resulted in twenty million Antaran
casualties?
ARCHER: He wasn't that specific.
HUDAK: I imagine not. They've been very successful at putting it behind
them.
ARCHER: Do you want to become a casualty of a war that ended three
hundred years ago? Phlox has been my Chief Medical Officer for nearly
two years. I've never questioned his skill or his integrity.
HUDAK: It's quite possible he's a proficient surgeon, but I don't
intend to find out.
ARCHER: You'd rather die?
HUDAK: I'm the first Antaran to even see a Denobulan in six
generations.
ARCHER: If you spent some time with him, it might change your
perception of them.
HUDAK: A few hours in our historical archives might change yours.
ARCHER: I prefer to make my judgments based on firsthand experience. I
respect your history and the sacrifice your people made, but I can tell
you that the Denobulans you're describing are not the people I've met.
Don't sacrifice your life based on preconceptions.
 [Phlox's
office]
 ARCHER:
Why haven't you ever mentioned this?
PHLOX It wasn't our proudest moment, but we've done our best to put it
behind us.
ARCHER: Do you know you're the first Denobulan he's ever met?
PHLOX: And he is the first Antaran I've ever met.
ARCHER: Doesn't that seem odd to you? That in three hundred years
neither side has tried to reconcile. Maybe you put it behind you too
quickly.
PHLOX: As I said before, the situation is complicated. From childhood,
every Antaran is taught that Denobulans are enemies to be feared,
reviled.
ARCHER: This is your chance to prove them wrong.
PHLOX: I doubt I could.
ARCHER: Set aside your preconceptions. I made some headway with him,
but I won't be the one holding the scalpel. Show him that he can trust
you.
PHLOX: Do you believe I can earn his trust in less than thirty six
hours?
ARCHER: All I'm asking is that you try. Your ethics might keep you from
treating him against his will, but nothing's stopping you from talking
to him. You're a doctor. He's your patient. Find a way to help him.
 [Caves]
(Luckily, the rock climbers had just enough cable to reach the next
layer of tunnels. Reed starts scanning.)
TUCKER: Toss a coin?
REED: They went that way.
TUCKER: How can you tell?
REED: Well, look at those. (He shines his light on some pretty crystals.)
REED: If I was a geologist, that's the way I'd go.
TRAVIS: Stay close to the wall.
(They're traversing a narrow ledge.)
REED: I don't have much choice. It's getting steeper.
TRAVIS: Let me lock off. Check the safety, Commander.
(He starts to put another piton in a crack in the wall, but Reed slips
and takes Tucker with him, them Travis as the piton fails. They toboggan
down the incline on their bottoms until finally Travis jams one foot
against the wall and halts the train. Tucker and Reed are dangling in
mid-air over yet another bottomless-looking pit. Tucker is trying to get to the cliff wall.)
TUCKER: I can't reach it. (He carries on swinging
while Travis grimaces in pain.) TUCKER: Almost!
TRAVIS: I can't hold this much longer.
TUCKER: Stand by. We'll try again. Let's swing together. You ready? On
three. One, two, three!
TRAVIS: The rope's slipping!
Tthe two ropes leave his hands just as Tucker gets a piton into a crack
which then holds both him and Reed.)
TUCKER: We're all right!(The pair make it back up to Travis on the
ledge, and check out his ankle.)
TRAVIS: Is it broken?
TUCKER: Yes. You tore a couple of ligaments, too.
TRAVIS: We need to keep moving. Just give me something for the pain.
(Tucker gives him a hypo.)
TUCKER: Sorry, Travis. You're not going anywhere.
TRAVIS: I can make it, sir.
REED: We're already behind schedule, Ensign. We can't have you slowing
us down. Thanks for getting us this far.
TUCKER: You'll be all right.
TRAVIS: Respectfully, sir, it's not me that I'm worried about.
TUCKER: Give me some light on this. (He starts to set Travis's ankle.)
 [Sickbay]
 HUDAK:
What are you doing?
PHLOX: Checking your biosigns. Nothing else.
HUDAK: Very diligent. What a dedicated healer you must be.
PHLOX: You're a long way from home. What brought you here?
HUDAK: Practicing your bedside manner?
PHLOX: I enjoy a good challenge. You haven't answered my question.
HUDAK: I'm a teacher of xenomythology. I study the legends of alien
species.
PHLOX: Well, I imagine the diverse population on this planet made it
ideal for your research. Enterprise is here to pick up three Denobulan
scientists. They also found this world uniquely suited to their
fieldwork.
HUDAK: How delightful that we have so much in common. Why do you want
to save my life?
PHLOX: I'm a doctor.
HUDAK: Do you believe that saving one Antaran will assuage your guilt
for killing millions?
PHLOX: I haven't killed anyone.
HUDAK: Now you finally have your chance.
PHLOX: I assure you, the regeneration procedure is quite safe. If
you'll allow me to proceed
HUDAK: You must know a great deal about our anatomy after what your
doctors did to us. (Phlox walks quickly away.) HUDAK: Tell me, were you raised
listening to stories about my people? The evil Antarans. Did they give
you nightmares?
PHLOX: I could ask you the same question about my people.
HUDAK: Do you have children, Doctor?
PHLOX: Why?
HUDAK: Did you tell those stories to them? Did you teach them to hate
Antarans just like you were taught?
PHLOX: My children have nothing to do with this.
HUDAK: Don't they? If they were here right now, what would they think
about their father talking to an Antaran?
PHLOX: Enough!
HUDAK: Would you even let them in the same room with me?
PHLOX: I have tried to treat you with respect, but I refuse to listen
to these insults. You're the reason we haven't been able to put the
past behind us. You have kept this hatred alive. No Denobulan would
want to be in the same room with you! (Phlox storms out of Sickbay.)
 [Mess
hall]
 (It is
empty save for Phlox toying with his food, when T'Pol enters and gets
herself a drink.)
T'POL: May I join you?
PHLOX: Actually, I'm not in the mood for company, Sub-Commander. Wait.
I'm sorry. Sit down.
T'POL: If you wish to be alone.
PHLOX: Sit. Please. Please. How are the repairs to transport coming?
T'POL: Slowly. The damage was extensive. How is your patient?
PHLOX: Dying, but that seems to be his wish.
T'POL: That's unfortunate.
PHLOX: I've had patients refuse treatment before, but usually in the
final stages of an illness. But this man seems determined to die just
to prove a point. It's painful to admit, but I understand why. When I
was quite young, I wanted to take a trip to an arboreal planet near our
system. It was a park of sorts with a great variety of exotic animal
life. Some friends and I had planned the journey for months, but the
week before I was supposed to leave one of my grandmothers took me
aside and told me I couldn't go.
T'POL: Why not?
PHLOX: She said the planet was tainted. Antarans had lived there once.
Even though they'd been gone for years, she believed the place had been
spoiled by their presence.
T'POL: Did you go?
PHLOX: No, but when I had children of my own I took them there. I was
determined not to raise them as I was raised.
T'POL: Your children are fortunate to have a father who taught them to
embrace other cultures.
PHLOX: I certainly tried. (He looks near to tears.)
T'POL: Are you all right?
PHLOX: Thanks for your company. Good night.
 [Caves]
 (Tucker
and Reed are crawling through narrow passages, hauling their backpacks
separately.)
TUCKER: Can you see anything?
REED: More of the same.
TUCKER: Are you sure this is the way they came?
REED: I didn't see any other passage.
TUCKER: We'll give it another half hour, then we're turning back.
(Reed's scanner beeps)
REED: Three biosigns. Denobulan.
TUCKER: How far?
REED: About fifty metres.
(They come out into a proper big cavern with artificial lights set up
and scientific equipment.)
YOLEN: (grey hair in a ponytail) Who are you?
TUCKER: Commander Tucker of the Starship Enterprise. This is Lieutenant
Reed.
YOLEN: I hope you won't think I'm rude but there are many other caverns
here to explore.
TUCKER: We're not geologists.
REED: The Denobulan Science Academy asked us to find you.
YOLEN: Why?
TUCKER: The Xantoras. They've given all the off-worlders three days to
leave and that was two days ago.
ZEPHT: (black hair) Then you'd better hurry.
TUCKER: You don't understand. We've been ordered to take you out of
here. We've got a lot of hard climbing ahead of us, so you'd better
decide how much of this gear you can do without.
YOLEN: We're sorry you came all this way, but we're not leaving.
TUCKER: Were not leaving without you.
YOLEN: You've warned us about the situation, Commander. You've
accomplished your mission.
REED: Not quite. Your Science Academy will hold us responsible if we
come back alone.
TREVIX: (a woman) If the Academy knew the progress we were making,
they'd never have sent you.
TUCKER: You don't get it. When the Xantoras get their hands on you,
they'll throw you in prison. They may even execute you.
YOLEN: All the more reason for us to stay down here where we're safe.
REED: You can't stay here forever.
ZEPHT: I doubt we'll need to. The government changes hands so often,
everything will probably be cleared up by the time we're finished.
TUCKER: I realise your work is important, but you can't risk your lives
for these rocks.
YOLEN: Rocks? This is the most remarkable collection of speleothems
we've ever seen. There's calcite, aragonite, botyroidal flowstone. I've
spent fourteen years searching for tractosites this perfect. These
samples can provide clues to prevent seismic disasters on Denobula.
TUCKER: How much longer do you need?
TREVIX: Two weeks, maybe three.
TUCKER: Three weeks? I've spent the last two days falling down cliffs
and getting stuck in lava tubes all just to find you. Now, I've got an
injured man waiting for us and we have just enough time to get out of
here before we end up in front of a Xantoras firing squad. My orders
are to bring you back, and I promise you that's what I'm going to do.
YOLEN: You can't force us to leave.
TUCKER: Want to bet? We didn't risk our lives to hear you say, thanks,
but no thanks. So pack up whatever you need because I swear, I'll tie
you up and drag you out by your ankles if that's how you want it.
YOLEN: We have a lot of samples. We'll need your help.
TUCKER: Fine.
 [Sickbay]
 
 HUDAK:
I'd prefer to spend my last few days alone.
PHLOX: That's your decision, but if my knowledge of Antaran lifespans
is correct, your last days won't come for about sixty years.
HUDAK: What are you talking about?
PHLOX: Once the intra-cellular regeneration is complete, you should be
able to
HUDAK: I refused your treatment.
PHLOX: I need to take you off the pain medication before I begin the
procedure.
HUDAK: Get away from me. I was told your principles prevented you from
treating me against my will. Or don't your ethics apply to Antarans?
PHLOX: I did have nightmares.
HUDAK: What?
PHLOX: You asked me if I had heard stories as a child about the
Antarans. My grandmother lived through the last war. I would lay in my
bed at night thinking about her stories, terrified that one of those
evil Antarans would climb through my window.
HUDAK: I hope your confession makes you feel better, Doctor, but it
doesn't change a thing.
PHLOX: You also asked me if I have children. I have five. And no, I
never told them my grandmother's stories. When they asked me about the
Antarans, I told them the truth, as best as I knew it. I told them
about our military campaigns against your people. About how we had
demonised you, turned you into a faceless enemy. I wanted them to learn
to judge people for what they really are, not what the propaganda tells
them.
HUDAK: How would you know who we really are?
PHLOX: I don't. But I'm proud to say that my children would consider my
grandmother's attitude archaic. All of them but one. We have grown more
open-minded since the last war, but there are still Denobulans who fear
Antarans, even hate them. My youngest son, Mettus, was seduced by those
people. I did my best to convince him he was mistaken. I told him I
wouldn't tolerate the values he was embracing. It created a rift
between us. Maybe I didn't do enough to reach him. Last time we spoke
was nearly ten years ago. You wanted to know what my children would
think if they were here now. I can tell you what Mettus would think. He
would be happy to have me grant your request and let you die. But that
is not the example I tried to set for my children. Why not live and set
an example for yours?
 [Caves]
 (The
Denobulans and their Starfleet rescuers are crawling through that
narrow passage again, when )
TUCKER: What's wrong?
YOLEN: Nothing. (Yolen moves some rocks concealing another case like the one
found earlier.)
TUCKER: Then keep moving.
REED: (further back) What's the problem?
TUCKER: I don't know. Come on. Let's go.
YOLEN: I just need a moment.
TUCKER: We don't have a moment. What are you doing up there? Are those
rock samples? We can't carry any more.
YOLEN: It took us six weeks to extract these from the rock bed.
TUCKER: If you don't start moving in the next five seconds, I'm going
to take my phase pistol and shoot you in the ass.
YOLEN: These are priceless.
TUCKER: One, two. (There's a tremor.) TUCKER: Go!
(Travis tries to hide in a corner of his ledge as rocks fall down the
cliff. The group reach the bottom of the big climb.)
TUCKER: Could be some kind of seismic activity.
REED: Feels like weapons fire to me. Pretty high yield by the sound of
it.
TUCKER: We still got two hours until the deadline. (to the geologists)
You better get your climbing gear on.
YOLEN: We don't have any climbing gear.
REED: You mean to tell us that you climbed down that rock face without
any ropes, any safety equipment at all?
ZEPHT: Exactly.
TUCKER: Well, in that case, after you.
(Another tremor/explosion brings a boulder bouncing down the rock face. )
TUCKER: Get against the wall! (It lands behind them.) TUCKER: Everyone all
right?
REED: I'm fine.
TREVIX: Yes.
TUCKER: Let's keep moving before we get trapped down here.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI:
Captain.
ARCHER: Is that the Governor?
HOSHI: He says his time is precious.
ARCHER: So is mine.
GOVERNOR [OC]: Captain Archer, I thought I made myself clear.
ARCHER: You did, which makes me wonder why you're attacking my people.
GOVERNOR [OC]: What do you mean?
ARCHER: One of your patrols has opened fire in the vicinity of the
caves. Your general order doesn't go into affect for another hour and a
half.
GOVERNOR [OC]: I assure you, they're not targeting your crewmen or the
Denobulans.
ARCHER: Then who are they shooting at?
GOVERNOR [OC]: Soldiers from the previous regime. They've refused to
accept the shift in power.
ARCHER: That's not my concern. You're endangering my people. You've got
to wait until they're in the clear.
GOVERNOR [OC]: I'm afraid that's impossible.
ARCHER: It's what we agreed to.
GOVERNOR [OC]: We agreed to give you three days, nothing more.
ARCHER: Target the patrol that's firing at those caves.
GOVERNOR [OC]: If you attack us, we'll retaliate.
T'POL: We're locked onto the co-ordinates.
ARCHER: Charge weapons.
GOVERNOR [OC]: Do you really want to be at war with us, Captain?
ARCHER: The question is do you want to be at war with us. It sounds
like you've got your hands full already. Stick to our original
agreement and you won't find yourself fighting on two fronts.
 [Caves]
 (While
Tucker and Reed haul themselves slowly up their ropes, the Denobulans
'walk' up the rock face remarkably like Sulibans would. Yolen looks down from a ledge.)
YOLEN: Commander, the bombing seems to have
stopped.
REED: We need to get out of here before it starts up again.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX:
You wanted to see me?
HUDAK: What you said about your son. You seem sincere in your desire to
set an example for your children. I wish more Denobulans felt that way.
PHLOX: Many do. Perhaps if you met more of us.
HUDAK: That seems unlikely.
PHLOX: Is that all you wanted to say to me?
HUDAK: You made me think about my own family. I have children as well.
I've decided to accept your treatment.
 [Caves]
 (Trip
is hauling Travis up to the next ledge. Travis is holding onto a load
of rock sample boxes, but drops one.)
YOLEN: My speleothems!
TUCKER: Forget about them.
YOLEN: Fortunately, I have some other samples in my case.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Try them again.
HOSHI: Enterprise to Commander Tucker. Please respond.
ARCHER: Prep Shuttlepod one. Have a security team meet me in the Launch
bay.
T'POL: The Xantoras have mobilized their military patrols. They'll
detect a shuttle launch.
ARCHER: Noted.
TUCKER [OC]: Tucker to Enterprise.
ARCHER: You're cutting it pretty close, Trip. The deadline passed two
hours ago.
 [Shuttlepod]
 TUCKER:
Better late than never.
ARCHER [OC]: The Denobulans?
TUCKER: All aboard. Along with some very rare speleothems.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
Captain, there's a small craft closing on the shuttlepod. It's a patrol
ship.
ARCHER: You've got company, Trip.
 [Shuttlepod]
 REED: I
see them. Bearing one eight four mark two seven.
(The patrol ship fires on the shuttlepod, shaking them up a bit.)
REED: Minimal damage. They're using low-power particle beams.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Do you need assistance?
TUCKER [OC]: Stand by.
 [Shuttlepod]
 TUCKER:
I think they're just trying to give us a little kick in the pants.
(As the shuttlepod heads into space, the patrol ship turns around.)
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER:
How is he?
PHLOX: He'll be a bit groggy when he comes out of the anesthesia, but
the procedure was successful.
ARCHER: I'm glad you didn't defy my orders. I wasn't looking forward to
throwing you in irons.
PHLOX: Neither was I.
ARCHER: How did you convince him?
PHLOX: You must be familiar with the principle of doctor patient
confidentiality. Of course, you could always order me to tell you.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER:
Doctor Phlox wanted to see you off, but he's busy treating one of my
crewmen who was injured on the surface.
HUDAK: That's all right, Captain. The Doctor and I spent more than
enough time together.
ARCHER: It's too bad your research on Xantoras was cut short.
HUDAK: The time I spent on your ship was an education in itself. Thank
you for your help.
ARCHER: You do know we came here to rescue three Denobulan geologists?
HUDAK: Phlox told me.
ARCHER: I understand they'll be heading home on your transport. I hope
that won't be a problem.
HUDAK: Have they been informed that I'll be travelling with them?
ARCHER: I had a talk with them.
HUDAK: And what was their response?
ARCHER: They're willing, if you are.
 [Sickbay]
 (There
are no patients present.)
PHLOX: Computer, begin recording. Dear Mettus, I know it's been time
since I've written, and I know chances are slim that you'll respond to
this letter. However, something has happened that compels me to try to
reach you again. I've had an experience that has opened many old
wounds. As painful as it's been, it's also changed something in me. I
hope, if you're willing to listen, it might begin to change something
in you.

  [Bridge]
(Enterprise is flying close to a massive star.)
T'POL: It's losing mass at an extraordinary rate.
REED: How long before it goes supernova?
T'POL: A hundred years, maybe two.
ARCHER: Too bad we won't be around. It's going to be one hell of an
explosion.
T'POL: Speak for yourself. I might very well be around.
TUCKER: Can't forget Vulcan longevity, Captain. A hundred years from
now? How old would that make you?
ARCHER: No earth ship has ever been within ten light years of a
hypergiant. How much farther can we move in?
T'POL: Our hull temperature is approaching eleven hundred degrees. It
would be unsafe to get any closer.
ARCHER: Then we'll have to run our scans from here. Tell Astrometrics
to get going. I'm sure they're champing at the bit.
REED: We may not be able to get any closer, but someone else has.
ARCHER: You found a ship?
REED: Bearing two six one mark four. They must be at least twenty
thousand kilometres farther in than we are.
ARCHER: Let's see her. (A ship comes up on the viewscreen.) ARCHER: Recognise
it?
T'POL: No.
ARCHER: Hail them.
HOSHI: The interference is pretty heavy, sir.
ARCHER: Then try audio. This is Captain Archer of the starship
Enterprise. I assume you've detected us.
DRENNIK [OC]: Captain Drennik. Where have you travelled from?
ARCHER: The Sol system. And you?
DRENNIK [OC]: We come from a system called Vissia, more than twenty
five light years from here. We saw you arrive yesterday. I assume
you're here to study the hypergiant.
ARCHER: My species has never seen one up close.
DRENNIK [OC]: It is quite a sight. Have you measured its rate of
nucleosynthesis?
ARCHER: I'm afraid we haven't developed the technology to do that.
DRENNIK [OC]: If you don't mind eliminating the development stage, I'd
be more than happy to help you modify your sensors.
ARCHER: Thank you. I'm not sure we have anything to offer you in
return.
DRENNIK [OC]: You could invite us to visit your ship. Meeting new
species is one of our primary goals.
ARCHER: It's one of ours as well. We'd be honoured to have you join us
for dinner.
DRENNIK [OC]: We'll be there within the hour. I look forward to it.
(Ends transmission.)
TUCKER: It'll be nice to have a First Contact where no one's thinking
about charging weapons.
ARCHER: Tell Chef we're going to have some visitors.
 [Captain's
mess]
(Enterprise is docked with the much larger Vissian ship, and the crews
are socialising. Vissians have big spectacle-like bones around the
eyes.)
DRENNIK: Trinesium can withstand temperatures up to eighteen thousand
degrees. We've been using it to construct our hulls for over a century.
ARCHER: You must be able to get down into the photosphere of most
G-type stars.
DRENNIK: We can get even deeper with our stratopod. It's got twice the
shielding.
ARCHER: Flying into stars is a long way off for us.
DRENNIK: Your technology will evolve. What's important is that you're
explorers.
ARCHER: We have gone farther than any other humans.
DRENNIK: You might enjoy going even farther. I'm taking the stratopod
into the hydrogen layer tomorrow. I'd be pleased to have you join me.
ARCHER: I am an explorer.
 [Mess
hall]
 (Tucker
is entertaining two Vissian women.)
TUCKER: This is called vanilla and this is chocolate. Give it a try.
(They pick up their spoons.) TUCKER: Oh no, wait. You've got to eat the cherry
first. This.
TRAISTANA: Why?
TUCKER: Well, you just do.
VEYLO: A human tradition?
TUCKER: Exactly.
REED: Aren't you going to introduce me?
TUCKER: This is Malcolm Reed, our Armoury officer. This is Traistana, a
xenobiologist, and Veylo is a tactical officer.
REED: Very pleased to meet you.
TUCKER: Why don't you sit down? The Captain did ask us to mingle.
REED: Indeed. I was just speaking with their Chief Engineer and his
wife. Maybe you should say hello. (Tucker hands his sundae over to Reed.)
TUCKER:  See you later.
(We follow him to another table with a man and two women, one of whom
is not eating.)
TUCKER: I'm told you're the Chief Engineer.
ENGINEER: Commander Tucker. Lieutenant Reed pointed you out. Please,
sit down.
TUCKER: Thank you.
ENGINEER: This is my wife, Calla.
CALLA: I'm glad you invited us here.
TUCKER: Are you enjoying your food?
CALLA: Oh, very much.
ENGINEER: I hope you get the chance to sample our food. It's more
fragrant than yours.
TUCKER: I look forward to it. I'd also like to get a peek at your
engine room.
ENGINEER: By all means. (Tucker speaks to the third person at the table.)
TUCKER: Trip Tucker. Welcome aboard.
COGENITOR: (startled) Hello.
CALLA: It has no name. It's our cogenitor.
TUCKER: Cogenitor?
CALLA: We're hoping to have a baby.
TUCKER: Ah.
ENGINEER: Our warp core emits omicron radiation. I'd recommend you
speak with your doctor about an inoculation.
TUCKER: Sure thing.
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox gives Tucker a hypospray.)  PHLOX:
This should do it.
TUCKER: So, you've heard of these cogenitors.
PHLOX: Not all species are limited to two sexes. In fact, I have it on
good authority that the Rigellians have four, or was it five?
TUCKER: So you're saying that this man or woman or whatever, is a third
sex?
PHLOX: That's exactly what I'm saying.
TUCKER: And she, it, is part of the impregnation process.
PHLOX: Precisely.
TUCKER: I'm pretty familiar with how it works with two sexes, but
PHLOX: Multi-gendered techniques aren't always the same, but in this
case I imagine the cogenitor provides an enzyme which facilitates
conception.
TUCKER: What do you mean by provides?
PHLOX: Well, first, the female has to
TUCKER: No, no, no, don't tell me. I don't think I want to know.
PHLOX: Oh, well. I have pictures.
TUCKER: I think I'll pass. So how long is this going to last? I might
want to stay there for a while.
PHLOX: It should protect you from omicron radiation for about twelve
years.
TUCKER: That should be enough. Thanks, Doc.
PHLOX: Keep an open mind, Commander. You came on this mission to meet
other species, no matter how many genders they may have.
 [Stratopod]
 (It's a
small, two man craft with a big window at the front.)
DRENNIK: There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of
in your philosophy.
ARCHER: Where'd you hear that?
DRENNIK: Hamlet, Act One, Scene Five. Your Communications Officer was
kind enough to provide us with some of your literature. I assumed you
approved.
ARCHER: Absolutely, but I didn't think you'd be quoting it the next
day.
DRENNIK: We retain most of what we read.
ARCHER: And you obviously read pretty quickly.
DRENNIK: After I finished Shakespeare last night, I began reading the
plays of Sophocles. What do you recommend after that?
ARCHER: Seems like you're picking the good ones all by yourself. That's
got to be ionised hydrogen.
DRENNIK: It's generating magnetic currents.
ARCHER: I've got friends back at home who are not going to believe
this.
DRENNIK: I have friends who'll be equally impressed with Macbeth. We're
almost into the chromosphere.
 [Vissian
Engineering]
ENGINEER: The antimatter stream is compressed before the deuterium's
injected into the core.
TUCKER: So you don't need magnetic confinement.
ENGINEER: Let me bring up the schematics.
TUCKER: Where we come from, Earth, there are only two genders.
ENGINEER: That's true of most worlds.
TUCKER: I don't mean to pry but, does every family have a cogenitor?
ENGINEER: That wouldn't be very efficient. They are only needed when a
couple's trying to have a child.
TUCKER: And when they're not?
ENGINEER: The cogenitor is assigned to another couple. They make up
about three percent of our population, which seems to be a perfect
ratio. Nature has a way of finding the right balance.
TUCKER: Is the one I met the only one on your ship?
ENGINEER: The only one. Once Calla and I are finished with it, I doubt
it'll be needed before we return home. Would you like to take a closer
look at the plasma converters?
TUCKER: I would. Thanks. So, does it live with you and your wife?
ENGINEER: We keep it in our quarters, yes.
TUCKER: What does it do when you're not
ENGINEER: It eats, sleeps. There's not much else for it to do.
TUCKER: What about school?
ENGINEER: They only serve one purpose. Sending them to school would
make no sense. Why are you so curious about them?
TUCKER: Humans are very curious.
ENGINEER: You might find this difficult to believe, but this polymer is
composed of over two hundred naturally occurring elements.
TUCKER: That's impossible.
ENGINEER: I read in your database that you've discovered only ninety
two. I understand how this might seem unnerving.
TUCKER: A lot of things around here do, but I'm trying to keep an open
mind.
 [Ready
room]
 T'POL:
How long will you be gone?
ARCHER: Close to three days. The circumference is nearly a billion
kilometres. We'll be scanning surface features that are undetectable from
higher altitudes.
T'POL: Three days is a long time to be confined to such a small craft,
especially with a person you've just met.
ARCHER: I think I'll survive. These people are fascinating, T'Pol. They
have a lot to offer us. This could be the beginning of a beautiful
relationship. Which reminds me. They've asked us for a sampling of
films. I've put together a few suggestions.
T'POL: I'll see to it.
ARCHER: You're in charge.
T'POL: Of the ship or the movies?
 [Engineering]
 (Tucker
is working on the top of the warp core.)
T'POL: Commander.
TUCKER: Captain left yet?
T'POL: He'll be gone for three days. (Tucker climbs down.) T'POL: He asked that
you download these films and transfer them to the Vissians' database.
TUCKER: Did you meet their Engineer?
T'POL: Briefly.
TUCKER: He and his wife are trying to have a baby.
T'POL: How interesting.
TUCKER: There was someone else with them. They called her a cogenitor.
You know what that is?
T'POL: A third gender. Why do you call it her?
TUCKER: Well, she looks more like a her than a him. They treat her like
a pet, kept in her room, not taught to read or write, no name. Porthos
has a name.
T'POL: It's not our place to judge the customs of other cultures.
TUCKER: We're not talking about taking your shoes off when you walk
into someone's house. This cogenitor's treated like one of Phlox's
leeches. You pull it out of its tank when you need it, then you throw
it back in.
T'POL: Tri-gender reproduction is not uncommon.
TUCKER: That's not what I'm talking about. This is a question of human
rights.
T'POL: They're not human. Captain Archer hopes to develop a productive
relationship with this species. It might be best you kept your opinions
to yourself.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX:
It's good advice. Mating habits are often quite personal. Some species
aren't comfortable discussing them.
TUCKER: I'm not interested in discussing their habits. I'm concerned
with the way they treat this cogenitor.
PHLOX: They're most likely one and the same.
TUCKER: Yeah, well, that doesn't make it right.
PHLOX: It's not a question of right or wrong.
TUCKER: You scanned them when they came on board. Don't you always do
that?
PHLOX: They weren't carrying any pathogens that would be dangerous to
our crew.
TUCKER: Is there anything you can tell me about the mental capacity of
this cogenitor? Is it any different than the males and females?
PHLOX: I'm afraid I didn't take any neural scans.
TUCKER: Is that something I could do?
PHLOX: Why would you want to?
TUCKER: Just curious.
PHLOX: I suppose you could.
 [Mess
hall]
 REED:
Fruit and cheese compliment each other.
VEYLO: So cheese comes in eight varieties?
REED: Actually there are hundreds, maybe thousands.
VEYLO: What made you choose these?
REED: They have the strongest smells of anything we have on board. You
said our food was aromatically bland. I thought this might change your
mind. Try some.
VEYLO: Mild, but very nice.
REED: How about this one? (He offers a blue-veined cheese.)
VEYLO: The odour is a little spicier. What's it called?
REED: Stilton. Chef says it's pretty pungent.
VEYLO: Haven't you ever tried it?
REED: Not for a long time.
VEYLO: Here. (Reed recoils from the Stilton under his nose.)
REED: I'd say that's more than a
little spicy. (He eats it.)
VEYLO: And what's this called?
REED: Alsatian Muenster.
VEYLO: Interesting. (Veylo sniffs it then offers it to Reed.) VEYLO: Don't you
find it sensual?
REED: Very.
VEYLO: Can we visit the Armoury later? I'm anxious to see your tactical
array.
REED: There's an old Earth expression. I'll show you mine if you show
me yours.
 [Stratopod]
DRENNIK: Your father. That's hard to imagine. The man who developed
warp drive on my world lived nearly a thousand years ago.
ARCHER: I'm surprised your ancestors never made it to Earth.
DRENNIK: We don't believe in travelling great distances. There's far
too much to see close to home.
ARCHER: Well, maybe now you have a reason to visit us. It's not that
far.
DRENNIK: I'm sure we can make an exception. I'm going to take us down
to the edge of the photosphere. It might get a little turbulent.
ARCHER: Fine with me.
 [Vissian
Engineering]
ENGINEER: When the engine reaches critical mass, a mixture of positrons
and neutrinos is injected into the chamber. Watch. (Tucker looks at computer display.)
TUCKER: The efficiency is up over thirty
percent. Pretty impressive.
ENGINEER: It's possible this technology could be modified for
Enterprise.
TUCKER: We'd be very grateful. We don't have any married couples on
Enterprise. Do they give you special quarters?
ENGINEER: The captain's very generous.
TUCKER: I wish ours was. I've got a room not half the size of this one.
I'd love to get a look at your quarters sometime. If I could describe
it to Captain Archer, he might consider expanding my living space.
ENGINEER: Why don't you join us for dinner tonight? You did agree to
try our food.
TUCKER: Are you telling me you have a dining room?
ENGINEER: We'll try not to prepare anything too pungent.
 [Living
quarters]
 (It's
dinnertime, and the Engineer and Calla watch as Tucker sniffs his food
before eating it.)
TUCKER: It's pretty mild, considering the smell.
CALLA: For us, the aroma is far more important than the taste.
TUCKER: This must have taken you all day.
CALLA: If I had all day, I would have prepared a far more scented meal.
ENGINEER: Calla's in charge of the Microgravity Lab. We usually don't
have much time for cooking.
TUCKER: Will your cogenitor be joining us?
ENGINEER: It rarely eats more than one meal a day.
TUCKER: Oh, so in our mess hall
CALLA: Bringing a cogenitor to your ship was an exception.
TUCKER: Too bad. I was hoping to say hello.
CALLA: Why would you want to do that?
ENGINEER: Commander Tucker is very curious about our reproductive
process. Humans are bi-gendered.
CALLA: I'll see if it's awake.
 [Sickbay]
(Tucker looks at medical display.)  TUCKER:
Which one's the cogenitor?
PHLOX: Right here. Her synaptic density and neural mass are almost
identical to the other two. Your cogenitor appears to be no more or
less intelligent than the male and female.
 [Stratopod]
 ARCHER:
I wouldn't mind taking a turn at the helm.
DRENNIK: Our navigation controls are not like yours. They're based on
five spatial axes.
ARCHER: I've been watching you. I think I can handle it.
(Drennik slides the control console over to Archer's seat. After a few
moments, Archer gets the ship flying smoothly again.)
DRENNIK: You obviously have some experience.
ARCHER: A little. There's a pretty big flare forming below us. I think
I can loop around it, let you get a better scan.
DRENNIK: It's giving off a lot of magnetic flux. It may cause false
readings in the navigation sensors.
ARCHER: I'll keep an eye on it.
 [Vissian
Engineering]
 TUCKER:
So, by rotating the quantum inverters, you've tripled the antimatter
flux?
ENGINEER: Exactly. Three more, and I'll be finished.
TUCKER: I haven't eaten anything since this morning. If you don't mind,
I'll go to your mess hall, see what they're serving.
ENGINEER: If you wait until I'm done, I'll show you how to get there.
TUCKER: I'll be all right. I'm sure I can find the way. See you in a
little while?
 [Living
quarters]
 (Tucker
rings twice, and the door is opened.)
COGENITOR: They're not here.
TUCKER: I came to see you.
COGENITOR: Why?
TUCKER: I brought you this. It'll teach you how to read.
(Inside, Tucker shows the PADD to a very uncertain cogenitor.)
TUCKER: Now you try it.
COGENITOR: I don't understand.
TUCKER: You just touch the word, then you'll hear it pronounced. Go
ahead, try it.
PADD VOICE: Today.
TUCKER: That's right. Now go to the next one.
PADD VOICE: Today we're
TUCKER: Good. Again.
COGENITOR: Why are you doing this? It's not right for me to read.
TUCKER: Who told you that?
COGENITOR: You shouldn't be here.
TUCKER: You're as capable as they are. As smart as they are.
COGENITOR: That's not true. They need me to have children.
TUCKER: It's not a question of what they need. You have the same
rights, to learn, to choose how you're going to live, to have a name.
COGENITOR: That may be true on your world but not on mine.
TUCKER: When Calla gives birth, who's going to raise the baby? Who's
going to take care of it?
COGENITOR: They will.
TUCKER: Why? You're just as crucial in creating the child as they are.
COGENITOR: You don't understand.
TUCKER: Okay, maybe. But we took scans. My doctor says you have the
same potential as they do. The only thing that sets you apart is your
gender. You're no more different than they are from each other. Haven't
you ever wished you could read? It won't hurt you, you know. There's
nothing to be afraid of.
PADD VOICE: Today we're going. Today we're going to. Today we're going
to read.
 [Stratopod]
 ARCHER:
I'm starting to get the hang of this. I could take us down a little
closer if you'd like.
DRENNIK: Another ten thousand metres and I'll be able to get a particle
count of the photosphere.
ARCHER: Aye, aye, Captain. Ten thousand metres it is.
(Down they go, and it gets a little bumpy, but Archer is grinning.)
DRENNIK: Are you all right?
ARCHER: Absolutely.
DRENNIK: If you can keep us at this altitude a little while longer.
ARCHER: No problem.
 [Armoury]
 VEYLO:
Are these armed with photonic warheads?
REED: Photonic? I'm not familiar with that.
VEYLO: I'm afraid our weapons are somewhat more sophisticated than
yours.
REED: This technology must seem pretty antiquated to you.
VEYLO: Where I come from, antiquated can be very quaint.
REED: Is that how you see us? Quaint?
VEYLO: And charming. What sort of power source do these use? (The phase
pistols and rifles.)
REED: Sarium micro-cells. I suppose that's very quaint, too.
VEYLO: Not at all. We charge our weapons the same way.
REED: Maybe you'd like to see the phase-cannon assembly.
VEYLO: Please. (Reed unlocks and removes the hatch.)
REED: After you.(He enjoys the
sight of a tightly-trousered rear end.)
REED: It has multiphasic emitters and a maximum yield of eighty
gigajoules.
VEYLO: Impressive.
REED: I'm sorry it's so cramped in here.
VEYLO: Don't be. I've wanted to get a little closer to you all day.
REED: Really?
VEYLO: I was hoping to spend some intimate time with you. Maybe we
could sleep together tonight. (Reed stands up suddenly and hits his head on a pipe.)
REED: On Earth,
it's customary to ask a woman to dinner first before spending the night
with her.
VEYLO: It's very different on Vissia. It's only when a woman enjoys her
intimate time with a man that she'll join him for dinner.
 [Living
quarters]
(The cogenitor is reading from a Vissian book.)
COGENITOR: The Didiron mountain range
runs through the upper plains of the Great Continent.
TUCKER: Amazing.
COGENITOR: The text describes far more impressive peaks.
TUCKER: I don't mean the mountains, I mean your reading.
COGENITOR: The fauna and flora vary greatly on either side of the
central plateau.
TUCKER: Look how much you've accomplished in a single day. And
reading's just the tip of the iceberg. You could study all sorts of
things. History, science. Engineering's not bad. You don't have to sit
in this room all day.
COGENITOR: They would never let me learn those things.
TUCKER: Then you've got to convince them. It's not just learning. It's
experiencing things. Music, swimming in the ocean. You do have oceans
on your planet?
COGENITOR: Yes.
TUCKER: And how about those Didiron Mountains? Reading about them is
one thing, climbing them is another.
COGENITOR: I'd like to climb a mountain.
TUCKER: There you go. That's the right attitude. You keep at it. I've
got to get back. They think I'm at the Astrometrics lab. But I'll see
you as soon as I can.
COGENITOR: Trip?
TUCKER: Yeah?
COGENITOR: I'd like my name to be Trip, just like yours.
TUCKER: Actually, my name's Charles.
COGENITOR: Then I would like my name to be Charles.
TUCKER: I'm flattered.
 [Stratopod]
DRENNIK: There's a flare forming ahead.
ARCHER: I don't see it.
DRENNIK: You will. Turn the axis forty degrees to port. I think we can
bank around it.
ARCHER: It's too big.
DRENNIK: Take us up. Try to get over it.
ARCHER: We're not going to make it.
DRENNIK: Increase speed.
ARCHER: It won't be enough.
DRENNIK: What are you doing?
ARCHER: If you can't get over a wave, you got to dive through it. (The
little pod heads through the enormous solar flare.)
DRENNIK: Where did you learn to do that?
ARCHER: North shore of Oahu, body surfing. I think it's time you took
the helm back.
 [Corridor]
COGENITOR: Would you be punished if they find out you've brought me
here?
TUCKER: Punished? No, but they might get a little angry.
COGENITOR: I would be punished.
TUCKER: Maybe I should take you back.
COGENITOR: No, no, I want to see more.
TUCKER: Okay. We'll just have to be sure no one spots us. (further
along) This is our transporter. It turns things into a matter stream
that can be sent just about anywhere, within two thousand kilometres or
so. Then it gets reassembled.
COGENITOR: Could it send a Vissian?
TUCKER: I don't see why not.
COGENITOR: I'd like to try.
TUCKER: I don't think that would be a good idea.
COGENITOR: Could I see where you work?
TUCKER: Sure. Follow me.
 [Engineering]
 (Tucker and the cogenitor
go in through an unobtrusive hatch onto an upper walkway rather than
using the main doors.)
TUCKER: Coast is clear. That's our main engine. Fastest one in
Starfleet. I've had it up to warp five point one.
COGENITOR: I think my ship has something like this, but I've never seen
it.
TUCKER: Your ship has an engine that's a lot more sophisticated than
this one.
COGENITOR: Do you live here?
TUCKER: No. My quarters are on B deck. Have you ever seen a movie?
 [Tucker's
quarters]
 (Tucker and the cogenitor are going
through the movie list on a monitor.)
TUCKER: It's not easy picking a movie for somebody who's never seen one
before. What would you think about a Western? No, not a Western. I
don't think a musical would be right, either. Got it. The Day the Earth
Stood Still. Nothing like a little science fiction to break you in.
COGENITOR: It's a story about your planet?
TUCKER: Yeah, but it's fiction. The Earth never really stood still. Sit
down. You're going to love this.
(She sits and watches the classic black and white movie, entranced.
Later, they are sitting cross-legged on the floor playing Go.)
COGENITOR: Why were the humans so afraid of Klaatu and his android?
TUCKER: Well, before we made first contact with the Vulcans, the people
of Earth were pretty violent. They had a hard time trusting things they
didn't understand. The characters in the film knew nothing about
Klaatu. Who he was, where he came from. So, they tried to kill him.
COGENITOR: I understand. (She places her white piece and takes a lonely
black one.) COGENITOR: Does this mean I've won?
TUCKER: No one's beaten me at this in the last two years.
COGENITOR: Tell me about Westerns. Maybe I could watch a Western next.
TUCKER: It's getting late. We'd better get you back before they realise
you're gone.
 [Situation
room]
 T'POL:
I've been told you're no longer welcome aboard the Vissian ship. Why?
TUCKER: I wasn't exactly where I was supposed to be.
T'POL: No, you weren't. You told them you were going to the
Astrometrics Lab. They tried to contact you, but you weren't there.
Then they tried their mess hall. You weren't there either.
TUCKER: I was with the cogenitor.
T'POL: Where?
TUCKER: At first, in her quarters. Actually, they're not her quarters.
They belong to the Chief Engineer and his wife. She gets a room to
sleep in, and if she's real good she can use their living space.
T'POL: Why were you there?
TUCKER: I'm teaching her how to read.
T'POL: Her education is not your concern.
TUCKER: What education?
T'POL: Where else did you go?
TUCKER: I brought her here, gave her a little tour, showed her a movie.
T'POL: It appears you're doing everything you can to undermine the
Captain's wishes.
TUCKER: One day, that's all it took her. In one day she was reading a
geography text.
T'POL: First Contacts are important to the Captain. You may very well
have damaged this one irreparably.
TUCKER: You're not listening to a word I'm saying.
 [Engineering]
 (Tucker
is at the warp engine when someone clears their throat to attract his
attention.)
TUCKER: I didn't see you. How you doing? You all right?
COGENITOR: They don't want to help me. They don't want me to climb
mountains.
TUCKER: Don't worry, they will. Give it time.
COGENITOR: They're angry with you. They'll leave as soon as our captain
returns. They won't help me, but you can. I want to stay here, please.
 [Stratopod]
 (The
little ship is returning to its big parent.)
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise.
T'POL [OC]: Go ahead.
ARCHER: That was one hell of a ride. I'll tell you about it in a couple
of hours. We've got a lot of data to download into their computers.
T'POL [OC]: I think it would be best if you come back immediately, sir.
There's been an incident.
 [Ready
room]
 ARCHER:
Where is she?
TUCKER: It's not exactly a she, sir.
ARCHER: Where?
TUCKER: In my quarters.
ARCHER: How long ago did this happen?
TUCKER: Last night after supper.
T'POL: They demanded that she be returned immediately.
TUCKER: I did exactly what you'd do, Captain. It's not like I had much
choice. I wasn't going to just
ARCHER: Will you excuse us, Sub-commander?
(T'Pol leaves.)
ARCHER: I might have expected something like this from a first-year
recruit. But not you. You did exactly what I'd do? If that's true, then
I've done a pretty lousy job setting an example around here. You're a
senior officer on this ship. You're privy to the moral challenges I've
had to face. You know I've wrestled with the fine line between doing
what I think is right and interfering with other species. So don't tell
me you know what I would have done when I don't even know what I would
have done!
TUCKER: I didn't think it would hurt to teach her how to read.
ARCHER: Then you didn't think hard enough. We're out here to meet new
species, not tell them what to do.
TUCKER: Teaching her to read is no different than you giving them books
or movies.
ARCHER: Giving them books is a lot different than suggesting they defy
their culture. And they asked me for the books. Did she ask you to
teach her how to read?
TUCKER: No, sir.
ARCHER: And sneaking into her quarters, bringing her on Enterprise,
lying about where you were going, why? (silence) Come with me.
 [Tucker's
quarters]
COGENITOR: You don't understand. I can't go back.
ARCHER: Just until we resolve this.
COGENITOR: Trip said I have the same rights as they do.
ARCHER: It's not our place to tell you what rights you have. I'm sorry.
COGENITOR: Are you going to force me to leave?
 [Captain's
mess]
DRENNIK: Some men can work together for years without creating the
friendship and bond that we did in only two days. I'm certain we can
resolve this.
ARCHER: I'm afraid it may not be that simple. On my world, when someone
asks for asylum it has to be given serious consideration.
DRENNIK: We're not on your world, and I doubt whether this person truly
understood what your engineer was suggesting.
ARCHER: I've been told this person is just as capable of understanding
as any of you are.
ENGINEER: Why are we debating this? The cogenitor belongs on our ship.
Or are you suggesting my wife and I abandon our plans to have a child?
ARCHER: I've been asked to give sanctuary to someone who believes she's
been treated unfairly. I can't ignore that.
CALLA: We're the ones being treated unfairly. Do you know how long
we've waited to be given a cogenitor?
ARCHER: Given? You sound like you're talking about some inanimate
object.
ENGINEER: You have no right to judge us. You know nothing about our
culture. What if one of your stewards, the men who are forced to serve
you food, what if they should ask us for asylum?
ARCHER: They're not forced to do anything.
ENGINEER: I apologise. But it's easy to misunderstand someone when you
know nothing about their culture.
ARCHER: You can't expect me to ignore someone when they ask for my
protection.
DRENNIK: We're in no rush to leave. Take your time. Consider what we've
said.
 [Corridor]
(T'Pol reassures Archer.)T'POL:
You shouldn't have misgivings. You've made the right choice.
 [Tucker's
quarters]
(Tucker and the cogenitor are listening to music when the doorbell rings.)
TUCKER: Come in.
 [Bridge]
 (The
two ships have disengaged and gone their separate ways.)
DRENNIK [on viewscreen]: Captain Archer.
ARCHER: I'm afraid Shakespeare only wrote thirty six plays. So it might
be best if you take your time memorising them.
DRENNIK [on viewscreen]: By all means. I hope yesterday's unfortunate
incident won't interfere with future relations between our people.
ARCHER: You sure you don't have an extra stratopod you could spare?
DRENNIK [on viewscreen]: I'm sure your Starfleet will develop one soon
enough. Goodbye, Captain.
ARCHER: Safe journey. (Ends transmission.) ARCHER: Time to say goodbye to the
hypergiant. Prepare to get underway, Travis.
 [Archer's
quarters]
 (Archer
is sitting on his bed, stroking Porthos and reading a book when the
comm. beeps.)
ARCHER: Go ahead.
HOSHI [OC]: There's a call coming in from the Vissian Captain, sir. He
sounds upset.
ARCHER: Put him through.
 [Ready room]
(The doorbell chimes.)
ARCHER: Come in.
TUCKER: You wanted to see me, Captain?
ARCHER: I was just told that the Vissian cogenitor died.
TUCKER: What? How?
ARCHER: Suicide, Trip. She killed herself.
TUCKER: That can't be. Why? It's my fault. I'm responsible.
ARCHER: You're damn right you are. And it's not just her. There's a
child who won't be conceived because of this, at least not for a long
while. It's time you learned to weigh the possible repercussions of
your actions. You've always been impulsive. Maybe this will teach you a
lesson.
TUCKER: I understand.
ARCHER: Do you? I'm not so sure you do. You knew you had no business
interfering with those people, but you just couldn't let it alone. You
thought you were doing the right thing. I might agree if this was
Florida, or Singapore, but it's not, is it. We're in deep space and a
person is dead. A person who'd still be alive if we hadn't made First
Contact. I guess I haven't been very successful at getting through to
you. If I had, you would have thought a lot harder before doing what
you did.
TUCKER: You're not responsible.
ARCHER: Dismissed. (Archer turns his back to look out of the porthole.)
TUCKER: Captain?

Regeneration
 Mission date: Mar 1, 2153
Original Airdate: 7 May, 2003
  [Arctic Circle, Earth]
 (It is
still a cold, snow-covered landscape that the transport lands in,
despite the current global warming predictions. Three figures in thermal suits are scanning for
something.)
DRAKE: (older man) I think this is the place. (They stare at the
wreckage.) DRAKE: Take a look around. (A woman uncovers a corpse in the snow.)
ROONEY: Over here!
Definitely humanoid, but I don't recognise the species.
DRAKE: Seems very well preserved.
MONINGER: (younger, taller man) Getting him out of here's going to be a
delicate operation.
DRAKE: Drake to Arctic One.
VOICE [OC]: Go ahead.
DRAKE: Set up a base camp. Get Alpha Team started.
VOICE [OC]: Acknowledged.
DRAKE: Contact Starfleet. Tell Commander Williams he owes me a bottle
of Scotch.
VOICE [OC]: Sir?
DRAKE: He'll know what it means. Drake out.
ROONEY: I'm picking up EM traces a few dozen metres under the glacier.
There's a lot more here than we're seeing. (she heads off following her
scanner signals) We've got another one!
 [Base
camp]
 (Two
cybernetic looking corpses are laid out, and a mechanical arm gets put
on a table.)
DRAKE: I give up. What is it?
MONINGER: An arm. It's his.
DRAKE: You're joking.
MONINGER: From what I can tell, it was integrated into his circulatory
and nervous systems. He could probably operate it like it was his own
flesh and blood.
DRAKE: I met a Vulcan scientist who wore a prosthesis. He lost his
forearm. It's pretty sophisticated, but it doesn't compare to this.
MONINGER: Take a look at the eyepiece. Judging by the optics, I'd say
he could see most of the EM spectrum.
DRAKE: Did you run a genetic analysis?
MONINGER: That's even more interesting. They don't have much in common.
They belong to two different species.
DRAKE: Transmit your findings to Starfleet. Maybe they'll find a match
in their database.
MONINGER: Right away.
ROONEY: Sir, I've run every test in the book. I still can't identify
this alloy.
DRAKE: What about this?
ROONEY: I thought it was simple thermal damage until I found signs of
antimatter residue.
DRAKE: Maybe their warp drive overloaded.
ROONEY: That could explain why there's not much debris. I did find some
carbon traces.
DRAKE: Could you date them?
ROONEY: This debris has been here for about a hundred years.
(They are distracted by a drill fitting on the prosthetic arm starting
to whirl, and then stop again. Later -)
ROONEY: (at microscope) Take a look at this. Do you see those devices?
They're repairing the cell membranes.
DRAKE: What are they?
MONINGER: I believe you're looking at a form of nanotechnology. I found
thousands of these in both aliens. They're not just regenerating the
damaged tissue, they're repairing the mechanical components as well. As
far as I can tell, this arm's as good as new.
DRAKE: The Denobulans have experimented with nanotechnology, but they
have nothing like this.
MONINGER: Maybe we should move the bodies to Module three, put them
back in cold storage with the other samples. That way, we can examine
them later under controlled conditions.
DRAKE: Couldn't the bodies be damaged if we freeze them again?
MONINGER: I guess it's possible.
DRAKE: Then we should leave them here. Let the regeneration process
continue.
MONINGER: What if it revives more of their systems? We don't know
anything about this species or what they were doing here a hundred
years ago.
DRAKE: There's no reason to assume they're hostile.
MONINGER: They don't exactly look friendly.
DRAKE: Starfleet has asked us to find out everything we can. Keep them
here for now, we'll see what happens.
 [Arctic
crash site]
 DRAKE:
Anything?
ROONEY: Oh! Plenty.
DRAKE: You seem a little jumpy.
ROONEY: Cybernetic corpses, digging through frozen remains in the
middle of the night, why would I be jumpy?
DRAKE: I'd be more worried about the polar bears.
ROONEY: I've identified twenty two fragments of the outer hull. Each
one has the same curvature. I think this ship was a perfect sphere.
DRAKE: How big?
ROONEY: About six hundred metres in diameter.
DRAKE: The debris field could be a lot more extensive than we thought.
We might want to get another excavation team out here. (her scanner
beeps) What is it?
ROONEY: A warp signature. (It leads them to a cover.) ROONEY: Help me with this.
(They start to open it)
 [Base
camp]
(A researcher brings in a flask of hot drink.)RESEARCHER: Just what the doctor ordered.
MONINGER: Thanks.
RESEARCHER: How are your friends?
MONINGER: A little on the quiet side.
RESEARCHER: There's a broken heating unit in Module Three. They've
asked me to take a look. Will you be all right here? (Moninger gestures with the phase rifle.)
MONINGER: Go ahead. I'll be fine.
(Tis fellow researcher leaves, and Moninger pours himself a cup of
something hot, then knocks it over as a sound comes from behind him. He
checks the monitors. Still flat lines all round. He speaks to the pale corpse with the prosthetic eye.) 
MONINGER: Feeling better?
 [Arctic
crash site]
 ROONEY:
Deuterium residue. Might be some kind of warp coil.
DRAKE: Seems too small for a ship this size.
ROONEY: I'd like to bring it back to the lab, take a closer look.(Back at Base camp, one of
the medical monitors bursts into life, and Mister Eyepiece takes a deep
breath, then his eye opens. A
scream from the camp has Drake and Rooney rushing back.)
 [Base
camp}
 (They
burst into the lab to find a corpse is missing and Moninger lying on the floor.)
DRAKE: Here, here. Get me a
medical kit.
(Moninger is gasping, and his skin is starting to turn pale and
mottled, like the corpse. Rooney turns to face the alien who has come
up behind her.)
 [Starfleet
HQ - Forrest's office]
WILLIAMS: Admiral, there's a problem with the A-6 excavation team. The
Science Council hasn't heard from them in three days.
FORREST: Get a shuttle ready. (The
rescue team force their way through drifted snow to get into Research
Module C376. There is no one there.)
 [Situation
room]
(Looking at a sequence of still photos on the table top display.)
ARCHER: The Admiral thinks that they're humanoids enhanced with
technology. He believes they abducted the research team.
REED: We're a long way from the Arctic. What can we do?
ARCHER: Earth tracking stations spotted the transport leaving orbit at
warp three point nine.
TUCKER: That's impossible. Those transports can't exceed one point
four.
ARCHER: I think it's safe to assume these aliens reconfigured the
engines using technology from their own ship.
HOSHI: Does Starfleet know where the vessel is now?
ARCHER: Not exactly, but their heading puts them within a half dozen
light years of our current position. We've been ordered to find the
ship.
T'POL: It shouldn't be difficult to isolate their warp signature.
ARCHER: We'll start searching at these coordinates. Go to tactical
alert. Lay in a course.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
(Just Archer and Trip are left.)
TUCKER: Buried in the ice for a century.
ARCHER: Hard to believe anything could survive.
TUCKER: Handsome devil.
 [Armoury]
(Reed is studying the images of the aliens on a monitor.)
PHLOX: You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?
REED: Yes. The researchers gathered a great deal of biometric data on
these aliens, but I'm having trouble making heads or tails of it.
PHLOX: How can I help?
REED: Well, this arm might contain some sort of weapon. If I can
determine its yield, we'll have a better idea of what we're facing.
(Phlox operates the computer.) REED: What sort of people would replace
perfectly good body parts with cybernetic implants?
PHLOX: You, of all people, should be open-minded about technology.
REED: I don't have a problem with it, as long as it stays outside of my
skin.
PHLOX: If your heart was damaged, would you want me to replace it with
a synthetic organ, or would you rather die?
REED: That's different.
PHLOX: There's a species I once encountered in the Beta Magellan
system, the Bynars. When they're born, a surgeon removes the child's
parietal lobe and replaces it with a synaptic processor. I saw the
procedure performed once. It was very impressive.
REED: Yeah, I'm sure it was. Anything?
PHLOX: I don't see any evidence of a weapon.
REED: The research team was heavily armed. How did these aliens manage
to overpower them?
 [Ready
room]
 T'POL
[OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: We're receiving an automated distress call. It's from a
Tarkalean freighter.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI:
There's a lot of interference. To any ship within range, we're under
attack by an unknown species. Request immediate assistance. That's it,
sir.
ARCHER: How long to reach them?
TRAVIS: About an hour.
ARCHER: Set a course.
(As they arrive on the scene, a nasty green weapon is being used to try
and cut open the freighter.)
ARCHER: Open a channel. This is Captain Archer of the Starfleet vessel
Enterprise. Stand down your attack, or we'll open fire.
REED: They're charging weapons. (Enterprise is hit.) REED: Some kind of proton
burst. Those transports aren't normally armed.
T'POL: Obviously, the engines aren't the only system they've upgraded.
ARCHER: Any human biosigns?
T'POL: Nine on the Arctic transport. The readings are erratic. (Another
hit.)
ARCHER: Can you disable their weapons?
REED: I believe so.
(Two quick precision phase cannon shots.)
REED: Their weapons are down.
TRAVIS: They're going to warp.
ARCHER: Is there anyone alive on the Tarkalean ship?
T'POL: Two biosigns on their upper deck. I'm reading minimal life
support.
ARCHER: Hold our position. Get a shuttlepod ready. (to T'Pol) You have
the Bridge.
 [Sickbay]
 (The
patients have some pale and mottled patches, but are unconscious.)
PHLOX: The Tarkaleans should live but the nanoprobes have infiltrated
their autonomic systems. Their renal glands have been replaced with
devices like this. Essentially, these individuals are being transformed
into some sort of cybernetic hybrid.
ARCHER: You said the human biosigns were erratic.
T'POL: It's likely the researchers are going through a similar
transformation.
ARCHER: Can you remove the nanoprobes?
PHLOX: Not surgically. These devices are multiplying at an
extraordinary rate. I could never extract them all. I'm attempting to
slow their progress with a modified retrovirus, but so far I haven't
been very successful.
T'POL: Perhaps you should isolate them in the Decon chamber.
PHLOX: If you do that, I won't be able to treat them as effectively. I
don't believe they're a danger to the crew. ARCHER: I'm not so sure. I'll have
Malcolm post a guard. Keep me updated.
 [Ready
room]
 (Archer
is reading what looks like the transcript of a speech on his monitor.)
ARCHER: Come in.
T'POL: I've contacted Tarkalea. I told them we're doing everything we
can for their crewmen.
ARCHER: Any sign of the transport?
T'POL: Nothing.
ARCHER: There was something familiar about all this, but I couldn't put
my finger on it until I find this speech Zefram Cochrane made eighty
nine years ago. When I was a kid, I read everything I could about him.
It took me a while, but I finally found it in the database. He was
giving a commencement address at Princeton when he started to talk
about what really happened during First Contact. He mentioned a group
of cybernetic creatures from the future who tried to stop his first
warp flight when he was living in Montana. He said they were defeated
by a group of humans who were also from the future.
T'POL: As I recall, Cochrane was famous for his imaginative stories. He
was also known to be frequently intoxicated.
ARCHER: No one took him seriously, and he recanted the whole thing a
few years later. But you have to admit, there are similarities.
T'POL: (reading) He said their ultimate goal was to enslave the human
race.
ARCHER: If he was right, they might be heading back to their homeworld
so they can try again.
 [Sickbay]
 (One of
the Tarkaleans is starting to regain consciousness.)
TARKALEAN: Who are you?!
PHLOX: My name is Phlox. I'm a physician. You are aboard a starship. We
responded to your distress call. (The Tarkalean sees the mottling on his hand.)
TARKALEAN: What did you do to me?
PHLOX: Your vessel was attacked. I'm doing my very best to treat you.
(to guard) I'm going to sedate him.
(But the man pushes Phlox away, then the woman jumps the guard and
knocks him out. Two tubes come out of the man's fist and into Phlox's
neck. He collapses, and the Tarkaleans leave up an access ladder.  Later, as a cacophony of voices is heard.)
ARCHER: Doctor? Phlox. (Phlox sits up.) ARCHER: What happened?
PHLOX: We were attacked. (he grabs a scanner and holds it against his
neck) I've been infected with the nanoprobes. One of the aliens
injected me, some sort of tubules.
REED: Captain. (Reed goes to the ladder.) REED: They left through here.
ARCHER: Seal off the maintenance shafts. Post teams at every access
point. When you find them, put them in Decon. Maximum security.
REED: Aye, sir.
PHLOX: Use extreme caution, Lieutenant. Their physical strength has
been enhanced. It's critical that you don't let them touch you. (checks
the guard) You haven't been infected.
GUARD: Thanks, Doctor.
ARCHER: Stay here in case there are any more problems.
GUARD: Understood.
ARCHER: Call the bridge if you need anything.
PHLOX: Actually, it's feeding time for my Edosian slugs. They're quite
partial to boiled rootleaf. I usually pick some up from the galley, but
under the circumstances.
ARCHER: I'll have it brought down. (The
Tarkaleans quickly make their way through Jefferies tubes and
maintenance walkways, looking for something in particular.)
 [Engineering]
(Looking at a schematic of the Arctic transport.)
TUCKER: They've modified most of the primary systems. Engines, hull
plating. These look like weapons nodes. I don't even want to guess what
this thing's for.
ARCHER: Doesn't look like they've enhanced the aft plating yet. If we
can punch through here, we should be able to knock out this EPS
manifold, take down their main power.
TUCKER: One or two torpedoes ought to do it.
T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
I've located the transport on long-range sensors. They're traveling at
warp four point eight.
ARCHER [OC]: How far are they?
T'POL: Less than two light years.
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER:
I need you to coax a little more power out of the engines.
TUCKER: I'll give it a shot.
ARCHER: Travis, lay in a course, warp four point nine.
TRAVIS [OC]: Aye, sir.
TUCKER: They doubled their top speed in less than twelve hours.
ARCHER: Let's hope they didn't have time to upgrade their weapons.
 [Maintenance
area]
 (The
Tarkaleans are bust pulling off panels and using their injector tubes
to modify things when Reed and his security guards turn up.)
REED: Stop what you're doing! I'll fire if I have to. (he's ignored) I
said, step away.
(Reed fires at the woman, but she just recoils and resumes what she's
doing. Combined fire just hits a personal forcefield.)
REED: Maximum setting. (They all fire again, and this time she walks
towards them, beams not touching her.) REED: Fall back.
(The male ambushes them, and tries injects one man before Reed knocks
him out with a phaser rifle.)
REED: Reed to the Bridge.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Go ahead.
REED [OC]: They're in maintenance shaft C.
 [Maintenance
area]
 REED:
Junction twelve. They appear to be modifying systems.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
What's in that junction?
T'POL: Warp plasma regulators.
ARCHER: Can you stop them?
 [Maintenance
corridor]
(Retreating rapidly.)
REED: Our weapons were useless. They're equipped with some kind of
energy shielding.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS:
Sir, our warp field's destabilising.
T'POL: It's them.
ARCHER: Isn't there an outer hatch in that junction?
T'POL: Yes.
ARCHER: Malcolm, get out of that section and seal it off.
 [Maintenance
corridor]
 REED:
Understood.
(They reach a bulkhead door and head out.)
REED: Come on, go.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Take us out of warp.
 [Jefferies
tube]
 (The
team heads down a ladder as Reed seals another hatch above them.)
REED: We're clear, Captain.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Sub-Commander.
(A hatch on the top of the port side of the saucer opens, and two
bodies fly out.)
T'POL: The junction's empty. (Archer is not happy that he's had to kill two people.)
ARCHER: Close the hatch
and re-pressurise. Malcolm, I want you to work with Trip.
 [Jefferies
tube]
 ARCHER
[OC]: Find out what they were doing in there.
REED: Aye, sir.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Resume course and speed.
T'POL: You had no choice.
 [Sickbay]
 HOSHI:
Room service. (Phlox has some mottling on his neck by the holes left by the
tubules.)
PHLOX: What's this?
HOSHI: Rootleaf lettuce for your slugs, Vulcan sandworms for the bat
and angel hair pasta for the ship's physician.
PHLOX: It's best if I avoid food for the time being.
HOSHI: You need to keep up your strength.
PHLOX: If I eat, my cellular metabolism will accelerate. The nanoprobes
could spread further.
HOSHI: Well, it's right here if you change your mind.
PHLOX: Why are you wearing a phase pistol?
HOSHI: Oh, it's Lieutenant Reed's idea. If you come near me, I'm
supposed to shoot you.
PHLOX: I hope you'll use the stun setting.
HOSHI: It's going to be a few hours before we catch up with that
transport. I'm sure that Captain Archer wouldn't mind if I stayed for a
little while, kept you company.
PHLOX: I appreciate the offer, but it may not be safe to be near me
right now.
HOSHI: I'm armed, remember? You've looked after me more times than I
can count. I want to return the favour.
PHLOX: The technology could assert itself at any moment. I don't know
what will happen if it does. I underestimated these nanoprobes once. I
don't intend to make the same mistake twice.
HOSHI: Do you mind if I feed your animals before I go?
 [Maintenance
area]
 (The
exposed circuits have a lot of green about them.)
TUCKER: They did a real number on these circuits. It could take days to
get all this junk out.
REED: What do you think they were doing here?
TUCKER: I don't know. But they almost overloaded the plasma regulators.
Doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Why blow up the ship if you're still
on it? Hand me that, will you?
REED: That shielding of theirs was impressive. We might as well have
been firing holographic bullets.
TUCKER: Too bad you didn't get a closer look. That kind of technology
could come in handy.
REED: There's got to be a way to get through those shields with phase
pistols. If I cross-polarise the power cells, it might increase the
particle yield. I'll be in the Armoury.
 [Mess
hall]
 ARCHER:
Coffee with cream. (He looks in the plate display for something to eat.)
T'POL: I believe Crewman Cunningham is in the galley if you'd like
something else.
ARCHER: This'll be fine. (Archer just takes his drink.) ARCHER: Is this seat taken?
T'POL: Please. Lieutenant Reed informed me that you plan to disable the
transport when we find it.
ARCHER: He thinks we can knock out the power systems without causing
too much damage.
T'POL: So you still intend to rescue the humans?
ARCHER: That's the general idea.
T'POL: If they've already been transformed, that could be difficult.
ARCHER: I want to take these people home, the humans and the
Tarkaleans, no matter what state they're in.
T'POL: There are twenty nine lifeforms on that transport. It's logical
to assume they've all been infected. We could endanger Enterprise if
they're brought aboard. Perhaps you should reconsider.
ARCHER: Are you saying we shouldn't go after that ship?
T'POL: I'm saying, we destroy it.
PHLOX [OC]: Phlox to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
PHLOX [OC]: Could you please come to Sickbay?
ARCHER: On my way. I'm not ready to declare them a lost cause.
 [Sickbay]
 (Phlox
is a lot more mottles, and his hand is shaking.)
ARCHER: How are you feeling?
PHLOX: Better than I anticipated. The nanoprobes seem to be having
trouble with my immune system. But they're persistent little fellows.
It won't be long before they adapt.
ARCHER: Any progress finding a treatment?
PHLOX: Possibly. I've been attempting to treat the infection as if it
were, well, an infection. Then it suddenly occurred to me, this isn't a
biological problem. I need to think like an engineer, not a physician.
I extracted several of the devices and subjected them to different
forms of radiation. Their intra-molecular processors appear to be
vulnerable to omicron particles. But if one of the nanoprobes survives,
it will start to multiply again. So I'll need to programme a rather
excessive dose. The side effects will not be pleasant, to say the
least. You may want to keep this in the event I'm unsuccessful. (He hands
over a hypospray)
ARCHER: What is it?
PHLOX: A cure of sorts. It contains a neural toxin that will terminate
my synaptic functions within a matter of seconds.
ARCHER: Aren't you jumping the gun a little?
PHLOX: I have no intention of turning into one of those cybernetic
creatures.
 [Armoury]
(Reed and Crewman Foster are test firing a phase rifle.)
REED: Increase power another five megajoules. Fire. Keep it going.
Increase to seven megajoules. Try eight. Nine. The density's holding.
Bring it up to ten. (It finally blasts a hole in the target.) REED: That
should do it. We'll reach that transport in less than an hour. Let's
modify as many of these as we can.
 [Bridge]
 (The
Arctic transport is a lot more angular now, with a green glow at the
stern.)
T'POL: The vessel's mass has increased by three percent.
REED: They've improved their defences since we last saw them.
TRAVIS: They're accelerating, warp four point nine six, nine eight
ARCHER: Increase speed.
(Enterprise starts to shake.)
TRAVIS: We're closing.
ARCHER: Target that EPS manifold.
(One phase cannon burst.)
TRAVIS: They're dropping to impulse.
HOSHI: They're sending a transmission, some kind of activation
sequence.
ARCHER: Block it!
HOSHI: I can't.
 [Maintenance
area]
 (The
Starfleet displays vanish from the monitors and are replaced with alien
ones made of roundels.)
TUCKER: Tucker to the Bridge. These cybernetic circuits just lit up
like a Christmas tree!
 [Bridge]
 (The
lights flicker.)
T'POL: They're disrupting our plasma network. Main power is failing.
REED: We're losing weapons.
ARCHER: They set us up.
HOSHI: They're hailing us. Audio only.
ARCHER: This is Captain
VOICES [OC]: You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.
(The green-tinged transport starts firing at them.)
REED: Hull plating's down eighty one percent.
ARCHER: Trip, we could use weapons.
 [Maintenance
area]
 TUCKER:
It's going to be a few minutes.
 [Bridge]
 REED:
Plating's down another twelve percent.
ARCHER: Is the transporter still on line?
REED: For the moment.
ARCHER: Then you're with me.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: I'm counting on you to pull us out of there.
 [Sickbay]
 (Phlox
is hearing voices, and is almost completely pale and mottled.)
GUARD: Doctor?
PHLOX: I've programmed the irradiation sequence, but I'll need you to
activate it once the chamber's sealed. All you have to do is press
this.
(He crawls onto the trolley which then takes him into the imaging
chamber, then the hatch closes. Inside, it looks like the radiation is
agony for him.)
 [Transporter
alcove]
(Ree hands over a phase pistol.)  REED:
I've doubled the particle yield. It may
take a few seconds to recharge after each shot.
ARCHER: Put us as close as you can to their EPS manifold.
CREWMAN: Aye, sir. (The
pair beam into a place of green lighting and electricity arcing on the Arctic transport, with lots
of strange tubing around, and regeneration alcoves.)
 [Bridge]
 (The
attack continues, and a piece of hull gets blown off.)
TRAVIS: Hull plating's at twenty three percent.
 [Arctic
transport]
 (They
find a figure standing in one of the alcoves, immobile and oblivious to
their presence, then another. Two creatures walk towards them, a male
and a smaller female. They shoot them successfully.)
ARCHER: (scanning the female) This was one of the researchers. (It was
Rooney.)
REED: Was?
ARCHER: Look at these biosigns. They're not human anymore.
(Three more come around the corner.)
REED: Sir.
(As they back away, more aliens arrive.)
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI:
We've been boarded. Six biosigns, C deck.
T'POL: Alert Security. Bridge to Commander Tucker.
 [Maintenance
area]
 TUCKER:
Go ahead.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
How much longer?
TUCKER [OC]: I think I've isolated
 [Maintenance
area]
 TUCKER:
One of the power relays. Stand by.
 [Arctic
transport]
 (They
shoot some more aliens.)
REED: Another human?
ARCHER: Same as the others.(In a corridor on Enterprise, three
security guards meet and shoot two alien boarders, but the second two
adapt their personal forcefields straight away, and are unaffected. The
Starfleet men make a strategic withdrawal.)
 [Arctic
transport]
 (Reed
is attacked by an alien, and is being choked when Archer manages to
pull one of its tubes out of it's headpiece. It writhes around on the
floor, helpless. Around the corner they find the device they are
looking for.)
ARCHER: That's it.
(Three aliens come out of their alcoves to defend it, but get shot. Reed sees the red dot of an alien eyepiece on Archer's back.)
 
REED: Captain!
(Archer turns and shoots it, then Reed sets explosives on the device.)
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS:
We've lost hull plating.
HOSHI: They're cutting into the hull. E deck, starboard forequarter.
T'POL: Evacuate that section.
 [Arctic
transport]
(Another alien comes round the corner, and Archer shoots with no
effect.)
ARCHER: They've adapted. Hurry, Malcolm! (Two more come.) ARCHER: Archer to
Enterprise. Stand by transporter.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
Acknowledged.
 [Arctic
transport]
 ARCHER:
Now.
(They are beamed out and the aliens start taking the explosives off the
device. Reed
activates the explosives from the transporter alcove, and there is a satisfying bang.)
 [Maintenance
area]
 (Tucker
takes out a control unit, and the green glow disappears.)
TUCKER: Tucker to the Bridge.
T'POL [OC]: Go ahead.
TUCKER: The alien circuits are losing power.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
Do we have weapons?
 [Maintenance
area]
 TUCKER:
They're coming online now.
(In a corridor, the four remaining aliens halt, and are beamed away in
a swirl effect.)
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Report.
T'POL: Our engines and weapons are back online. The transport's been
disabled, so has the alien circuitry. Did you find the research team?
ARCHER: There isn't anyone on that ship we can help anymore.
REED: Sir, something's happening on the transport. Their systems are
being restored. They're charging weapons.
ARCHER: Target their warp core. Hit them with everything we've got.
(Five torpedoes and a phase cannon shot blast the transport into
pieces.)
ARCHER: Get me Admiral Forrest.
Captain's Starlog, March 1, 2153. Repairs to the ship are underway, and
we've resumed our previous heading at low warp. Doctor Phlox is
confident he'll make a complete recovery.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER:
Aren't you supposed to be in bed? (Phlox is nice and pink again.)
PHLOX: I'm merely catching up on some paperwork.
Nothing too strenuous, I assure you. It's vital to keep the mind
occupied during the healing process.
ARCHER: They say doctors make the worst patients.
PHLOX: Captain, there's something you should know. I had a rather
strange experience while I was infected. I believe I was connected with
the aliens, possibly through some form of telepathy.
ARCHER: Do you think they were trying to communicate with you?
PHLOX: Not precisely. It felt as though I was part of a group
consciousness.
T'POL: You were under extraordinary physical stress. You may have
imagined it.
PHLOX: It seemed quite real. I couldn't understand most of what I was
hearing, but I got the distinct impression they were trying to send a
subspace message. They transmitted a numerical sequence. I heard it
over and over again.
(He hands over a PADD.)
 [Ready
room]
 ARCHER:
Come in. (T'Pol enters.) ARCHER: The computer analysed Phlox's numbers. They're
pulsar frequencies with geometric light year measurements.
T'POL: Spatial co-ordinates.
ARCHER: They told their homeworld how to find Earth.
T'POL: Did you learn where the message was sent?
ARCHER: Somewhere deep in the Delta Quadrant.
T'POL: Then I doubt there's any immediate danger. It would take at
least two hundred years for a subspace message to reach the Delta
Quadrant, assuming it's received at all.
ARCHER: Sounds to me like we've only postponed the invasion until what,
the twenty fourth century?

Flight
 Original Airdate: 14 May, 2003
  [Situation room]
(Looking at a sensor display on a wall monitor.)
T'POL: It could be a phantom reading, background radiation.
ARCHER: Even your scientists have confirmed the existence of dark
matter.
T'POL: But never in such dense concentration.
ARCHER: That's the point. If it really is a dark matter nebula, we'd be
the first to directly observe one.
T'POL: Even with modified sensors there wouldn't be much to see.
ARCHER: I've heard of Vulcan experiments where they were able to excite
dark matter by bombarding it with metrion particles.
T'POL: Those tests involved very small quantities. This structure is
nearly ten million kilometres in diameter.
ARCHER: (to Tucker) Could you rig some kind of spatial charges?
Something that would spread the metrion particles over a wider area?
TUCKER: If I can, it should put on a hell of a show.
HOSHI: Sorry to interrupt, Captain. It's Admiral Forrest.
ARCHER: Get to work on these charges.
TUCKER: Aye, Captain.
 [Ready
room]
 ARCHER:
This is good timing, Admiral. We just picked up some very interesting
sensor readings.
FORREST [on monitor]: I'm afraid I've got some bad news, Jon. It's AG.
He was back on Mount McKinley. There was an accident. He was killed.
I'm sorry.
 [Launch
bay]
 TUCKER:
You've got six spatial charges. I rigged them myself.
ARCHER: What are their ranges?
TUCKER: If there's any dark matter within five hundred kilometres,
you'll know it.
ARCHER: Thanks.
TUCKER: You sure you don't want some company?
ARCHER: If this nebula exists, we don't know what effect it could have
on the shuttlepod.
TUCKER: All the more reason to bring your engineer along.
ARCHER: Not this time, Trip.
TUCKER: I still can't believe it.
ARCHER: All the close calls he had flying warp trials, and he gets
killed climbing Mount McKinley.
(Archer gets into Pod One, and Tucker closes the door.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 (Archer
starts pre-flight checks, and T'Pol enters the pod with a case.)
T'POL: I've brought some sensor enhancements.
ARCHER: Thanks.
T'POL: We'll find them useful in mapping the nebula, if it's there.
ARCHER: We?
T'POL: This is a scientific mission. It's only logical to bring your
Science Officer.
ARCHER: I'd prefer to handle this myself.
T'POL: Commander Tucker obviously didn't remind you that Starfleet
regulations prohibit the Captain from leaving the ship unaccompanied.
(The shuttlepod launches.)
T'POL: We should reach the edge of the phenomenon in two hours, forty
six minutes. I can pass the time by meditating, but if you'd prefer to
talk?
ARCHER: Go ahead and meditate.
T'POL: Would you like to join me? You seem quite unsettled since your
call from Admiral Forrest.
ARCHER: I'm fine.
T'POL: Commander Tucker was reluctant to discuss it as well, though he
did mention an old colleague had died.
ARCHER: A Starfleet Captain. A. G. Robinson. I wouldn't be out here if
it weren't for him.
T'POL: I'm somewhat familiar with Starfleet history. I've never heard
of a Captain Robinson.
ARCHER: I'm sure there's a paragraph about him in the Vulcan data base.
We were in the NX test programme, trying to break the warp two barrier.
There was just a few of us. Gardner, Duvall, AG and me. We all wanted
the first flight
 [Memory
- Starfleet Command, Forrest's office]
 ARCHER
[OC}: And I was cocky enough to think I'd be the one to get it.
FORREST: Come in.
ARCHER: (our of uniform) Sorry I'm late, Commodore. I came straight
from the test bay.
FORREST: At ease, Commander. I heard your got the warp reactor up to
ninety percent today.
ARCHER: Ninety two. Sir, you didn't call me here to ask about an engine
test. We all know the assignment's about to be handed out. I'm guessing
this is either really good news or
FORREST: I'm going with Commander Robinson.
ARCHER: AG's a fine pilot.
FORREST: It wasn't an easy decision. You'll be backup.
ARCHER: Sounds good. You know I spent more time in the simulator than
anyone. If I can do anything to help AG prepare for
FORREST: Jon. It's your father's engine. I know how important this was
to you.
ARCHER: The most important thing to me is that we succeed. Is there
anything else?
FORREST: No, Commander. Dismissed.
 [602
Club]
(Archer
is sitting alone at table when the waitress brings a plate and takes
his empties.)
 ARCHER:
Thanks, Ruby.
RUBY: You all right?
ARCHER: Sure, why?
RUBY: The last time you had this much to drink was the day Caroline
moved to New Berlin. My guess is Forrest gave out the assignment today.
ARCHER: Sherlock Holmes has nothing on you.
RUBY: They'll need a pilot for the next flight.
ARCHER: Do you remember what Buzz Aldrin said when he stepped on the
moon?
RUBY: No.
ARCHER: Nobody does, because Armstrong went first.
(He goes over to a group at the bar.)
ARCHER: Congratulations.
(They shakes hands.)
ROBINSON: You mean that?
ARCHER: Of course not. I'm waiting for Forrest to realise what a
horrible mistake he made. Until then, let me buy you a drink.
ROBINSON: No, I'll buy you one. Consolation prize. Two more, Leo.
LEO: Here you go.
ARCHER: To Commander A. G. Robinson. We all worked hard to get this
flight, but in the end the best pilot won. Just ask him. AG.
ALL: AG.
ARCHER: Take it easy Commander, you're due in the simulator at oh seven
hundred. First flight's in two weeks.
ROBINSON: You know why you didn't get this assignment?
ARCHER: I bet you're going to tell me.
ROBINSON: You tried too hard. You did everything by the book. You
burned the midnight oil in that simulator, eighteen, twenty hour days.
You shut everything and everyone out of your life just so you could be
the first.
ARCHER: And?
ROBINSON: You still don't understand. Starfleet doesn't just want a
great pilot. They want a great captain.
 [Shuttlepod]
 T'POL:
You said Captain Robinson was a close friend.
ARCHER: That's right.
T'POL: From what you've told me, your relationship seemed adversarial.
ARCHER: Only one of us was going to get to fly that ship. Nothing wrong
with a little healthy competition.
T'POL: He did have a point. It does take more than piloting ability to
command a starship.
ARCHER: I agree.
T'POL: Fortunately, you seem to have developed the necessary skills.
ARCHER: Was that a compliment?
T'POL: An observation. I assume Captain Robinson's flight was
successful?
ARCHER: Not exactly. He was lucky to come out of it in one piece.
 [Memory
- NX Control room]
 (There
is an audience of Vulcans, and Commodore Forrest.)
ROBINSON [OC]: NX control. I thought we built a warp ship so we could
go to warp.
ARCHER: Maintain your orbit. We're trying to run down a problem with
the stabilisation protocols.
ROBINSON [OC]: I saw Italy go by again. If this is going to take much
longer, maybe you can send up some food.
ARCHER: What can I get you?
 [NX
Alpha]
ROBINSON: How about some of those deep fried mushrooms from the 602?
 [NX
Control room]
 ARCHER:
I'll send Ruby up to take your order.
FLIGHT: We are clear on the stabilisation protocols. Restart countdown
at thirty seconds.
ARCHER: Good news AG. I just got word from the powers that be that
you're good to go.
 [NX
Alpha]
ROBINSON: Acknowledged. WSP is nominal. APU's are good.
 [NX
Control room]
 ARCHER:
Warp field initialisation in twenty seconds.
 [NX
Alpha]
ROBINSON: I'm breaking orbit. At least the thrusters work. I did get a
little variance on the RCS.
 [NX
Control room]
(Archer
checks the large wall display of NX-A.)
 ARCHER:
We noticed that here. Do you want to bring her back to the garage?
 [NX
Alpha]
ROBINSON: Not on your life.
 [NX
Control room]
 FLIGHT:
We've got an stable warp field.
ARCHER: NX control to NX Alpha. You have my permission to go to warp.
 [NX
Alpha]
ROBINSON: See you in a few light years.
 [NX
Control room]
 ARCHER:
Warp one. One point five. That little bump you just felt was warp two.
Congratulations. Now let's see if you can get it up to two point one.
 [NX
Alpha]
ROBINSON: She's getting a little shaky.
 [NX
Control room]
ROBINSON [OC]: Are you sure you've got that stabilisation problem
ironed out?
FLIGHT: Field integrity's down to twenty percent.
VULCAN: The warp field won't hold.
ARCHER: AG, we're getting some pretty unusual telemetry down here. We
need you to go sublight until we get this sorted out.
(An alarm sounds.)
 [NX
Alpha]
 ARCHER
[OC]: Did you hear me?
ROBINSON: I'm at two point one. I think I can get more out of her.
ARCHER [OC]: Negative. Abort!
 [NX
Control room]
 ARCHER:
Warp two point one five.
FORREST: This is Forrest. Drop to impulse, that's an order!
ARCHER: Two point two.
 [NX
Alpha]
ROBINSON: The field's collapsing!
ARCHER [OC]: AG, you've got to get out of there.
(NX Alpha drops out of warp near Jupiter and explodes.)
 [NX
Control room]
 FLIGHT:
We've lost telemetry.
ARCHER: NX Control to NX Alpha, come in. AG, can you hear me?
 [Shuttlepod]
 T'POL:
Particle density is increasing.
ARCHER: We should be entering the nebula.
T'POL: The readings could be misleading.
ARCHER: As Doctor Phlox would say, optimism.
T'POL: Optimism doesn't alter the law of physics.
ARCHER: Time to put Trip's charges to the test. Three seconds.
(Two charges explode, making purple patterns.)
ARCHER: Anything?
(She checks the sensor display in her case, and shakes her head.)
ARCHER: We need to move deeper into the nebula, if it exists.
T'POL: What happened?
ARCHER: The field emissions on the charges could have been too low, or
maybe we're just on a wild goose chase.
T'POL: I was referring to Captain Robinson. His test flight.
ARCHER: He made the record books for being the first person to deploy
an escape pod at warp, but he lost one of two NX prototypes. Nearly
derailed the entire programme.
[Memory - NX Hanger]
 ARCHER:
Are you all right?
ROBINSON: A little shaky. Trust me, you don't want to pass through the
warp barrier in one of those. Should make a nice addition to the
Starfleet Museum.
FORREST: What went wrong?
ROBINSON: I'm not sure, sir. The closer I got to two point two, the
more trouble I had keeping the field stable.
ARCHER: You where ordered to abort.
ROBINSON: The abort call was premature. We had some instability on the
previous tests, but it always settled down.
VULCAN: Your engine design is obviously unsound.
(Tucker comes down some steps.)
 TUCKER:
There's nothing wrong with that engine.
FORREST: You have something to add, Lieutenant?
TUCKER: Tucker, sir. I'm on Captain Jefferies' Engineering team. We've
never pumped this much antimatter through the injectors before. It's
going to take us a little time to get the intermix right.
VULCAN: That's precisely the point. Your programme is moving too
quickly.
TUCKER: Just because it took you a hundred years to crack warp two
doesn't mean it'll take us that long.
FORREST: Lieutenant!
TUCKER: Sorry, sir.
ARCHER: He's right. This is a new engine. It's bound to have a few bugs
to work out.
VULCAN: Those bugs just scattered your ship across five thousand
kilometres of space, and nearly killed your pilot.
ROBINSON: We're not going to get anywhere without taking some risks.
FORREST: I know where you stand on this, Commander.
ARCHER: We've got a lot of data to analyse before we know what
happened. We should be grateful we only lost the ship.
 [602
club]
 TUCKER:
Cyrus.
(Ruby
delivers beers to their table.)
 RUBY:
Cyrus.
ARCHER: Who's Cyrus?
TUCKER: It was my great grandfather's name.
RUBY: Keep trying, Tucker.
TUCKER: Chester. How about Rosalie if it's a girl? Come on, give me a
hint.
(Ruby leaves them.)
TUCKER: She's had names for her kids picked out since she was ten. Says
she'll marry the first man to guess them.
ARCHER: What's your name, Lieutenant?
TUCKER: Charles Tucker, sir, but everyone calls me Trip.
ARCHER: Trip?
TUCKER: My dad's Charles Tucker, and so was his dad. That makes me the
third, so triple. Trip.
ARCHER: Thanks with your help today with our Vulcan friends, Trip. My
father would have appreciated it.
TUCKER: I don't get it. It's like they want us to fail.
FORREST: I gave up trying to figure out the Vulcans a long time ago.
(The pair stand.)
ARCHER: Commodore.
FORREST: At ease. May I?
ARCHER: Of course. (all sit)
TUCKER: Can I buy you a drink, sir?
FORREST: It's the least you can do after that outburst today.
TUCKER: I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean to
FORREST: I'll have a beer, Mister Tucker.
(He unzips his jacket and loosens his tie.)
FORREST: It's been a while since I've been in here. I see it hasn't
changed much.
ARCHER: Is there something on your mind, Sir?
FORREST: I came here to tell you at the urging of the Vulcan Advisory
Council, that Starfleet Command has decided to put the NX programme on
hold.
ARCHER: For how long?
FORREST: Indefinitely.
RUBY: Gentlemen?
TUCKER: One beer.
ARCHER: What do you mean, indefinitely?
FORREST: They want to go back to the drawing board, Jon. Develop a new
engine from scratch.
ARCHER: We have an engine that works now. If we start over, it'll be
decades before we get into deep space.
FORREST: Starfleet's made its decision.
TUCKER: Permission to speak freely, sir? It's your father's engine. His
life's work. You can't let them do this.
(Later, Forrest has left and it's raining outside, but the pair are
still drinking. Robinson
comes in and hanging up his traditional leather flight jacket.)
ROBINSON: Bourbon, straight up.
ARCHER: I suppose you heard.
ROBINSON: This is really going to throw a wrench in my career plans.
(Ruby delivers glass.)
ROBINSON: Thanks.
RUBY: Last call. Anything else?
ROBINSON: I'll have another.
ARCHER: Where have you been all day?
ROBINSON: Debriefing. After the flight surgeons were done with me I got
hauled in front of the Starfleet senior staff and the Vulcans.
TUCKER: What'd you tell them?
ROBINSON: What do you think? The subspace field destabilised at warp
two point two. Primary flight controls failed, resulting in the loss of
the vehicle.
TUCKER: Aren't you forgetting something?
ROBINSON: What?
TUCKER: The possibility of pilot error.
ROBINSON: I'm not interested in your opinion, Lieutenant.
ARCHER: You should be. The Vulcans have been leaning on Starfleet for
years to rein in this programme. You walked in there today, ruled out
pilot error, and told them just what they wanted to hear. Our engine
doesn't work.
ROBINSON: Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, Archer, but it doesn't
work.
TUCKER: The engine's sound. We just need more time to balance the
intermix.
ROBINSON: We need more than time.
ARCHER: I agree. We need a pilot who listens to orders. If you aborted,
we'd still have a ship and probably another chance.
ROBINSON: Another chance to what, get killed?
ARCHER: At the first sign of trouble, you should've throttled down.
ROBINSON: It wouldn't have made a damn bit of difference.
ARCHER: I guess we'll never find out.
ROBINSON: You weren't in that cockpit.
ARCHER: There's nothing wrong with that ship!
ROBINSON: There's plenty wrong. You just refuse to see it.
ARCHER: What the hell's that supposed to mean?
ROBINSON: Every time there's a problem with this project, you blame it
on pilot error or gravitational anomalies, or some technical
malfunction. Well, you're going to have to face the truth this time,
because there's nothing left to point an finger at. Your father
designed a lousy engine.
(This starts a fist fight.)
RUBY: That's enough! (to Tucker) Do something!
TUCKER: Come on, come on, break it up.
(Tucker restrains Archer while two other guys get Robinson.)
TUCKER: Break it up!
RUBY: Do you think this is going to get either of you any closer to
warp five?
 [Shuttlepod]
 T'POL:
The fight was interrupted?
ARCHER: Not before I got two bruised ribs and a cracked molar.
T'POL: I suppose we'll never know. Who would have won.
(An alarm sounds.)
T'POL: Main power is fluctuating.
ARCHER: It's all right. Auxiliary's kicking in.
T'POL: There was a surge in the EPS grid.
ARCHER: We must be getting close. Trip said the dark matter might
affect the shuttle's systems. He'll be happy to hear he was right.
T'POL: It was probably nothing more than a simple malfunction.
ARCHER: I don't think so. Our pre-launch checks were all fine.
Something else caused that surge.
T'POL: I'm not detecting any dark matter.
ARCHER: Have a little faith, T'Pol.
T'POL: Even if you're right, it may be dangerous to proceed. Another
surge could disable life support.
ARCHER: One thing I learned from AG. You're never going to get anywhere
without taking risks.
T'POL: You obviously admired this man.
ARCHER: Quite a bit.
T'POL: And yet he cracked your molar.
ARCHER: Humans can have funny ways of forming friendships.
T'POL: To say the least.
ARCHER: He would have loved it out here. Too bad he never got the
chance. God knows he earned it.
T'POL: I thought you said he was responsible for nearly ending the
programme.
ARCHER: He was also responsible for getting it back on course, with a
little help from me and Trip.
 [Memory
- NX Locker room]
 (AG is
clearing out his locker.)
ARCHER: I see you're not losing any time.
ROBINSON: We're done flying. No use hanging around. Here you go.
(pushes a trunk at Archer)
ARCHER: I'm not clearing out just yet.
ROBINSON: Suit yourself.
ARCHER: I've been thinking about what you were saying last night about
my father's engine.
ROBINSON: Look, I was out of line.
ARCHER: You were right. I wanted to see this thing fly so badly, it
kept me from being objective.
ROBINSON: That's good of you to admit, but it doesn't really matter
now.
ARCHER: It may. I got my hands on the telemetry from your flight. It
looks like Tucker was right about the intermix, but I think we can
compensate for it.
ROBINSON: You heard Forrest. The programme is on hold indefinitely.
ARCHER: We can take this to Starfleet, make a case to get off the
ground again.
ROBINSON: What about the Vulcans? They'll look at your data and say we
need to run computer simulations for another ten years to prove that
you're right.
ARCHER: Commodore Forrest will back us up.
ROBINSON: Forrest answers to Starfleet Command. It's out of his hands.
ARCHER: Even if his two senior pilots insist that this ship can fly? If
the three of us go in there together, we might be able to change their
minds. You just went faster than any human being ever has and now your
going to walk away? Let them put the ship in mothballs when we're so
close to breaking warp three? You're always talking about taking risks.
What have we got to lose?
ROBINSON: If you want to convince the Vulcans, you'll have to do a lot
better than showing them a bunch of antimatter calculations.
ARCHER: I'm open to suggestions.
ROBINSON: We only lost one ship. Still have one left.
ARCHER: They'll never give us clearance.
ROBINSON: Can you think of a better way to prove it'll fly? You want to
talk about taking risks? You're a great pilot, maybe as good as me, but
you're never going to get out into deep space by playing it safe. When
the first warp five starship is built, it's Captain won't be able to
call home every time he needs to make a decision. He won't be able to
turn to the Vulcans, unless he decides to take one with him.
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER:
We should be twenty thousand kilometres inside the nebula. Let's load
up two more charges.
T'POL: The history of your early warp flights is well-documented, but
I've never read anything about two Starfleet pilots stealing the warp
three prototype.
ARCHER: It wasn't the kind of thing Starfleet Command wanted to
advertise. Don't you believe me?
T'POL: I have no doubt it happened, though I find it difficult to
believe you had to be convinced to participate.
ARCHER: Well, you didn't know me then. I was a little more by-the-book.
T'POL: The particle density has nearly doubled. Shall we try again?
(two more bangs still only make a little purple glow) Perhaps we should
head back.
ARCHER: We still have two more charges. Let's keep looking.
T'POL: Was your test flight successful?
ARCHER: Promise you won't put this into the Vulcan database?
 [Memory
- NX Hangar, night]
 ARCHER
[OC]: We decided on a night launch.
TUCKER: I've routed the intermix controls to the engineering station.
If it becomes unstable, you'll be able to adjust it manually.
ARCHER: Thanks.
TUCKER: If I came along, I could monitor the antimatter flow.
ARCHER: I'll keep an eye on it.
TUCKER: You're going to have your hands full.
ARCHER: We need you down here. Don't worry, you'll get out there
someday. If I had my own ship I'd sign you up in a second.
TUCKER: I'm going to hold you to it.
(They shake on it.)
ARCHER: Thanks, Trip.
 [NX
Beta]
 ARCHER:
No response from the auxiliary APU's.
ROBINSON: That's because they haven't been installed yet.
ARCHER: How's it coming, Trip?
TUCKER [OC]: I've disabled
 [NX
Hangar]
 TUCKER:
The tracking sensors but I'll need a minute to divert the telemetry.
ARCHER [OC]: How long?
TUCKER: Don't wait for me. I'll be ready by the time you break orbit.
 [NX
Beta]
 ARCHER:
Acknowledged.
(The hangar doors rumble open.)
ROBINSON: Not to late to call this off, head over to the 602 for a
beer.
ARCHER: Not on your life.
(The ship goes past Tucker and his monitor as it leaves hangar and then
hurtles up the launch ramp.)
ARCHER: Anyone noticed we're gone yet?
TUCKER [OC]: No, as far as they know the doors are closed and the
lights are out.
 [NX
Hangar]
 TUCKER:
But New Berlin should be picking you up in about six minutes.
 [NX
Beta]
ROBINSON: By the time they figure out what's going on, we'll be half
way to Jupiter.
 [Forrest's
office]
FORREST: Come in. You're working late.
FLIGHT: We just got a call. New Berlin's detected the NX Beta.
FORREST: What?
FLIGHT: Internal sensors show it's still in the hangar.
FORREST: Has anyone bothered to look?
 [NX
Beta]
 ARCHER:
Warp field is stable.
(Robinson releases his seat harness.)
ARCHER: Something wrong?
ROBINSON: Why don't you take it?
ARCHER: What?
ROBINSON: I had the last flight. You're due up.
(They swap seats.)
ROBINSON: Besides, you could use the practice. I hope you and Tucker
were right about that intermix.
ARCHER: We're about to find out.
FORREST [OC]: This is Forrest.
 [NX
Control room]
FORREST: What the hell is going on?
ARCHER [OC]: Just running an engine test, sir.
FORREST: Archer? Turn around right now, and I'll do what I can
 [NX
Beta]
FORREST: To keep you out of prison. If you
(Robinson cuts him off)
 [NX
Control room]
FORREST: Archer!
(The two Vulcans enter.)
FORREST: Perfect.
 [NX
Beta]
ROBINSON: That's warp two.
 [NX
Hangar]
 TUCKER:
Here we go again. I'm reading fluctuations in the intermix.
ARCHER [OC]: We see it.
(AG makes manual adjustments in the NX-B, but it just gets worse.)
TUCKER: Your warp field's destabilising.
 [NX
Beta]
(Archer
is fighting the controls.)
ARCHER: Warp two point one five. (to AG) You'd better get that
intermix locked down because I'm not backing off till I break your
record. Got it?
ROBINSON: Almost.
 [NX
Hangar]
SECURITY: Come with us, Lieutenant.
TUCKER: NX Beta, do you read?
 [NX
Control room]
 ARCHER
[OC]: NX Beta to Commodore Forrest. You might want to check your
sensors. You'll see that we're holding steady at two point five.
(Tucker is delighted)
FORREST: Congratulations. Now get the hell back here.
 [Forrest's
office]
FORREST: Not only was it in violation of a direct order, it was utterly
reckless, irresponsible and maybe even criminal.
ROBINSON: Sir.
FORREST: I'm not done, Commander! You are both suspended from duty
pending an inquiry, and by the time Starfleet Command gets through with
you, you're going to wish that you had never come back. You're supposed
to represent the best that Starfleet has to offer. Keeping this
programme on track is hard enough without our own officers undermining
it. What did you think that this stunt of yours would accomplish? That
just because you didn't get yourselves killed that we'd ignore that
data we've collected, the testing we've done, the recommendations of
the Vulcan Advisory Council?
ROBINSON: If we follow all their recommendations, we'll never make it
into deep space.
VULCAN: No one is suggesting that your warp programme be dismantled,
only that Starfleet proceed with more restraint.
ROBINSON: Get Lieutenant Tucker in here. Ask any engineer on the
project. They'll tell you this ship can fly. Archer and I just proved
it. We're ready to go. Now.
VULCAN: That's not you decision to make.
ARCHER: With all due respect, its not your's either. You're right, sir.
We were reckless. We knew there'd be consequences. We knew we'd
probably be thrown out of Starfleet.
FORREST: You may have been right.
ARCHER: AG and I may never fly again, but its a small sacrifice to make
if it keeps this project going. We didn't build this engine to make
test runs around Jupiter. We built it to explore. If my father were
alive today, he'd be standing here asking, what the hell are we waiting
for?
 [Shuttlepod]
 T'POL:
You obviously weren't dismissed from Starfleet. They must have found
your argument convincing.
ARCHER: Convincing enough. We managed to avoid a court martial, but
they grounded us for three months.
T'POL: Still, the NX programme continued.
ARCHER: Eventually. The Vulcans had us run every simulation they could
think of for over a year before they finally admitted the engine would
probably work. Eight months after that, Duvall broke warp three in the
NX Delta. Five years later we laid the keel for Enterprise. You know
the rest.
T'POL: The particle density has increased again.
ARCHER: I'd hate to see those last two charges go to waste. (they fire,
and detonate) Anything on sensors?
T'POL: It appears so. (the area gradually lights up with ribbons of
pinky purple) Fascinating. This data will certainly cause a debate at
the Science Directorate.
ARCHER: T'Pol, come up and look at this a minute.
T'POL: I have to monitor the quantum field.
ARCHER: Let the sensors do it. That's why AG and I worked so hard to
get out here.
T'POL: Captain Robinson clearly wanted to command Enterprise as much as
you did.
ARCHER: He wasn't alone, but by the end AG and I were the only two
candidates left. They made the final selection six months before we
launched. Maybe I just got lucky.
 [Memory
- 602 Club]
 ARCHER:
Thanks.
RUBY: Congratulations, Captain.
ROBINSON: To Jonathan Archer, first skipper of the Starship Enterprise,
(he takes a drink) and one lucky s.o.b.
ARCHER: Luck had nothing to do with it.
ROBINSON: It couldn't have been talent. I'm just waiting for Forrest to
realise what a horrible mistake he made. Still, they could have done a
lot worst. Anyway, I'd rather wait for the NX02. Let you make all the
mistakes so I'll have an easier time of it.
ARCHER: To the first skipper of the NX02.
ROBINSON: Got to go. I'm catching a shuttle to Alice Springs at oh six
hundred. More survival training. Night, Ruby. Good luck, Jon. Hey, I'll
see you out there.
 [Shuttlepod]
 T'POL:
Captain. We should start back if we're going to make our rendezvous.
ARCHER: Right.
 [Launch
Bay]
 TUCKER:
Welcome back. How'd it go?
T'POL: Your charges were effective.
TUCKER: Was it a good show?
ARCHER: You should've been there.
TUCKER: I'll remember to ask you next time.
(Tucker leaves.)
T'POL: I believe there's a human custom that says when you discover
something of merit, you earn the right to name it.
ARCHER: What would you suggest? The T'Pol - Archer nebula?
T'POL: I was thinking the Robinson nebula would be more appropriate.

Bounty
 Mission date: Mar 21, 2153
Original Airdate: 14 May, 2003
  Captain's Starlog, March 21st, 2153. After three
days exploring an uninhabited planet, Commander Tucker and I have been
called back to Enterprise to greet an unexpected visitor.
 [Turbolift]
 ARCHER:
Maybe you were light-headed from the altitude. 
TUCKER: I didn't slip. That overhang gave way the moment I put my foot
on it. 
ARCHER: I walked on the same rocks you did. 
TUCKER: Maybe you loosened them. You do weigh a few kilos more than I
do.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Report. 
REED: It dropped out of warp thirty minutes ago. The pilot sent a brief
audio message. He insisted on speaking with you right away. 
ARCHER: Any idea what he wants? 
REED: He wouldn't say, but I did manage to find his ship design in the
Vulcan database. It's Tellarite. 
ARCHER: T'Pol's mentioned them. Open a channel. This is Jonathan Archer
of the Enterprise. What can I do for you? (A Tellarite has small eyes, tusk-like lower incisor teeth,
more of a snout than a nose.) 
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: You can start by telling me what you're
doing here. 
ARCHER: I didn't get your name. 
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: Captain Skalaar of the Tellarite Mining
Consortium. 
ARCHER: We're studying this planet. I have three science teams on the
surface. We're also here for a little shore leave. 
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: Shore leave? 
ARCHER: Vacation. It's been a while since we've had a chance to relax. 
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: In that case, I recommend you visit the
equatorial range. The view from the north summit is inspiring. 
ARCHER: You've been here before? 
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: Many times. I prefer to think of it as my own
personal retreat. You mustn't leave until you've experienced the
hydrothermal pools of Ren-gham. 
ARCHER: Where are they? 
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: The polar island chain, two hundred and twenty
seven kilometres from the southern tip of the Rykos shoreline. Look for
the pyroclastic debris field then follow the lava tubes 
TUCKER: Sounds like we could use a guide. 
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: I'd be happy to show you. 
ARCHER: Sure we're not intruding? 
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: Not at all. I'll meet you at your starboard
docking port. I'll help you plan your shore leave.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER:
T'Pol says they're not the most agreeable species. Apparently they
enjoy a good argument. It's considered a sport on their planet. 
TUCKER: I've got an old girlfriend this guy might like to meet. (He opens the airlock and Skalaar shoots him. Archer struggles for the weapon and gets
shot himself. Skalaar closes the airlock taking Archer with him.)
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI:
I'm picking up weapons fire on E deck, the starboard airlock. 
REED: Send a security team. Bridge to Captain Archer. (Enterprise shudders.) 
TRAVIS: The Tellarite ship's trying to undock
with the seals locked. 
REED: Engage the emergency clamps. (The little ship gets away and
shoots at the starboard nacelle.) 
TRAVIS: He's going to warp. 
REED: Pursuit course. 
TRAVIS: He's disabled our starboard nacelle. We can't follow him, sir. 
REED: Get those teams up from the surface. (The shuttlepod returns.)
 [Sickbay]
 TUCKER
[OC]: We're having trouble isolating his signature. There must have
been something masking it. 
T'POL: How long until we have warp drive.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER:
Less than an hour. 
T'POL [OC]: I'm on my way to the Bridge. 
TUCKER: Acknowledged.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX:
I'm afraid you're not going anywhere for the moment. We brought a
stowaway with us, an unusual microbe. 
T'POL: Is it contagious? 
PHLOX: I'll have to run some more tests. To be safe, we should both go
through Decon.
 [Skalaar's
ship]
 (Archer
wakes up behind bright yellow 'bars.')
ARCHER: What do you want? I asked you a question. (He touches a bar and gets
a shock.)
SKALAAR: I'd stay clear of those emitters if I were you. The very
latest technology. I installed them last month. 
ARCHER: I doubt this ship of yours will be a match for Enterprise. 
SKALAAR: I've taken appropriate counter-measures. We won't be seeing
any more of your starship. 
ARCHER: I want to know where you're taking me. My crew's not going to
give up until they find me. If you take me back, I'd be willing to
forget this ever happened. (Skalaar points his weapon at him.) 
SKALAAR: You can either be quiet or spend
the rest of this trip unconscious. Which do you prefer? 
(Archer sits down quietly)
 [Decon
chamber]
 (The
pair are in their underwear.) PHLOX: This microbe is more resilient than
I thought. It doesn't seem to be vulnerable to theta radiation. 
T'POL: Perhaps you can increase the dosage. 
PHLOX: That wouldn't be advisable. We'd both suffer permanent cellular
damage. 
T'POL: There must be something else you can try. 
PHLOX: Decon gel E may neutralise the microbe, but it will be several
hours before we know if it's effective. 
T'POL: I can't stay here several hours. 
PHLOX: You have little choice. This organism appears to be infectious
and humans would be far more vulnerable to it than you or I. Commander
Tucker is quite capable. If he needs your help, he knows where to find
you. (He draws a curtain between them before disrobing to apply the gel.)
PHLOX: Fortunately no one else on the surface was exposed to the microbe. I
suspect you and I were contaminated when we climbed into the second
ravine. Considering the quantity of fauna down there, I'm not at all
surprised. We were probably infected by the marsupials I found. 
T'POL: I told you to leave them alone. 
PHLOX: Their saliva is a natural anti-coagulant. I couldn't return to
the ship without a sample. I could use your assistance. (T'Pol pulls the
curtain back to apply the gel to his prominent ridged spine.) 
T'POL: I wasn't aware a curtain was installed. 
PHLOX: Not everyone is comfortable with the idea of disrobing in front
of others. 
T'POL: An odd attitude for a physician. 
PHLOX: It's a characteristic of Denobulan males. We're more inhibited
than our women. It's led to a number of awkward moments. My Starfleet
physical was an experience I never hope to repeat. (T'Pol is fascinated
by his spinal ridges.) 
T'POL: If you wouldn't mind. (She pulls up her vest, and he returns the
favour without actually looking at her.)
 [Bridge]
 REED:
Sensors are picking up a faint warp signature. 
TUCKER: Can you get a fix on it? 
REED: Bearing oh seven one mark three two. It's erratic, but it matches
our Tellarite friend. 
TUCKER: Set a course, maximum warp.
 [Skalaar's
ship]
 KLINGON
[OC]: You are speaking on a secure channel. 
SKALAAR: I'm trying to reach Captain Goroth. It's very important that I
speak with him. 
KLINGON [OC]: We're attempting to transfer you. Stand by. 
GOROTH [OC]: This is Goroth. What do you want? 
SKALAAR: I have the fugitive. 
GOROTH [OC]: He's in your custody? 
SKALAAR: He's standing about five metres from me. You'll be pleased to
know he's still alive. I'm bringing him to Kronos as we agreed. 
GOROTH [OC]: No. I'm transmitting rendezvous co-ordinates. Be there in
two days. 
SKALAAR: I trust you'll have the full payment? 
GOROTH [OC]: You'll get what was promised. 
SKALAAR: A pleasure doing business with you, Captain. (Ends
transmission.) SKALAAR: As always. 
ARCHER: How much are they paying you? You mentioned the Klingon
homeworld, Kronos. I assume this has something to do with my escaping
prison. You don't even know what I'm accused of. 
SKALAAR: You're right, and I don't care to.
 [Bridge]
 REED:
The signature's holding steady. Looks like he's orbiting a G-type star.

TUCKER: Go to Tactical Alert. 
(But as they approach, we can see it's not a ship.) 
REED: It appears to be a beacon of some kind. It's generating a warp
signature identical to the Tellarites. 
TUCKER: A decoy! Anything on sensors? (Reed shakes his head.) TUCKER: We're
going to have to start all over. 
REED: I'm getting too much interference from that device. It's throwing
off our scans. 
TUCKER: Then get rid of it. 
REED: With pleasure, sir. (He phasers it into atoms.)
 [Skalaar's
ship]
 (It's
meal time, and Skalaar is serving up something from a pan on a stove.)
ARCHER: I have no idea what the Klingons are paying you, but whatever
it is, Starfleet will double it. 
SKALAAR: I don't take bribes from criminals. 
ARCHER: I'm not a criminal. 
SKALAAR: Klingon Judiciary says you are. 
ARCHER: My crime was helping a ship full of refugees. 
SKALAAR: Oh, that was very noble of you. You'll think twice before
doing that again. (Skalaar sits down to eat.) 
ARCHER: It's pretty clear I'm never going to get the chance. I was
sentenced to life in prison on Rura Penthe. Ever heard of it? 
SKALAAR: I'm familiar with Rura Penthe. 
ARCHER: The magistrate isn't going to be so lenient next time. I'll
probably be executed. (Skalaar loses his appetite.) 
SKALAAR: That's not my concern. 
ARCHER: You don't care that you're sending an innocent man to his
death. 
SKALAAR: I've captured dozens of fugitives. Every one of them claimed
to be an innocent man. 
ARCHER: If the Klingons wanted them, they probably were. You don't have
to do this. 
SKALAAR: Goroth already knows you're aboard. If I don't deliver you
he'll offer a reward for both of us. I've learned never to cross a
Klingon. 
ARCHER: It must be difficult working for people like them. 
SKALAAR: I don't answer to those savages. I work for myself. 
ARCHER: That's not how it looks from in here. 
SKALAAR: If you knew how much they were paying me you'd understand.
This has nothing to do with you. I'm sure you're not a bad person, just
an unlucky one.
 [Decon
chamber]
 T'POL:
You're making it difficult to meditate. 
PHLOX: (scanning her) You've developed a slight fever. I'm also reading
elevated dopamine levels. The microbe may be affecting your limbic
system. 
T'POL: I can't concentrate under these conditions. 
PHLOX: I don't mean to be intrusive. (T'Pol stands and paces.) 
T'POL: The Captain's been abducted, he may even be
dead. My place is on the Bridge. 
(She exits via the locker room, but Phlox gets to the main exit before
her and locks it.) 
PHLOX: Sub-Commander, where are you going? 
T'POL: Open it. 
PHLOX: You'll spread the infection. 
T'POL: I'll go to my quarters. If I seal off the ventilation system it
should minimise the risk of exposing anyone. 
PHLOX: Your quarters are on C deck. By the time you reach them you'll
contaminate half the ship. 
T'POL: Unlock this door. I gave you a direct order. 
PHLOX: I'm sorry, but I can't obey it. 
T'POL: I can have you court-martialed. 
PHLOX: I doubt that very 
T'POL: Open it! I apologise. I'm having trouble suppressing my
emotions. 
PHLOX: We'll know in a few hours whether the gel is working. Until
then, perhaps a mild sedative will help?
 [Skalaar's
ship]
(Skalaar is speaking to another Tellarite.)SKALAAR: The Klingons are paying nine thousand darseks. That's more
than enough to get Tezra back. 
GAAVRIN [on monitor]: You're not being realistic. 
SKALAAR: I already have the human in custody. The reward is guaranteed.

GAAVRIN [on monitor]: You've made this promise before. 
SKALAAR: In two days you'll see I'm telling the truth. 
GAAVRIN [on monitor]: Even if you get the money, which I doubt, it
wouldn't change my decision. 
SKALAAR: Do you want to scrub plasma injectors the rest of your life?
I'm giving you a chance to (Signal ends.)
ARCHER: Who's Tezra? 
SKALAAR: Tezra's not a person, it's a cargo ship. Far more impressive
than this antique. 
ARCHER: You're going to use the reward to buy your ship back? 
SKALAAR: You'd be wise to keep quiet. The Klingons pay me the same
whether you're alive or dead. A vessel's approaching. I wouldn't get
too optimistic. It's not your starship. (Another alien makes contact with Skalaar. This one has its chin tucked in and a ridged skull with two plumes of fine
hair hanging down.)
KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]: You have something I want. 
SKALAAR: Always one step behind me, eh, Kago? 
KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]: Drop out of warp and surrender the prisoner. 
SKALAAR: Why would I do that? 
KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]: Don't force me to take action. 
SKALAAR: Goroth told you where I was, didn't he. 
KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]: You had two months to find the human. Goroth
contacted me because you obviously weren't going to succeed. You're
incompetent! 
SKALAAR: If I was incompetent Archer would be aboard your ship,
wouldn't he? 
KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]: The human. Now. 
SKALAAR: Or what, you'll destroy my shuttle? Can't collect on Archer if
he's a cloud of vapour. (He breaks contact.) SKALAAR: You may want to hold on to
something. (Kago-Darr starts firing at them, and Skalaar returns fire.) 
ARCHER: Let me out. I can help you. 
SKALAAR: You must think I'm a fool. 
ARCHER: You can't manoeuvre the ship and make repairs at the same time.
I'm a pilot, let me take the helm. 
SKALAAR: If you try to escape. (Skalaar lets him out.) SKALARR: This is the warp field
regulator, the impulse throttle. 
ARCHER: Navigation sensors. 
SKALAAR: There. 
ARCHER: There's an L class planet in this system. I'm taking us out of
warp. 
SKALAAR: What? 
ARCHER: We can't outrun him but he may not be able to navigate as well
as we can in the planet's atmosphere. 
(They go down into the atmosphere.) 
SKALAAR: This ship wasn't designed for these manoeuvres. We've lost the
aft cannons. 
ARCHER: What about forward cannons? 
SKALAAR: Still online. 
ARCHER: What are these? 
SKALAAR: Subspace beacons. They generate a false warp signature. I used
one of them to evade your vessel. 
ARCHER: Get ready to launch them. 
SKALAAR: What good will that do? 
ARCHER: He's flying on sensors, just like we are. He'll only have a one
in three chance of targeting us. 
SKALAAR: Ready. 
ARCHER: Now. (The strategy succeeds and Archer comes up behind Kago-Darr's
ship to fire at him.) ARCHER: We knocked out his engine. He's making an
emergency landing. 
SKALAAR: Don't celebrate yet. Our reactor's leaking. The warp drive's
offline. I'm never going to make the rendezvous. 
ARCHER: Isn't that a shame. 
SKALAAR: The reactor also powers life support. 
ARCHER: Then you'd better get to work. 
SKALAAR: It can only be accessed from the outer hull. 
ARCHER: Then we should set down here. 
SKALAAR: But Kago's on the surface. 
ARCHER: We'll land a thousand kilometres away.
 [Decon
chamber]
(Phlox is woken by T'Pol's hand on his neck.)  PHLOX:
What are you doing? 
T'POL: You said we'd need another treatment. 
PHLOX: Not for three hours. 
T'POL: Is there any harm in starting now? 
PHLOX: (sitting up) I can apply it myself, thank you. Perhaps you need
another sedative. 
T'POL: Rest is not what I need. 
PHLOX: Sub-Commander, this behaviour is hardly appropriate. 
T'POL: My name is T'Pol. You don't find me attractive? 
PHLOX: Of course I do, but that is not the issue. 
T'POL: I am familiar with Denobulan sexuality. I know that your
marriages aren't exclusive. 
PHLOX: You and I are colleagues. It's against regulations. 
T'POL: Starfleet regulations. There's no reason to be restrained by
human morality. 
PHLOX: It's obvious you're not well. Please. 
T'POL: You have no idea what you're denying yourself. 
PHLOX: Your endorphin and hormonal levels are dangerously high. 
T'POL: You don't understand. I'm not ill. 
PHLOX: These are hardly normal readings. 
T'POL: They're normal for a Vulcan in my condition. 
PHLOX: You know what's wrong with you? 
T'POL: It's not something we discuss with others. 
PHLOX: I believe it's time for you to amend that policy. You have my
assurance it will remain between us. 
T'POL: We call it the pon farr, the cycle of mating. 
PHLOX: Have you gone through this before? 
T'POL: (shakes head) It's not time. 
PHLOX: It's possible the infection acted as a catalyst. 
T'POL: What caused it doesn't matter. If I don't mate with a male,
Vulcan or otherwise, I'll die.
 [Planet
surface]
 ARCHER:
That ship you mentioned, the Tezra, sounds pretty important to you. 
SKALAAR: More than you know. If Kago collects the reward he'll probably
waste it on Orion slave girls. Not me, I'm going to do something useful
with it. 
ARCHER: I don't understand why you want a cargo ship. It doesn't seem
practical in your line of work. 
SKALAAR: You think I've been chasing fugitives my entire life? Once I
get the money I'll have enough to pay off the impound fees. I'll be a
freighter captain again. 
ARCHER: My helmsman used to run freight. The two of you would probably
have a lot to talk about. 
SKALAAR: The Tezra isn't like any other cargo ship. She was the first
of her class, the fastest ever built. She could haul a million metric
tons at warp four point five. Even your starship isn't capable of that.
I retrofitted her engines myself. 
ARCHER: You never told me why it was impounded. 
SKALAAR: My brother and I were hauling a shipment of fire-salt. I
thought I could trim two or three days off our journey by cutting
across the most insignificant corner of Klingon space. I learned very
quickly there's no thing as an insignificant corner of Klingon space.
We were lucky to escape with our lives, though we did pay a price. 
ARCHER: They took your ship? 
SKALAAR: And it's cargo too. My brother never forgave me. I've been
trying to find a way to get the Tezra back every since. What are you
doing! (Archer throws him to the ground and pulls a weapon.) 
ARCHER: Did you really think I wanted this engine fixed? You're taking
me to be executed. 
SKALAAR: Don't worry, we'll meet Goroth on time.
 [Decon
chamber]
 (T'Pol
wakes up as Phlox is working with test tubes and a PADD.) 
PHLOX: Feel any better? 
T'POL: (breathing heavily) I'm hungry. 
PHLOX: Our meals will be here soon. 
T'POL: I wasn't referring to food. 
PHLOX: I'm working as quickly as I can. The serum should help alleviate
most of your symptoms. 
T'POL: There's a far simpler treatment. 
PHLOX: I'd prefer to explore a more conventional approach. 
T'POL: You have the cure. It's unethical for you to withhold it,
Doctor. 
PHLOX: This mating cycle of yours was artificially induced. We can't be
certain that a physical encounter would help. 
T'POL: I'm willing to try. 
PHLOX: Sub-commander. 
T'POL: Don't be frightened. I won't hurt you. (She rubs up against him.) 
PHLOX: You're disturbing my serum! You obviously need to be sedated
again. 
T'POL: No more hyposprays. (The comm. chimes) 
PHLOX: One of us should probably answer that. It could be news about
the Captain. This is Phlox. 
TUCKER [OC]: Anyone hungry in there? I brought you some supper. 
PHLOX: Just in the nick of time, Commander. (to T'Pol) It would be best
if you remained here.
 [Isolation
ward window]
 TUCKER:
How are you two holding up? 
PHLOX: Well enough. Have you been able to locate Captain Archer? 
TUCKER: We're tracking another warp signature, hoping this one is the
real thing. Are those the ones you wanted? (Phlox checks the meals and a case of something.) 
PHLOX: Yes, thank you. 
T'POL: Is that food? (She snatches a meal.) 
TUCKER: Yeah. I had Chef make you some (T'Pol devours it greedily.) TUCKER: Is she
all right? 
PHLOX: She developed a slight fever. Nothing to be concerned about.
(Phlox pushes her back into the chamber and shuts the door on her.) 
REED [OC]: Bridge to Commander Tucker. 
TUCKER: Go ahead. 
REED [OC]: We're approaching the coordinates. 
TUCKER: On my way. (to Phlox) Call if you need anything.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER:
What have you got? 
REED: Two matching warp signatures, both in the upper atmosphere. More
subspace beacons. There is a ship on the surface. It seems to have
suffered engine damage, but it's not Tellarite. 
TUCKER: Biosigns? 
REED: One. 
TUCKER: Open a channel. 
KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]: Yes. 
TUCKER: Sorry to bother you, but we're looking for a Tellarite shuttle.
Have you seen one? 
KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]: How much did the Klingons offer you? 
TUCKER: Klingons? Look, there must be some sort of misunderstanding
here. We're looking for our Captain. 
KAGO-DARR [on viewscreen]: Your Captain. He's got a price on his head. He's
probably halfway to Klingon space by now. (Ends transmission) 
TUCKER: Travis, how close are we to Klingon space? 
TRAVIS: Less than six light years. 
TUCKER: If that Tellarite's looking to collect some kind of reward we'd
better find him before he gets there. Set a course. Take us back to
warp. 
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
 [Skalaar's
ship]
 (Docked
at a space station.) 
GAAVRIN: What are you doing here? 
SKALAAR: I need your help. 
GAAVRIN: You shouldn't have brought him. 
SKALAAR: You think I would have come here if I had a choice? I need an
antimatter injector. 
GAAVRIN: And I suppose you have no way of paying for it. 
SKALAAR: Do you know who this is? He's the only prisoner who's ever
escaped from Rura Penthe. The Klingons are offering a fortune to get
him back. Tell him. (Archer stays quiet) Tell him! 
GAAVRIN: If I give you the injector, you have to promise never to come
back here. 
SKALAAR: Of course I'm coming back. You're going to be my first
officer. 
GAAVRIN: That was years ago. I work here now. 
SKALAAR: Scrubbing plasma injectors? Is that how you want your children
to see you? 
GAAVRIN: It's better than hunting criminals. 
SKALAAR: You think that I enjoy spending my time with vermin like him? 
GAAVRIN: I have work to do. 
SKALAAR: Please, don't turn your back on me again. We can reclaim the
Tezra. 
GAAVRIN: You won't want that ship after you see it. 
SKALAAR: Why not? 
GAAVRIN: The Klingons cannibalised her. Every power relay, every
conduit. 
SKALAAR: The engines? 
GAAVRIN: They're gone. I'll give you the injector, but after that I
want you to leave. (Gaavrin leaves.) 
ARCHER: What do you plan to do now? 
SKALAAR: Get that injector and install it. 
ARCHER: And then? I suppose you'll turn me over to the Klingons. I'll
be disembowelled with one of those nasty looking swords of theirs.
You'll collect your nine thousand darseks but it won't get you the
Tezra back. 
SKALAAR: What are you trying to say? 
ARCHER: The Klingons took your freighter, your livelihood, damaged your
relationship with your brother, and what do you get in exchange? Nine
thousand darseks. Doesn't seem like a very fair trade to me. 
SKALAAR: What choice do I have? I told you, if I let you go they'd kill
me. 
ARCHER: Maybe not. Have you ever been aboard Goroth's ship? 
SKALAAR: Twice. Why?
 [Decon
Chamber]
 (T'Pol
is muttering in Vulcan.) 
PHLOX: I beg your pardon? 
T'POL: (on her knees) Let me out. 
PHLOX: You know I can't do that. 
T'POL: The heat. It's unbearable. 
PHLOX: If I lower the temperature, the serum will start to congeal. 
T'POL: I don't want your serum. Open the door. 
PHLOX: I assure you, you're going to feel much better in just a few
minutes. 
T'POL: Open it! 
PHLOX: This will only take a moment. (she fends him off) Your
biochemical imbalance is growing worse. If we don't treat it now, the
damage to your limbic system could be irreversible. You said it
yourself, T'Pol, it could kill you. 
T'POL: Stay away from me. 
PHLOX: One injection, that's all I ask. Very well. (He opens the door.) PHLOX: You're
free to go. Four two eight six four. That's the locking code. Denobulan
medical ethics prevent me from treating patients against their will.
Four two eight six four! (He tries to inject her from behind as she
stands at the keypad, but she knocks him out instead. The code doesn't
work so she rips the panel from the wall, forces the door open by hand
and dashes into the corridor. Phlox gets up.)
PHLOX: Phlox to the Bridge. 
TUCKER [OC]: Tucker here. 
PHLOX: You may want to evacuate D deck.
 [Corridor]
 (Reed
and his security team are in spacesuits.) 
REED: She's still in this section. The doctor says she's irrational, so
use caution. 
SECURITY: Yes, sir. (They split up to search.) 
T'POL: Malcolm. I need your assistance. 
REED: We've been very worried about you, Sub-Commander. Let's get you
back to the Doctor. 
T'POL: I can't return to the doctor. He's refusing to treat me. How
long has it been? 
REED: I beg your pardon (She's almost trying to climb into his
spacesuit with him.) 
T'POL: Since you've mated. I've seen the way you look at me on the
Bridge. 
REED: Why don't we discuss this in Decon. 
T'POL: My quarters would be more comfortable. (She reaches for the
helmet lock and he pushes her away.) 
REED: Doctor Phlox was very insistent. (Reed puts his hand on his phase
pistol, she pushes him against the bulkhead and he falls. She runs off
but gets trapped at an intersection by the three men.) REED: Follow me,
Sub-Commander. (She rushes at him and gets stunned.)
 [Skalaar's
ship]
 (Docked
with a Klingon vessel.) SKALAAR: Welcome. (Skalaar gets pushed aside, and a Klingon scans Archer to
check his identity.) 
GOROTH: The Empire never forgets its enemies. Taka! 
SKALAAR: What about my payment? (Goroth throws a box at him.) 
GOROTH: Six thousand darseks. 
SKALAAR: We agreed to nine. 
GOROTH: Did we? 
ARCHER: That's blood money, Skalaar. I hope you enjoy it. 
(They take Archer away and go to warp.)
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI:
We're being hailed, Commander. It's the Tellarite ship. 
TUCKER: What? Put him through. (In Goroth's brig, Archer
frees himself from his handcuffs, then uses a device concealed in them to
open the door. He uses the cuffs to eventually bludgeon a guard who
comes running at the alarm, takes his disrupter and runs.)
 [Bridge]
 REED:
I've got them. Bearing two two six mark seven one. 
TUCKER: Set a course. Go to Tactical Alert.
 [Goroth's
ship - Corridor]
 (Archer
takes out two guards and tries to get into an escape pod, but fails. He
has a gun fight with more Klingons.) 
GOROTH: Where do you think you can go, human? There isn't a planet
within fifty light years. 
(Archer blasts his way into an escape pod and launches it.) 
GOROTH: He won't get far. Drop out of warp. 
KLINGON: Should I charge weapons? 
GOROTH: No. I want him alive.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS:
I see him. Eight hundred thousand kilometres. 
TUCKER: What about the Klingons? 
REED: They're closing in on him. 
(The Klingons lock a tractor beam onto the pod, but Enterprise's
weapons fire disrupts it.) 
REED: They're charging weapons. (Enterprise shakes.) 
TUCKER: Return fire. Deploy the grappler. 
TRAVIS: They're not making it easy. 
TUCKER: Malcolm? 
REED: I'm doing the best I can, sir. Their weapon ports are heavily
shielded. 
TRAVIS: Got it! 
TUCKER: Bring him in. (The final phase cannon salvo does damage.) 
REED: Their weapons are down. 
TUCKER: The pod? 
TRAVIS: Safe and sound, Launch bay two. 
TUCKER: Let's get the hell out of here.
 [Decon
Chamber]

(Phlox enters fully clothed, and wakes T'Pol with a hypospray)
 
PHLOX: You'll be pleased to know the microbe's been eliminated from your system. Your premature mating cycle has ended. 
T'POL: Did I do anything inappropriate? 
PHLOX: I've had patients treat me far worse. 
T'POL: Did we? 
PHLOX: Denobulan males aren't comfortable discussing such topics. 
T'POL: I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to anyone. 
PHLOX: I'd never violate a patient's privacy. 
(He helps her to her feet.)
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER:
Rough ride? 
ARCHER: What's the status of the Klingons? 
TUCKER: We damaged their port nacelle. They're limping back to Kronos. 
ARCHER: Where's T'Pol? 
TUCKER: She's in Decon with Doctor Phlox. 
ARCHER: What happened? 
REED: It's a long story. 
HOSHI: You're being hailed, Captain. 
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: I see you made it back safely. 
ARCHER: Do you think the Klingons know you gave me that lock pick? 
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: I don't see why they would. 
ARCHER: What are you going to do with your reward? 
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: I'm not sure. If you know of an old freighter
for sale? 
ARCHER: I'll keep my eyes open. 
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: Be careful, Captain. It's likely the Klingons
will double their bounty. 
ARCHER: I hope you won't be the one to collect it. 
SKALAAR [on viewscreen]: No promises.

Expanse
 Mission date: Apr 24, 2153
Original Airdate: 21 May, 2003
  (A round metallic object comes out of nowhere and
stops above the Earth. A yellow, flame-like beam is emitted. It strikes
the ground in Florida, cutting a massive trench into the planet as it
moves southwards into the ocean. Once it's energy is expended, the
object flies apart and the central portion falls to Earth.)
 [Klingon
Council Chamber]
CHANCELLOR: Twice, twice he's been captured, and twice he's escaped.
Our Magistrate should never have shown him mercy. He should have been
executed for his crimes.
COUNCILLOR: You had a simple mission, Duras. Locate the rebels that
Archer was harbouring and return them to the Empire. But you failed.
Archer made a fool of you.
CHANCELLOR: We are offering you a chance to regain your command, and
your honour.
DURAS: I will not fail.
 [Briefing
room]
 REED:
It must be something pretty serious. (Tucker enters.)
TUCKER: What's going on?
REED: The Captain wants to talk to us.
TUCKER: About what?
HOSHI: He's speaking to Admiral Forrest. It’s the third time in the
last hour.
TUCKER: Well, something's obviously up.
PHLOX: I can't remember the last time he asked me to join the senior
staff for a briefing.
REED: Maybe it has something to do with the (Archer enters, and they all stand.)
ARCHER: There's been an attack on Earth.
TUCKER: What do you mean, attack?
ARCHER: A probe. They don't know where it came from. It fired a weapon
that cut a swath four thousand kilometres long from Florida to
Venezuela. There may have been a million casualties.
REED: A million?
ARCHER: We've been recalled.
TUCKER: Did they say why?
ARCHER: I didn't ask.
TRAVIS: It'll take a while to get back, sir.
CREWMAN [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
CREWMAN: It's Admiral Forrest, sir.
ARCHER: Understood. Set a course, Travis. Warp five.
 [Ready
room]
(Archer is staring out of a port hole. The doorbell chimes.)  ARCHER:
Come in.
TUCKER: Excuse me, Captain.
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: When you spoke to Admiral Forrest, did he say what part of
Florida was hit?
ARCHER: No, I'm sorry.
TUCKER: She may have been away. Architects take a lot of trips. (Archer finally turns around.)
ARCHER: Older or younger?
TUCKER: My baby sister. When we were in school I made sure all the boys
in her class got a good look at me. None of them ever messed with her.
ARCHER: Maybe she was away.
TUCKER: Anything you can tell me about what the Admiral said?
ARCHER: The number of casualties has been revised. It's up to three
million.
TUCKER: Why would someone do this? (The doorbell chimes.)
ARCHER: Come in.
T'POL: I spoke with Ambassador Soval.
ARCHER: And?
T'POL: A Vulcan transport located the pod in central Asia. They
retrieved it and brought it to Starfleet Headquarters.
ARCHER: What do they know?
T'POL: Very little. There was a pilot, killed on impact.
TUCKER: Who the hell was he? What species?
T'POL: They don't know.
TUCKER: They say anything about what part of Florida was hit?
T'POL: No.
ARCHER: Trip's sister lives in Florida. (comm. beep) Archer.
REED [OC]: Captain, we've got Suliban ships. Eight of them, approaching
at high warp.
ARCHER: Just what we need. Tactical alert.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Hail them.
HOSHI: They're not responding.
ARCHER: Try again. (The lights go out. Two Suliban are seen on the ceiling, The
lights come back on and Archer has gone.)
REED: The captain.
 [Suliban
ship]
 SILIK:
There's someone who needs to speak with you.
ARCHER: Silik! I knew you'd have something to do with this.
SILIK: Do with what?
ARCHER: Millions of people. You killed millions of people!
SILIK: I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about. (Archer gets
in his face.) SILIK: That wouldn't be wise, Captain.
ARCHER: What the hell am I doing here?
SILIK: There's someone who needs to speak with you. He has information
you should find helpful. Don't worry, you won't be harmed.
ARCHER: Information about what?
SILIK: Something to do with your species. It's in great danger.
 [Temporal
communications room]
 (A
humanoid silhouette is in a cone of light.)
SILIK: He can see you more clearly if you move closer.
ARCHER: Who is he?
SILIK: He wants to talk to you. It would be foolish to ignore him.
ARCHER: What do you want?
FUTURE MAN: Your planet was attacked.
ARCHER: I'm aware of that.
FUTURE MAN: What you're not aware of is why. The probe was sent by the
Xindi. They learned that their world would be destroyed by humans in
four hundred years.
ARCHER: How would they know what's going to happen in four hundred
years?
FUTURE MAN: They were told by people from the future. People who can
communicate through time.
ARCHER: Are they the ones the Suliban are working for?
FUTURE MAN: The Suliban work for me.
ARCHER: So you're the one who tried to start a civil war in the Klingon
Empire, the one who's manipulated my mission from day one.
FUTURE MAN: The people who have contacted the Xindi belong to another
faction. The probe was only a test. The Xindi are building a far more
powerful weapon. When it is completed, they will use it to destroy
Earth.
ARCHER: Annihilate us before we can annihilate them. Why are you
telling me this? FUTURE MAN: The Xindi were not supposed to learn of
their future. If they deploy this weapon, it will contaminate the
timeline. You must not let that happen.
ARCHER: Why should I believe you?
FUTURE MAN: You have no choice but to believe me.
 [Ready
room]
 T'POL:
If this time traveller is trying to protect humanity, why didn't he
tell you all this before millions of people were killed?
ARCHER: He didn't think we'd believe him. He's probably right.
T'POL: I'm sure Starfleet and the High Command will find a far more
logical explanation of who attacked Earth.
ARCHER: He may be telling the truth. If he is, I need your support, not
your damn scepticism.
Captain's Starlog, April 24th, 2153.The journey home has been very
difficult. We've now learned that over seven million people were lost.

(There is a bright, bright sun in the centre of the viewscreen.)
 TRAVIS:
Captain, that's our sun.
REED: A vessel's dropping out of warp.
ARCHER: Where?
TRAVIS: Two hundred kilometres off port.
ARCHER: Who are they?
REED: They've fired some kind of (Enterprise is struck by weapons fire.)
REED: That one took out both forward phase cannons.
ARCHER: You still have torpedoes.
T'POL: It's a Klingon bird of prey.
(A nacelle is hit and starts smoking.)
HOSHI: They want you, sir. They're saying they won't destroy Enterprise
if you surrender to them. Archer's an enemy of the Empire. He must be
brought to justice if honour's to be regained.
ARCHER: Duras.
 [Duras's
ship]
OFFICER: Both their nacelles are crippled.
DURAS: Weapons?
HELM: Their cannons are down
DURAS: Cease firing. Prepare a boarding party.
OFFICER: Three ships approaching. (The Bird of Prey is strafed from all
directions.) Earth vessels.
DURAS: Return fire!
HELM: Shields are failing.
DURAS: Are they offline?
HELM: No, sir.
DURAS: Then keep firing.
OFFICER: We've lost disruptor banks three and four.
DURAS: Withdraw! Go to warp speed.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI:
It's Captain Ramirez, sir, on the Intrepid.
RAMIREZ [on viewscreen]: (a dark haired man) What the hell was that all
about?
ARCHER: A Klingon named Duras. He's not very fond of me.
RAMIREZ [on viewscreen]: Welcome home, Captain. I wish it was under
better circumstances.
(As they enter orbit, they view the huge line running down from east of
Lake Okeechobee straight south.)
 [Starfleet
Headquarters - Forrest's office]
FORREST: I told Command everything you said. They're having a hard time
buying it.
ARCHER: Do they have a better idea of who did this? And how about the
Vulcans? I suppose you think I'm hallucinating.
SOVAL: Our Science Directorate has determined that time travel is
impossible.
ARCHER: Are you willing to risk a second attack? All I'm asking is to
take Enterprise and find these Xindi. What do we have to lose, a single
starship. Seems like a small price to pay if there's one chance in a
million that he's right.
SOVAL: Do you know where these co-ordinates he gave you are?
ARCHER: At warp five, about a three month trip.
SOVAL: They're inside the Delphic Expanse.
ARCHER: What's that?
SOVAL: A region of space nearly two thousand light years across. Vulcan
ships have entered it, but only a few have returned.
ARCHER: Sounds like your talking about the Bermuda Triangle.
SOVAL: There has been reports of fierce and dangerous species,
unexplained anomalies. In some regions, even the laws of physics don't
apply. Twenty years ago, a Klingon vessel emerged from the Expanse.
Every crewmen on board has been anatomically inverted, their bodies
splayed open, and they were still alive. You'd be more than foolish to
pursue this course of action.
ARCHER: It's a risk I'm willing to take, and I imagine most of my crew
would be with me.
SOVAL: This is typical of your impulsiveness. You'd be putting your
crew's lives at stake when you have no evidence that anything you were
told were true.
FORREST: We've lost a lot of people already, Jon. Starfleet Command
would need some kind of proof before they let you go.
ARCHER: I'm not sure the person I spoke to was from the future or not,
but he knew this would be the reaction that I'd get, so he did give me
proof.
 [Secure
Storage Room]
 (The
three enter, Archer takes out a scanner and starts walking around the
bits of metal.)
FORREST: Jon?
ARCHER: This is quantum dating the debris. Take a look. The principal
alloy in this piece was synthesised within the last four years. This
one, about a year earlier.
SOVAL: What exactly are you trying to show us, Captain?
ARCHER: Twelve years for this piece.
FORREST: Your point, Jonathan.
ARCHER: I'm getting to it. (He finds a small component.) ARCHER: You might find
this interesting.
FORREST: Your scanner's not working properly.
ARCHER: Why is that, sir?
FORREST: The quantum data reads minus four twenty.
ARCHER: What's wrong with that?
FORREST: Quantum dating always registers in positive numbers.
ARCHER: (comparing scanners) Then I guess this ones not working either.
SOVAL: You said he told you this faction from the future could only
communicate through time, so how do you suggest they get this component
to the Xindi?
ARCHER: I haven't the slightest idea. But that doesn't change what's on
these scanners. This fragment's from the future, unless you have
another explanation.
SOVAL: A lack of another explanation doesn't make your assumption
correct.
FORREST: I'll speak with Command.
ARCHER: I'd like to take a look in there. (Forrest opens cryo-unit with
armed guards standing around to reveal a blackened alien corpse)
SOVAL: Are you suggesting this is a Xindi?
ARCHER: I sure as hell would like to find out.
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox introduces a Vulcan.)  PHLOX:
This is Doctor Fer'at.
ARCHER: I don't have a lot of time. What's up?
PHLOX: The Vulcan research team detected traces of pyretic radiation in
the alien debris.
ARCHER: Why didn't Starfleet catch it?
FER'AT: Some of our technology is still more advanced then yours.
PHLOX: We're going to need to treat anyone who got close to the
wreckage. Doctor Fer'at is here to determine the extent of your
exposure.
FER'AT: It shouldn't take long. Please, have a seat. (Archer perches on
the imaging chamber gurney.) FER'AT: Have you experienced any nausea or
dizziness?
ARCHER: No.
FER'AT: Numbness in your extremities?
ARCHER: I feel fine.
FER'AT: I was told that you think a piece of the wreckage came from the
future.
ARCHER: I know, Vulcan's don't believe in time travel.
FER'AT: Some of us do. Tell me, this time traveller you met, was he
humanoid?
ARCHER: How do you know about that?
FER'AT: I was briefed before coming here.
ARCHER: He seemed humanoid, but I couldn't see him that well.
FER'AT: Have you encountered people from the future before?
ARCHER: A number of times. Does this have anything to do with the
radiation?
FER'AT: I was just curious. It must be very difficult to have so many
people question your story. Does it upset you?
ARCHER: Doesn't help.
FER'AT: But how does it make you feel?
ARCHER: I told you, it doesn't help.
FER'AT: I can sense some anger when you talk about this.
ARCHER: It's kind of strange that a Vulcan would be so interested in my
feelings.
FER'AT: Just curious, Your exposure seems minimal. You'll require very
little treatment. I imagine you must have felt very anxious after
meeting someone from the future.
ARCHER: Why would you imagine that?
PHLOX: I'm afraid this examination is over.
FER'AT: I'm nearly finished.
PHLOX: You are finished, I just checked the Vulcan database. There's
only one Doctor Fer'at listed, and he's not a pathologist, he's a
psychiatric analyst.
ARCHER: Soval sure is persistent. What did he want you to do? Come back
with proof that I'm out of my mind?
PHLOX: You come to my Sickbay under false pretenses. Where are your
medical ethics?!
FER'AT: I'm just doing what I was told to.
ARCHER: Well I'm telling you to get the hell off my ship. If you
wouldn't mind, Phlox, I'd like you to escort our guest to the airlock.
PHLOX: Gladly.

scene - Chinese Restaurant]
(Archer has walked down the street in a leather jacket, and entered the
building. He's greeted by the Maitre D')
TOMMY: Jonathan.
ARCHER: You're a sight for sore eyes, Tommy.
TOMMY: Good to see you.
ARCHER: Slow tonight.
TOMMY: People are staying home, ever since.
ARCHER: Is she here?
TOMMY: Over there. You are late.
ARCHER: Thanks. Bring me a Scotch.
TOMMY: Right away.
(He goes around a screen to see Becky the brunette sitting at a table.)
ARCHER: I'm really sorry.
BECKY: (British accent) I can't remember the last time you weren't
late. Did they bring you back because of what happened? For how long?
ARCHER: I wish it was longer. I was hoping to spend some time with you.
BECKY: Do they know who did this, why they did this?
ARCHER: We know a little bit, but not enough. I'll probably be gone for
a long time, Becky.
BECKY: You've been gone for a long time before, and if I find out
you've got a girl in every spaceport. (he strokes her cheek, then they
kiss) I suppose you expect me to invite you back to my apartment.
ARCHER: What are my chances?
BECKY: (opening a fortune cookie) You're in luck.
 [Florida]
 (The
gash in the ground is a neat semicircle, but huge.)
REED: I'm so sorry.
TUCKER: The house was over there. Less then a kilometre. See over
there? (A piece of wreckage dangling by the precipice.)TUCKER: That was the old
movie theatre. When we were kids, if I didn't take my sister with me
she'd scream like a banshee.
REED: Are you certain she was here when it happened?
TUCKER: Someone would have heard from her if she wasn't.
 [Deleted
scene - Hoshi's quarters]
(Hoshi is packing a bag.)HOSHI: Come in. This is a nice surprise.
ARCHER: How'd it go with your folks?
HOSHI: I think I might need to brush up on my Japanese.
ARCHER: I doubt it. We got the new upgrades for the Universal
Translator.
HOSHI: That'll make life a whole lot easier.
ARCHER: It'll never replace a linguist with a magical ear.
HOSHI: Not so magical.
ARCHER: Well, that's a matter of opinion. (He reads the spine of a book.)
ARCHER: Languages of the Sub-Sahara. I'm surprised you're leaving that one
here.
HOSHI: I haven't read it yet.
ARCHER: So why not take it with you?
HOSHI: Captain, I'm sending these books home to my mother. It'll give
me more shelf space. There's been a lot written about alien languages
since we've been gone.
ARCHER: And the clothes are going to?
HOSHI: My mother. Thought it was time to upgrade my civvies.
ARCHER: I thought you were leaving.
HOSHI: Why would you think that?
ARCHER: I don't know. You're a teacher, an academic.
HOSHI: And that means I'm not capable of handling myself on the new
mission?
ARCHER: That's not what I meant.
HOSHI: I don't know what's inside this Expanse, sir, but I think I've
proven that I can handle myself in difficult situations and even
provide a little help along the way. I assume you have no problem with
my remaining on board.
ARCHER: I wouldn't have it any other way. 
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. After days of debate, Starfleet's
finally informed me that we're to proceed with our new mission.
 [Shuttlepod]
 (They fly
past a ship in Spacedock. Archer is piloting.)
ARCHER: The NX-02.
FORREST: She'll be ready to launch in fourteen months.
ARCHER: A long time.
FORREST: Hopefully you'll be back well before then.
ARCHER: Hopefully. What kind of armaments will she have?
FORREST: The same complement of weapons that you'll have once the
retrofit is done. Have you told your crew?
ARCHER: This morning.
FORREST: How many are staying aboard?
ARCHER: Some haven't decided yet, but I don't think more then eight or
nine will be leaving. I talked to General Casey a few hours ago.
FORREST: His team should be arriving at eighteen hundred hours. I was
surprised you asked for them. You think you'll be comfortable with the
military on board?
ARCHER: I don't have a problem with non-Starfleet personnel. The
General tell me these are the best he has. I'm going to need all the
muscle I can get when we cross into the Expanse.
FORREST: You weren't told where in this Expanse you were supposed to
look.
ARCHER: Not even a hint.
FORREST: This weapon they're building, did he say how long it was going
to take them?
ARCHER: I didn't think he would have warned us if we didn't have a
chance of stopping them.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX:
Sub-Commander. Is there something I can do for you?
T'POL: Are you confident with your decision, Doctor?
PHLOX: What decision would that be?
T'POL: To remain on Enterprise. Crewman Fuller just told me a shuttle's
on its way with two hundred snow beetles.
PHLOX: They could be for my replacement.
T'POL: There isn't a doctor in Starfleet that would have the slightest
idea what to do with them.
PHLOX: And what about you?
T'POL: The High Command has made it clear that they don't want me to
enter the Delphic Expanse.
PHLOX: I'm much more interested in hearing what you want.
T'POL: it's not my place to disobey the High Command.
PHLOX: Nonsense. You've done it before. It's interesting. You and I,
the only aliens on board this vessel. To go or to stay. For me, it was
a simple question of loyalty towards the Captain and the sad
realisation that he'll need me more then ever on such a crucial
mission. But for you it's a more difficult decision. Does your
allegiance lie with the High Command or with Captain Archer? (A crewwoman wheels in a box.)
CREWWOMAN: This just arrived, Doctor.
PHLOX: (reading the inventory) Ah.
T'POL: Thank you, Doctor. (She leaves him making chirruping noises to the
contents of the box.)
 [Armoury]
 REED:
Photonic torpedoes. Their range is over fifty times greater than our
conventional torpedoes, and they have a variable yield. They can knock
the comm. array off a shuttlepod without scratching the hull or they
can put a three kilometre crater into an asteroid.
TUCKER: How long is it going to take to reconfigure the tubes?
REED: We've got three teams working on it. They promise me it'll be
done before we leave Spacedock, but I've got to start integrating them
into the power grid.
TUCKER: Let's go.
 [Corridor]
 REED:
Is there going to be some kind of service?
TUCKER: For Lizzie? If you're talking about a funeral, it's kind of
pointless when there's nothing left.
REED: I guess I was talking about a memorial.
TUCKER: My sister wasn't big on memorials.
REED: I read there was a day of remembrance for all the victims a
couple of months ago. I'm sorry you missed it.
TUCKER: Why are you so obsessed with memorials?
REED: I'm not obsessed.
TUCKER: She's dead. So are seven million others. She was no more
important than any of them.
REED: She was more important to you. There nothing wrong in admitting
that.
TUCKER: I'm getting real tired of you telling me what I can and can't
do. And while we're at it, I don't need you to remind me that Elizabeth
was killed, so just let it alone. Maybe you should pay more attention
to upgrading your weapons, so you can blow the hell out of those
bastards when we find them.
 [Forrest's
office]
 ARCHER:
With all due respects Admiral, what is the point of me watching this.
Is it supposed to frighten me, make me change my mind about commanding
this mission?
SOVAL: It's important for you to see what you'll be facing. The
Vaankara was in the Delphic Expanse for less then two days when we
received a distress call. This transmission arrived six hours later.
(Pictures on screen of Vulcans screaming, fighting and killing each
other.) SOVAL: Less then an hour later the Vaankara was destroyed. There was no
indication of a malfunction or an attack.
ARCHER: Are you suggesting the crew was responsible?
SOVAL: I'm suggesting you reconsider this mission.
ARCHER: (to Forrest) Is there anything else, sir? (Forrest shakes his
head, so Archer goes to leave.)
SOVAL: I need to speak with you, T'Pol.
 [Outside
Fleet Operations Center]
 SOVAL:
If all goes well you should be able to return to your duties on Earth
within a year. That is, if you're still interested. You haven't been
back to Vulcan for some time. You may find your assignment at the
Ministry of Information refreshing.
T'POL: I don't understand why I can't stay in San Francisco.
SOVAL: You've spent far to much time with humans. It would be best if
you returned home for a while.
T'POL: You thought it was crucial to place a Vulcan on Enterprise
during its first mission. Why not now?
SOVAL: You were there to provide logic to a crew of humans who insisted
on leaving before they were ready, but logic can't help them inside the
Delphic Expanse.
T'POL: Can you be certain of that?
SOVAL: The High Command was quite specific. You're to return to Vulcan.
T'POL: I believe that should be my decision.
SOVAL: This is not the matter of choice. Defying the High Command would
mean immediate dismissal. You know that.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER:
Soval agreed to let us take her back to Vulcan if it's all right with
you.
FORREST: It's not that far out of your way. How's that last refit team
doing?
ARCHER: Scheduled to be done by oh six hundred.
FORREST: I could tell you there are a lot of people counting on you,
but I don't need to do that, do I?
ARCHER: No, sir.
FORREST: Good luck, Jon. (They shake hands. The umbilicals disengage and Enterprise moves out of Spacedock.)
 [Duras's
ship]
 DURAS:
Have they gone to warp?
OFFICER: Not yet
DURAS: Charge weapons and prepare to bring them online.
 [Mess
hall]
 ARCHER:
It's bad enough one of us is up in the middle of the night.
TUCKER: (pouring himself a slug) How's Porthos holding up? If no people
have returned from the Delphic Expanse, I doubt any dogs have.
ARCHER: He must be doing better then we are. He's fast asleep.
TUCKER: You picked a new science officer?
ARCHER: No.
TUCKER: You're gonna miss her, aren't you.
ARCHER: When they first assigned her, I felt like strangling Soval.
TUCKER: She does kind of grow on you.
ARCHER: I would think you'd be the first one to show her to the
airlock. (Tucker pours another slug of whiskey into their glasses.)
TUCKER: Nah. To
Henry Archer. I wonder what he would have thought if he knew his engine
was gonna help save the human race.
ARCHER: When I got this job, commanding the first warp five ship was
about as big as a responsibility as I could imagined. Then, we began
running into so many bad guys, and I had to start thinking more about
the safety of eighty three people.
TUCKER: And now the stakes have gotten a lot bigger.
ARCHER: Weight of the world, Trip.
TUCKER: Literally. I can't wait to get in there, Captain, and find the
people who did this. And tell me we won't be tiptoeing around. None of
that non-interference crap T'Pol's always shoving down our throats.
Maybe its good thing she's leaving.
ARCHER: We'll do what we have to do, Trip. Whatever it takes. (The ship
judders.)
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
It's Duras.
ARCHER: You've been wanting to test those new torpedoes.
REED: What yield?
ARCHER: Start low. We just want to get them off our backs.
(Two torpedoes hit their target.)
 [Duras's
ship]
 DURAS:
What was that?
HELM: Antimatter warheads.
DURAS: Increase shielding and target their weapon ports.
 [Bridge]
 REED:
They're still on our backs, sir.
ARCHER: Bring the yield up. Fifty percent.
 [Duras's
ship]
(Explosions and damage.)
DURAS: I told you to target the weapons port!
HELM: Their hull plating's been enhanced!
OFFICER: Our warp drive is failing.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS:
They're dropping to impulse.
REED: Stand down weapons, sir?
ARCHER: (nods) How long will it take them to repair their engines?
T'POL: Impossible to determine.
ARCHER: Give me an educated guess.
T'POL: Three hours, possibly more.
ARCHER: What's our speed?
TRAVIS: Warp three, sir.
ARCHER: Go to four five. If we can make it to Vulcan space before they
get their engines back, they'll think twice about giving us any more
trouble.
 [Ready
room]
 (Archer
is not eating a meal, and not reading a book.)
ARCHER: Come in.
T'POL: Ensign Mayweather says we're two days from Vulcan.
ARCHER: Why don't you sit down? (she does) Just think, in two days
you'll be eating real Vulcan food.
T'POL: Chef's done an adequate job of approximating Vulcan cuisine.
ARCHER: Well you never did care for the way we smelled. At least you
won't have to put up with that anymore.
T'POL: I've gotten use to it.
ARCHER: How about all those emotions we bombard you with every day?
T'POL: I've grown accustomed to that as well, somewhat.
ARCHER: You're not making this easy. There's got to be something you're
looking forward to back home.
T'POL: I don't wish to return to Vulcan.
ARCHER: What?
T'POL: I want to remain aboard Enterprise, if you'll allow me to.
ARCHER: It's not a question of my allowing you. The High Command would
never agree to it.
T'POL: I've decided to resign my commission.
ARCHER: Why? You've worked so hard, T'Pol.
T'POL: You're taking Enterprise into a very dangerous place. This is no
time for me to leave.
ARCHER: We'll be all right.
T'POL: You'll need a science officer, whether she's a member of the
High Command or not.
ARCHER: I've been thinking about who to promote.
T'POL: You need me, Captain.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Keeping away from those Klingons isn't going to be easy as we thought.
TRAVIS: Sir?
ARCHER: We're not going to Vulcan. Mister Mayweather, set course for
the Delphic Expanse.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
Captain's starlog, supplemental. We've been travelling at warp five for
seven weeks. The crew is anxious to begin our mission.
 [Bridge]
 (The
ship is approaching a purple haze.)
ARCHER: Distance?
TRAVIS: Nearly a million kilometres.
TUCKER: Looks a hell of a hell of a lot closer than that.
T'POL: A common mistake when viewing something of this size.
ARCHER: Magnify. (Purple swirly stuff fills the viewscreen.)
TUCKER: Not very helpful.
TRAVIS: It's not that dense all the way through, is it?
ARCHER: The Vulcans said the Expanse is surrounded by thick layers of
thermobaric clouds. When their last ship went in, it took them almost
six hours to get through it. Anything on long range sensors?
T'POL: Nothing beyond the perimeter.
ARCHER: Point two impulse, Travis. Let's head in. (So they do.)ARCHER:
Anything?
T'POL: Nothing yet.
HOSHI: We've been in here for more then six hours.
ARCHER: Let's be patient.
TUCKER: (enters) We launched the communications buoy, sir. We got a
test signal through to Starfleet.
ARCHER: Keep them apprised of our position.
HOSHI: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: Got something?
T'POL: Yes.
TUCKER: Probably the buoy.
T'POL: Not unless you launched three of them. (Weapons fire from aft. One hits but the rest miss.)
 [Duras's
ship]
 HELM:
The targeting scanners won't lock on.
DURAS: Then get closer.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER:
I thought you said the Klingons wouldn't go into the Expanse.
ARCHER: We're not in the Expanse yet. Hold your course. Go to full
impulse.
TUCKER: I wouldn't recommend that, Captain. The intake manifolds are
having a tough enough time as it is.
ARCHER: You heard me, Travis.
TRAVIS: They're keeping up with us, sir. (more weapons hits)
HOSHI: We're being hailed.
ARCHER: Put it up.
DURAS [on viewscreen]: Surrender, or be destroyed.
ARCHER: Go to hell.
DURAS [on viewscreen]: You're out-gunned, Archer. Come about and be
prepared to be boarded. If you don't obey my orders I'll (Hoshi cuts
transmission)
T'POL: The perimeter clouds are dissipating. I'm detecting clear space
ahead.
ARCHER: That's why Duras wants us to come about. He's afraid of the
Expanse. Increase speed, Travis.
 [Duras's
ship]
OFFICER: The other ships are going to turn back.
DURAS: Cowards. We'll do it ourselves.
HELM: We're too close to the Expanse! (Duras drags him out of his seat
and takes the controls himself.)
 [Bridge]
 REED:
Only one left ,sir.
ARCHER: Keep firing.
T'POL: The Expanse is less than five minutes away.
TUCKER: Maybe he'll turn around like his friends.
ARCHER: I won't bet on it. Your new torpedoes aren't having the same
effect as last time.
REED: Duras has transferred his aft shields forward. Our weapons can't
penetrate them.
TUCKER: We just lost three antimatter injections, Captain. Any more and
we're in big trouble.
ARCHER: If he's transferred his shielding forward, what's protecting
his stern?
TUCKER: Does it matter? He's chasing us.
ARCHER: What's protecting his stern?
T'POL: Minimal shielding.
ARCHER: Think you can pull off an L4 at this speed?
TRAVIS: I can try, sir.
ARCHER: Then look for the densest cloud formation you can find. Captain
Archer to all hands, hold on!
TRAVIS: Captain. (A big black cloud is ahead.)
ARCHER: Looks good to me.
(Hidden from the Klingon, Enterprise loops the loop to end up astern of
Duras.)
 [Duras's
ship]
 DURAS:
Where are they? (The other officers look at each other as if to say
they know exactly where Enterprise is.)
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Fire. (Two torpedoes blow the Bird of Prey apart and Enterprise sails
through the middle.) ARCHER: Nice going, Travis.
TRAVIS: I hope you don't ask me to do that too often, sir.
HOSHI: The Expanse is ahead, Captain.
ARCHER: Did you lose any more of those injectors?
TUCKER: No, sir. We're good to go.
ARCHER: Sure you still want to tag along?
T'POL: It's only logical.
ARCHER: Straight and steady. Mister Mayweather. Let's see what's in
there.

The
Xindi
Original Airdate: 10 September, 2003
  ARCHER [OC]: Last
time on Enterprise
 ARCHER: There's been an attack on Earth. We've been recalled.
FUTURE MAN: (to Archer) The probe was sent by the Xindi. They learned
that their world would be destroyed by humans in four hundred years.
REED [Florida]: Is there going to be some kind of service?
TUCKER: My sister wasn't big on memorials.
TUCKER [Corridor]: She was no more important than any of them.
REED: She was more important to you. There's nothing wrong with
admitting that.
SOVAL [storage area]: Are you suggesting this is a Xindi?
ARCHER: (examining remains) I'd sure as hell like to find out.
SOVAL [outside Starfleet]: You're to return to Vulcan.
T'POL: I believe that should be my decision.
SOVAL [Forrest's office]: (monitor scenes of Vulcans attacking each other) We received a
distress call. Every crewman had been anatomically inverted. Their
bodies splayed open, and they were still alive.
T'POL [Ready room]: I want to remain aboard Enterprise. I've decided to resign my
commission.
FORREST [Shuttlepod]: (Enterprise in spacedock) Do you think you'll be comfortable
with military on board?
ARCHER: I don't have a problem with non-Starfleet personnel. I'm going
to need all the muscle I can get when we cross into the Expanse.
TUCKER [Mess hall]: I can't wait to get in there, Captain, to find the people who
did this. And tell me we won't be tip-toeing around. None of that
non-interference crap T'Pol's always shoving down our throats.
ARCHER: We'll do what we have to, Trip.
 [Xindi
Council Chamber]
HUMANOID: It could simply be a coincidence.
REPTILIAN: You're being naive. Their planet is fifty light years away.
It is not a coincidence.
HUMANOID: How do you know your contacts gave you accurate information?
INSECTOID: It's the beginning of an invasion. Hundreds of Earth ships
will follow.
HUMANOID: They have no way of knowing that we launched the probe.
INSECTOID: We must destroy the vessel.
REPTILIAN: How many humans are aboard?
INSECTOID: It doesn't matter. They must be destroyed before they find
the weapon.
ARBOREAL: When will it be ready?
DEGRA: The next series of tests is being prepared.
REPTILIAN: You will accomplish nothing if all you do is run tests.
ARBOREAL: We must be patient. We must follow the plan that we all
agreed to.
AQUATIC: Our future is at stake. This council mustn't be divided.
HUMANOID: (to Reptilian) Learn everything you can about this human
vessel.
 [Command
centre]
 ARCHER:
How long till we get there?
T'POL: Another three hours.
REED: Did the freighter captain say who we were supposed to contact?
ARCHER: The foreman of the north mine. He's expecting us.
T'POL: What makes this captain so certain that the miner's is Xindi?
ARCHER: He's not. He just said he thinks there was a Xindi aboard a
transport he took there a few years ago.
REED: And it is safe to enter orbit? There are no security
considerations?
ARCHER: He didn't mention any.
REED: With all due respect, sir, we should approach with caution. The
freighter captain was of questionable character.
ARCHER: Where are we, Malcolm?
REED: Sir?
ARCHER: This room. What did it used to be?
REED: A storage bay, sir. Conduit housings, I believe.
ARCHER: But it got retrofitted. Starfleet went to a lot of trouble to
turn it into our new Command centre. Why is that, Malcolm?
REED: Because of our mission, sir.
ARCHER: To find the Xindi, right?
REED: Right.
ARCHER: So this state of the art equipment was put in here to help us
gather all the pieces of the puzzle, figure out who's trying to destroy
Earth.
REED: Right.
ARCHER: Six weeks. We've been in this Expanse for six weeks. What data
have we gathered? What pieces of the puzzle have we started to put
together? Not a single one. We don't have the luxury of being safe or
cautious any more, and if the only lead we can find comes from a
freighter captain of questionable character, then that's good enough
for me. Understood? (leaves)
REED: Understood.
 [Mess
hall]
 HOSHI:
Is this seat taken?
(The MACOs all stand.)
HAYES: Ma'am.
HOSHI: I'm Hoshi Sato.
HAYES: We've familiarised ourselves with all the Bridge officers,
Ensign. I'm Major Hayes, this is Sergeant Kemper, Corporals Romero and
Chang.
HOSHI: Military Assault Command.
HAYES: Captain Archer wanted the best.
HOSHI: You seem to have all gotten your space legs.
KEMPER: Some of us are still visiting Doctor Phlox every morning.
ROMERO: The wonders of modern medicine.
HOSHI: What do you think of our doctor, Sergeant? I imagine you don't
run into many Denobulans in Duluth, Minnesota.
KEMPER: Actually, I'm stationed outside of Atlanta. No Denobulans, but
we have our fair share of alien visitors. You must have gone pretty
deep into our records. I haven't lived in Duluth since junior high
school.
HOSHI: You may have left Duluth, but you've still got plenty of Duluth
left in your inflections.
KEMPER: Excuse me?
HAYES: Ensign Sato's a linguist, Kemper. You give her enough time, she
could probably tell you what street you grew up on.
CHANG: Do you have any idea where we're headed, Ensign?
HOSHI: I'm sure Captain Archer will let us know when he has reason to.
HAYES: Let's hope it's soon. The quicker you folks find these Xindi,
the quicker we can get to work. We have a briefing in a few minutes. If
you'll excuse you.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER:
Just bay two?
TUCKER: Yes sir. Cargo bays one and three seem unaffected.
ARCHER: When did it start?
TUCKER: About ten minutes ago. Ensign McFarlane got pretty banged up
but he's going to be okay.
ARCHER: You're sure it's not a problem with the grav-plating.
TUCKER: Trust me, Captain. It's not the grav-plating.
 [Cargo
Bay two]
 (They
enter to see the contents of the bay all firmly sitting on right hand
wall.)
TUCKER: Careful, sir. Stay close to the door. They're scaring me.
(The floor shakes, then everything 'falls' to the left hand wall.)
ARCHER: You're right. It's not the grav-plating. Any volatile material
in those containers?
TUCKER: I would have known by now.
ARCHER: Seal it off. Let's hope this little anomaly doesn't last any
longer than the others did.
(Everything flies back to the right hand wall as they leave.)
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox
is looking at a microscope view on desk monitor as T'Pol enters,
wearing a
red v-necked catsuit.)
 PHLOX: Come,
look at this. The pigmentation is far more colourful that I would have
suspected.
T'POL: What are we looking at?
PHLOX: Xindi epithelial cells, harvested from the corpse they found
inside the crashed probe.
T'POL: It looks more like scales.
PHLOX: Precisely. When I'm finished constructing my physiometric
profile I wouldn't be surprised to find he has reptilian
characteristics.
T'POL: You wanted to see me.
PHLOX: Do you have any siblings?
T'POL: No.
PHLOX: Commander Tucker had one sister. She was killed in the attack.
T'POL: I'm aware of that.
PHLOX: He's having difficulty dealing with the loss.
T'POL: It's to be expected.
PHLOX: More specifically, it's affecting his sleep. I've been giving
him sedatives, but I'd like to see him start tapering off.
T'POL: I'm not sure I understand.
PHLOX: I believe the Commander would be a fine candidate for Vulcan
neuro-pressure.
T'POL: I doubt the Commander would have the patience to sit in one
place long enough to get through the first posture.
PHLOX: I'm certain with your delicate guidance
T'POL: Delicate is not a word I associate with Mister Tucker. The
instruction of neuro-pressure is a very intimate act.
PHLOX: And he's suffered a very intimate loss. He needs your help.
T'POL: Have him come to my quarters.
PHLOX: There's one little problem. Assuming that you'd agree to my
request, I suggested all of this to Commander Tucker earlier today, and
he was less than enthusiastic.
T'POL: I don't understand.
PHLOX: Perhaps if I could get him to go to your quarters, you might be
able to convince him of the lasting benefits of Vulcan neuro-pressure.
 [Mining
planet surface]
 (The
shuttlepod lands in a devastated looking place with a few wind turbines
within the quarry.)
REED: We should have worn EV suits.
ARCHER: The Doctor said it was safe for short periods.
REED: Safe? You call this safe? I've been in (cough)
ARCHER: Try not to breathe.
REED: Yes, sir.
 [Mine
complex]
 (Going
down some stairs, they are greeted by two men wearing breathing masks
and carrying guns.)
ARCHER: I'm Captain Archer of the Starship Enterprise. We've come to
see your
GUARD: This way.
(They follow through tunnels where various aliens are working.)
 [Mine
Foreman's Office]
FOREMAN: Archer.
ARCHER: I'm Jonathan Archer. This is Lieutenant Reed.
FOREMAN: I've been told you might be able to make it worth my while if
I were to arrange a certain introduction.
ARCHER: Depends what you mean by worth your while.
FOREMAN: I've always had a fondness for platinum, specifically in its
liquified state.
ARCHER: I'm afraid we don't carry precious metals on board.
FOREMAN: Pity.
ARCHER: I'm sure there's something else we could offer you.
FOREMAN: (takes a gulp from his breather) I don't make a habit of
allowing people to interrupt my workers, Xindi or otherwise.
ARCHER: (quietly, to Reed) What about the antimatter relays?
REED: Their linings are coated with a platinum-cobalt alloy. Trip could
probably strip them down and separate the metals.
ARCHER: How much platinum are we talking about?
FOREMAN: Well, I'm a reasonable man. I'm sure you could part with, say,
half a litre.
ARCHER: I'd need to see this man, scan him, confirm that he's Xindi.
FOREMAN: That won't be necessary.
(He tosses a cloth to Archer, who opens it to see a severed finger.)
ARCHER: Why would you do this?
FOREMAN: Unfortunate accident. I expect to see you back tomorrow.
(He hits a pipe with a rod and the door opens.)
FOREMAN: Good day.
 [Tucker's
dream - outside]
 YOUNG
TRIP: Elizabeth! Lizzie, you've got to get out of there!
TUCKER: Elizabeth, please! Get out of there!
(He watches helpless as the weapon bears down on her as she sits and
waves at him. He wakes covered in sweat.)
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX:
A blood sample would have sufficed, some saliva.
ARCHER: Is it Xindi?
PHLOX: Yes, and no.
ARCHER: I need something a little more concrete, Doctor.
PHLOX: The genetic profile is nearly identical to the tissue samples
taken from the corpse found on Earth. Their base pair sequencing is far
closer than, say, humans and chimpanzees. Nearly identical, but not
quite.
ARCHER: Like humans and Neanderthals?
PHLOX: A reasonable analogy. After analysing the remains of the Xindi
corpse I was able to provide the computer with enough data to create
this rendering. However, this humanoid is reptilian, that finger is
not. It's covered with skin, not unlike yours or mine, but it's Xindi
all the same. I wish I could be more helpful, Captain.
TUCKER: (enters) Sir.
ARCHER: How's it coming?
TUCKER: We're going to end up stripping more than two hundred relays to
get half a litre of liquified platinum, but you'll have it by this
afternoon.
ARCHER: Let me know when it's ready. You okay?
TUCKER: I'm fine.
(Archer leaves.)
TUCKER: I've got to have something stronger to help me sleep tonight,
Doc.
PHLOX: Very well. Come by at around twenty two hundred hours. I'll see
what I can do.
TUCKER: Thanks.
 [Mine
Foreman's Office]
 TUCKER:
You're aware this stuff is volatile above thirty degrees Celsius.
FOREMAN: I'm familiar with the properties of liquid platinum.
TUCKER: I've insulated the outer container. It should keep everything
pretty stable.
(Archer keeps hold of the container.)
 ARCHER: There's
a little more than a half litre in here.
FOREMAN: What exactly do you want with our Xindi friend? He's not very
attractive, especially after his recent surgery.
ARCHER: I have something to discuss with him.
FOREMAN: And what might that be?
ARCHER: I brought you what you asked for. Now let me see the Xindi. (The Foreman checks on a
computer screen.)
 FOREMAN: His
work group should be awake in about an hour's time.
ARCHER: It took six of my men half the night to extract this platinum.
I think you could wake him an hour early.
 [Mine
Canteen]
 (The
foreman leads the way, Trip holding on to the case with the platinum in
it.)
TUCKER: Is trellium-D the only thing you mine here?
FOREMAN: The only thing. Trellium-D.
TUCKER: I'm not familiar with it. What's it used for?
FOREMAN: Insulation. Mostly for interstellar vessels. What insulation
does your ship use, Captain?
ARCHER: Our outer hull is lined with duranium.
FOREMAN: I imagine you must have a very large crew.
ARCHER: And why would you imagine that?
(A person is thrown to the floor in their midst, and the foreman holds
out his hand for the platinum. Tucker hands over the case.)
FOREMAN: Take your time.
(He leaves with his henchmen. The prisoner has a scarf around his face, but he
looks pretty human.)
KESSICK: Do I have you to thank for this?
(He holds up his hand.)
ARCHER: The foreman said it was an accident.
KESSICK: Did he? What do you want.
ARCHER: You're Xindi?
KESSICK: Nine fingered Xindi. What do you want?
ARCHER: Where's your homeworld?
KESSICK: You came all the way to this hideous planet, bribed the
foreman to see me, for what? Directions to my planet? I find that hard
to believe.
ARCHER: We have important business with your people.
KESSICK: But you don't know where to find them.
(Kessick pulls off the scarf. He
has slight forehead ridges and knobbly bits near the cheekbones.)
KESSICK: Well,
if you want information, you're going to have to help me escape from
this place.
ARCHER: What do you mean, escape?
KESSICK: Do these look like volunteers? We're captives, slaves!
ARCHER: A simple set of coordinates, that's all I want. I'm prepared to
pay you.
KESSICK: The only payment I'm interested in is my freedom. If you can't
provide me with that, stop wasting my time.
TUCKER: I don't know what you're doing in this place and I don't
particularly care, but we didn't come here to stage a prison break so
why don't you just give us the co-ordinates and we'll all stop wasting
each other's kind.
KESSICK: Not until you get me off this planet.
TUCKER: You know, I'm not sure why, but I'm just itching to kick the
hell out of you.
ARCHER: Trip, take it easy. (communicator chirps) Archer here.
T'POL [OC]: Captain.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
There are three warships approaching at warp. Their hull alloys match
the mining towers on the surface.
 [Mine
Canteen]
 ARCHER:
How long before they get here?
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS:
Two hours, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: Go to Tactical Alert. We're heading back to the
shuttlepod.
T'POL: Understood.
 [Mine
Canteen]
KESSICK: Shuttlepod? You have a starship in orbit? You've made it so
easy for them. Usually they have to go out and find ships to replenish
their labour force. (Archer and Tucker find the door is now locked) You
flew right into their trap.
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise. Enterprise, respond. (static)
KESSICK: You might consider waiting for your colleagues to rescue you,
but it sounds like they're about to become quite busy. If you have a
shuttlepod on the surface I can get you to it, but you'll have to take
me with you.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI:
There's an audio message coming in from the mine foreman.
T'POL: This is Enterprise.
FOREMAN [OC]: I'm afraid your Captain
 [Mine
Foreman's Office]
FOREMAN: And his associate are going to be slightly delayed. We have
three cargo vessels approaching, and we've had
 [Bridge]
 FOREMAN
[OC]: To begin de-ionising our landing decks.
T'POL: How long a delay?
 [Mine
Foreman's Office]
FOREMAN: No more than an hour.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
We've detected your cargo ships. They're heavily armed.
 [Mine
Foreman's Office]
FOREMAN: Trellium-D is a highly
 [Bridge]
 FOREMAN
[OC]: Valued substance, and I'm certain you've noticed that this is not
one of the friendlier regions of space.
T'POL: Can I talk to Captain Archer?
 [Mine
Foreman's Office]
FOREMAN: Not at the moment. He requested to speak to a miner who
resides on level twenty two.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
I spoke with him a few minutes ago.
FOREMAN [OC]: The de-ionising process prevents us with communicating
with the lower levels. I'll have him
 [Mine
Foreman's Office]
FOREMAN: contact you as soon as he returns.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
Keep trying to reach the Captain.
REED: Something doesn't smell right.
T'POL: I want you to come up with a plan to recover the Captain and
Commander Tucker. Have it in place in one hour. Get Major Hayes to help
you.
 [Mining
complex sewage system]
 ARCHER:
Sewage takes on a whole new meaning when it comes from a dozen
different species.
KESSICK: Thirty one, to be exact. Help me with this. There's a lever
below your knees. Pull it up.
(Archer helps turn the wheel as Trip reaches down for the lever. The
access door opens.)
KESSICK: Plasma duct thirteen hasn't been used since I've been here.
TUCKER: Why is there a hatch here?
KESSICK: There's one every eight levels.
ARCHER: What are you doing?
KESSICK: (working another lever) Opening the emergency baffle up there.
It's a steel plate that locks into place during maintenance cycles.
Follow me.
(He leads them up the ladder, Archer following, then Tucker in the
rear.)
 [Armoury]
 HAYES:
Looks a little close to the mine, but I suppose it'll be all right.
REED: The ionised particles will cover our descent. It'll be all right.
(T'Pol enters.)
REED: Have you heard from the Captain?
T'POL: Not yet. The foreman isn't responding to our hails.
REED: The ships?
T'POL: Less than an hour away. Are you ready?
REED: They're armed to the teeth down there, but it is do-able. We only
have one bone of contention. The Major here thinks my security team is
far to valuable to bring down and put in the line of fire. He wants to
take his men.
HAYES: It's a simple matter of priorities. If those warships get here
before we return from the surface, you could find yourselves dealing
with a boarding party. You'd be in far better hands with a security
force who knows Enterprise inside and out.
REED: I plan to have my men back on board with the Captain and Trip
long before those ships arrive.
HAYES: With all due respect, sir, we can't be certain of that.
T'POL: The decision is yours, Lieutenant, but I agree with Major Hayes.
Your team may not be back in time.
REED: Select six of your men and meet me in launch bay one. I'll be
commanding the mission.
HAYES: Very good, sir.
(Hayes leaves.)
REED: Coming from a military family, I've seen men like Hayes all my
life.
T'POL: Lieutenant?
REED: That had nothing to do with who knows Enterprise inside and out.
It had to do with who the Major thinks is more capable of carrying out
this rescue.
 [Mine
Foreman's office]
 GUARD:
They're gone, all three of them.
FOREMAN: That's impossible.
GUARD: We've searched the entire cell perimeter.
FOREMAN: Post guards at their landing craft. If they get back to their
starship I'll lose nearly a hundred new workers.
 [Plasma
duct thirteen]
 ARCHER:
If this leads to the surface why didn't you use it before?
KESSICK: The residue in the atmosphere is at least thirty times more
toxic than it is down here. This is the first time I've had the luxury
of a ship waiting for me.
 [Shuttlepod]
 REED:
The lower levels are hyper-saturated with ionised particles, so you'll
have to get within a hundred metres to pick up their biosigns.
TRAVIS: We've got less than a half an hour to do it.
 [Mine
Foreman's office]
(The
Foreman points to a graphic display.)
FOREMAN: Duct thirteen. They've opened two emergency baffles.
GUARD: They're nearly to the surface. We should destroy their landing
pod.
FOREMAN: No, too valuable. How long would it take to redirect the
plasma flow into that conduit?
GUARD: I'll see to it.
 [Plasma
duct thirteen]
KESSICK: You've risked your lives to learn where my homeworld is,
because you say you have important business with my people? Which
species? Have you ever even met a Xindi before today?
ARCHER: One, and he didn't look very much like you.
KESSICK: Not all of them do. There are five distinct species of Xindi,
and five distinct opinions on which one is dominant.
(Something clangs in the duct.)
TUCKER: What was that?
(Another clang.)
 ARCHER: That
sounded an awful lot like those emergency baffles we opened.
TUCKER: Why would they open the rest? They'll just help us escape
ARCHER: I thought you said this duct isn't used anymore.
KESSICK: It isn't. They've obviously re-routed the plasma.
ARCHER: How far up to the next maintenance hatch? How far?
KESSICK: I don't know.
TUCKER: I think the safest bet is to head back down to the last one.
ARCHER: I think you're right.
KESSICK: That's where the plasma's coming from! We should go up.
ARCHER: Suit yourself.
(He starts down.)
KESSICK: It's too late. We'll be killed.
TUCKER: Shut up. Just shut up.
ARCHER: We're going to have to pick up the pace, gentleman.
(A red glow is visible in the duct. They slide down.)
 [Passageway]
 TUCKER:
Wait a minute!
KESSICK: Get out of my way.
TUCKER: What the hell?
(They get to safety and shut the hatch just in time.)
TUCKER: You stupid son of a bitch. I ought to open this hatch and throw
you down into
(He sees the guards waiting for them.)
KESSICK: They forced me to come with them. They said they'd kill me if
I didn't. Just now, this one, he tried to throw me into the plasma.
Said they didn't need me any more. Thank you, thank you. If you hadn't
been waiting here I don't know what I
(The guard knocks him down.)
GUARD: Pick him up.
 [Mine

FOREMAN: I'd have preferred having you join your crewmembers as new
additions to my workforce, but you've turned out to be more trouble
than you're worth. Select a detail. Take them to the surface. Shoot all
three of them.
(Rnter the MACOs, sliding down ropes and shooting. There's a tussle as
Archer and Tucker get guns from prone guards and join in the battle.
Kessick crawls away and hides under the stairs.)
ARCHER: You okay?
KEMPER: Yes, sir.
(Corporal Cole gives a masterclass in using nightstick to disarm and
render an assailant helpless.)
TUCKER: Nice shot.
(There's an explosion.)
REED: Captain! It took a little doing, sir, but we got through the
outer hatch.
(Archer grabs Kessick.)
 ARCHER: Where
the hell do you think you're going?
KESSICK: You promised to take me away from here.
TUCKER: That was before your little performance back there.
KESSICK: No, please, you have to help me!
ARCHER: You had your chance.
KESSICK: The coordinates of my homeworld. If you want them you'll have
to take me with you.
ARCHER: You're lying.
KESSICK: No, I promise you.
 [Planet

 REED:
Reed to Mayweather.
TRAVIS [OC]: Go ahead.
REED: We've got them. Lock onto my location and set down.
TRAVIS [OC]: Understood.
(There's weapons fire coming from the dark. Kessick is shot in the
back.)
HAYES: Fayette, go.
(The MACO sets up his night scope and shoots the Foreman between the
eyes. The second shuttlepod appears out of the gloom.)
TUCKER: Captain?
(Archer checks Kessick, then they carry him off to the second pod.)
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI:
Both shuttlepods have left the surface.
T'POL: Is everybody aboard?
HOSHI: Everybody plus one.
T'POL: The warships?
HOSHI: Still at warp four. ETA approximately seven minutes.
T'POL: Tell the pods to dock simultaneously. Prepare to go to maximum
warp.
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. The three alien warships followed
Enterprise for nearly an hour, but couldn't keep up with us. I guess
they'll have to look elsewhere for new additions to their labour force.
 [Ready
room]
 ARCHER:
Come in.
PHLOX: I'm terribly sorry, Captain, but there was nothing I could do. I
realise how important it would have been to have a Xindi to help us.
ARCHER: He wasn't a particularly helpful Xindi, Doctor.
PHLOX: You'd be surprised. It was extremely difficult and painful for
him to speak, but he managed to dictate this to me before he died. He
said you'd know what it meant.
ARCHER: I'll be damned. They're the coordinates.
 [Corridor]
 TUCKER:
I must have been in the shower for two hours and I still had that crap
in my hair and under my nails.
REED: We cleared bioscan, that's all that matters.
TUCKER: Yeah. The two new guys that got hurt, are they okay?
REED: The Doctor's got them back in their quarters already.
TUCKER: You've got to admit, their team did a pretty impressive job
down there. Nothing your guys couldn't have done just as well.
REED: I'm not so sure about that. See you in the morning.
TUCKER: All right.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX:
How are you feeling, Commander?
TUCKER: Tired. You said you'd give me something to sleep?
PHLOX: Very well.
(Phlox injects him.)
PHLOX: If you wouldn't mind, Commander. I promised T'Pol I'd take these
bioscans to her quarters, but I still have quite a bit of work to do
here.
TUCKER: No problem, Doc. Thanks.
(Tucker leaves.)
PHLOX: Sickbay to T'Pol.
T'POL [OC]: Yes, Doctor.
PHLOX: Commander Tucker is on his way to your quarters. He believes I
just gave him a sedative, but it was only a placebo. He's had a rather
difficult day. I believe you have your work cut out for you.
 [T'Pol's
quarters]
 TUCKER:
Sorry to drop by so late, but Phlox said you were expecting this.
T'POL: Thank you. Please, sit down.
TUCKER: I don't think I'd be very good company right now. Anyway, I
still have a few more showers to take before I get all this trellium-D
off me.
T'POL: Would you like a cup of tea?
TUCKER: Thanks, but it might keep me up. The Doctor just gave me a
sedative.
T'POL: You are having trouble sleeping as well.
TUCKER: I never would have pegged you for an insomniac.
T'POL: I believe the Expanse has been disrupting my REM patterns.
TUCKER: Probably nothing a good hypospray couldn't cure.
T'POL: Vulcan science teaches us to prompt our bodies to create their
own medicines.
TUCKER: So why are you still having trouble sleeping?
T'POL: The neural nodes that need to be stimulated are difficult to
reach. Perhaps you could help me.
(She slips off her dressing gown to reveal a pair of pajamas that don't
meet in the middle.)
TUCKER: I don't really know if I can
T'POL: Three centimetres on either side of the fifth vertebrae.
(Tucker puts his hands on her back as she takes off her top.)
T'POL: You can apply considerable pressure.
TUCKER: I'm not sure which of these is
T'POL: Right there.
TUCKER: Right here?
T'POL: A little closer together. Harder. Harder.
TUCKER: If I push any harder I'll knock you over.
T'POL: Just like that. Please continue. Ahhh. That was far more
effective than a hypospray.
(Tucker pats her leg as she puts her top back on.)
 TUCKER: Glad to
be of assistance.
T'POL: It would be only fair for me to return the favour. Please,
disrobe.
TUCKER: I'm really flattered, Sub-Commander, and don't think under
different circumstances I wouldn't jump at the chance
T'POL: Are you implying I'm making sexual advances?
TUCKER: No. No, no, no, not at all. I, I was just. You see, the Doctor
gave me this sedative and I think it's starting to work.
T'POL: The Doctor injected you with a placebo. He sent you here because
he wanted me to persuade you to try Vulcan neuro-pressure. As I
predicted, it was a pointless exercise.
TUCKER: Why didn't he just ask me?
T'POL: He did. You refused.
TUCKER: Oh, so this whole thing was just a set up.
T'POL: The Doctor knows how intransigent you can be.
TUCKER: Intransigent!
T'POL: Unwilling to compromise.
TUCKER: I know what it means, but it just so happens it's not true. I'm
as willing to compromise as anyone else.
T'POL: Then take off your shirt.
(He does, and they begin.)
 [Bridge]
(There's a bright dot in the middle of the viewscreen, just like when
they approached Earth.)
TRAVIS: Sir, we're approaching the coordinates.
ARCHER: Tactical Alert. Stand by weapons. Any indications that we're
being scanned?
REED: No, sir. No vessels, no signs of technology, nothing.
ARCHER: How many inhabited planets?
T'POL: I'm not detecting any planets, inhabited or otherwise.
ARCHER: Son of a bitch lied to us.
TUCKER: Phlox said the Xindi used his dying breath to give us these
coordinates. Why would he lie?
TRAVIS: Sir, I'm picking up a debris field.
ARCHER: A ship?
TRAVIS: It's a lot bigger than that.
ARCHER: Put it up.
T'POL: It's nearly eighty million kilometres long. It was a planet.
ARCHER: Move us in closer.
(They fly in amongst the lumps of rock.)
ARCHER: How long ago did this happen?
T'POL: Judging by the field dispersion, approximately one hundred and
twenty years.
TUCKER: I'm pretty sure there was a population here, Captain. I'm
picking up refined metals and traces of alloys. Some of them match the
hull of the Xindi probe.
ARCHER: They're building a weapon, planning to annihilate Earth because
they think we're going to destroy their world in four hundred years.
How is that possible if their world doesn't exist anymore, hasn't
existed for decades.
T'POL: We know the probe that attacked Earth was built somewhere in
this Expanse, and it was built recently. It's logical to assume the new
weapon is being developed at the same location.
TUCKER: But, if it's not here
ARCHER: Prepare to go to warp four.
TRAVIS: What course, sir?
ARCHER: Deeper into the Expanse.
REED: Long range sensors are showing increasing numbers of spatial
distortions.
ARCHER: You heard me, Travis.
 [Xindi
Council]
REPTILIAN: They scanned the debris and left nearly three hours ago.
HUMANOID: Their heading?
REPTILIAN: Toward the Orassin distortion fields.
ARBOREAL: Then it's unlikely they'll survive.
INSECTOID: We can't assume that. I'm sending vessels to destroy them.
DEGRA: If they are the first wave of an invasion it would be best for
us to remain hidden. Let them keep searching.
AQUATIC: He's correct. They won't find what they're looking for.
INSECTOID: Finish the weapon quickly, or I'll destroy the Earth ship
whether this Council approves or not.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Anomaly
Anomaly
Original Airdate: 17 September, 2003
  [Ready room]
(Porthos is uneasy, and howls.)
ARCHER: Come here.
(The little dog runs over to him.)
ARCHER: What's the problem?
(He picks up a book from the floor.)
 [Engineering]
CREWMAN: Commander?
TUCKER: This can't be right. Did you run a diagnostic?
CREWMAN: Twice.
TUCKER: Let's check those relays. (In
Sickbay, the animals are restless. In the Mess hall, food is leaping up
to the ceiling. A corridor floor flexes and knocks two crewmen over.)
 [Ready
room]
(Archer's desk ripples, the coffee cup leaps into the air and just
floats there.)
T'POL [OC]: Captain to the Bridge.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
We're getting reports of anomalies from all over the ship.
TRAVIS: The warp field's fluctuating.
 [Engineering]
 (There
are streams of energy coming from the warp engine)
ARCHER [OC]: Bridge to Engineering. Report.
TUCKER: I don't get it, Captain. Half the plasma relays have reversed
polarity.
ARCHER [OC]: Shut down the reactor.
TUCKER: I'm trying, but it's not cooperating.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS:
We're losing main power.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER:
Now. (Controls are thrown, Enterprise goes into darkness and drops out
of warp with the nacelles stuttering.)
 [Bridge]
 REED:
I've restored emergency power, but of our primary systems are still
offline, including weapons.
ARCHER: Trip, what's your status?
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER:
We've got a hell of a mess down here, Captain. It's going to be a while
before I can even figure out what just happened.
ARCHER [OC]: Keep me posted.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS:
Sir, I'm picking up a vessel eight million kilometres off port.
ARCHER: What's their heading?
TRAVIS: Looks like they're holding position, or they could be adrift.
ARCHER: Hail them.
HOSHI: Our transceiver's offline.
ARCHER: What's our best speed?
TRAVIS: One quarter impulse.
ARCHER: Set a course.
(Enterprise tiptoes slowly toward the alien ship.)
ARCHER: Biosigns?
T'POL: None, and there's no atmosphere aboard. Artificial gravity's
down as well.
ARCHER: Any sign of what happened to them?
REED: No, sir.
 [Locker
room]
(Archer, Reed and some MACO's are getting into EV suits.)
ARCHER: Have you spent much time in gravity boots, Corporal?
MCKENZIE: I did a six week tour on Jupiter Station. The grav-plating
went down a few times.
KEMPER: Only in simulation, sir.
HAWKINS: Same here, Captain.
ARCHER: This is an alien ship we're boarding. We could run into
magnetic variances. Watch your step.
ALL: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: We're looking for anything that could tell us what happened to
them.
REED: And don't forget, just because sensors didn't pick up any
biosigns doesn't mean you won't encounter anyone.
ARCHER: Set weapons to stun.
MCKENZIE: Aye sir.
 [Alien
ship]
 (The
group clomp along as boots and small pieces of equipment float in the
zero gravity. Reed scans scorch marks on the wall.)
REED: Weapons fire. (Kemper opens a door and seeing a corpse.)
KEMPER: Captain? (scans it) No
external injuries.
ARCHER: Let's find the Bridge.
 [Alien
Bridge]
(McKenzie leads the way. There are more corpses floating around here.)
ARCHER: (to Reed) Try to access that station. Download what you can.
 [Locker
room]
 ARCHER:
We counted seventeen bodies. Most of them died when their life support
ran out. The others were killed by particle weapons. What's our status?
T'POL: Ensign Sato managed to bring the transceiver online, but other
than that.
ARCHER: Archer to Mayweather.
TRAVIS [OC]: Go ahead, Captain.
ARCHER: Resume our previous course, one quarter impulse.
TRAVIS [OC]: Understood.
T'POL: It might be best to complete repairs before we head deeper into
the Expanse. If we encounter any more anomalies
ARCHER: Those people have been dead for less than two days. Whoever
attacked them could still be nearby. We'll have to make repairs on the
move. Mister Reed recovered some data from their Bridge. See what you
can make of it.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER:
Let's try it again. Watch that intermix ratio. (The warp engine starts
to hum.) TUCKER: Looking good. Bring her up to forty percent. (Energy arcs flash
out again.) TUCKER: Shut it down. Shut it down!
ARCHER: How's it coming?
TUCKER: Could be better. Creating a stable warp field isn't easy when
the laws of physics won't cooperate. The Cochrane Equation, it's not
constant here. The problem's in the quantum variables. Every time I try
to compensate, the spatial gradients get thrown out of whack. Either we
get away from these anomalies or we're going to have to rewrite the
book on warp theory, and I don't have to tell you how long it took
Zefram Cochrane the first time around.
ARCHER: What about tactical systems?
TUCKER: Weapons should be up and running within an hour or two.
ARCHER: Make them your priority.
TUCKER: You worried about something?
ARCHER: Weapons, Trip. As quickly as you can. (Archer leaves.)
TUCKER: Now where's Isaac Newton when you need him.
(In his ready room, Archer snatches the still-suspended mug out of
mid-air and slams it down on the desk. The coffee carries on floating.)
 [Bridge]
 (A
different type of alien ship is approaching.)
ARCHER: Distance?
TRAVIS: Three thousand metres and closing.
REED: They're charging weapons.
ARCHER: Can you give me hull plating?
REED: I'm sorry, sir.
ARCHER: Hail them.
TRAVIS: Two thousand metres.
 [Armoury]
 (Several humanoid aliens with ponytails beam on board and start
transporting equipment away from Engineering and a Cargo bay. Reed,
Archer and two MACOs put up a bit of a gunfight.)
ARCHER: Hold your fire. Are those warheads armed?
REED: Yeah.
ARCHER: (to Hawkins) Stun grenade. (Too late, the enemy beam out with
the spoils.) ARCHER: Go! How many more?
REED: (checking internal sensors) Two in Cargo Bay one, four more in
Engineering.
ARCHER: Get down there and help Trip. Corporal.
REED: Woods, you're with me.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI:
They're trying to download our database.
T'POL: Lock them out.
(In Engineering, Trip knocks one alien out with a piece of piping, then
as the others start shooting at him, he makes the engines arc to keep
the others away. Just as Reed gets there and starts shooting, they beam
away and Trip turns off the engine again. Archer and Hawkins burst into
an completely empty Cargo bay. The alien ship leaves.)
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX:
Increase his anaprovaline by fifty milligrams.
ARCHER: How are they?
PHLOX: Stable. However, they've suffered extensive disruptor burns. I'd
like to start them on regeneration therapy, but the Imaging Chamber was
damaged in the attack. I'll need a repair team as soon as possible.
ARCHER: Understood. (Archer pulls back the curtain on a bed with a dead
crewman on it.)
PHLOX: Crewman Fuller. I did everything I could.
ARCHER: What about him? (The alien that Trip knocked out.)
PHLOX: A few internal injuries. I'll need to keep him under
observation.
ARCHER: You can observe him in the Brig. See to it.
KEMPER: Aye sir.
PHLOX: You might be interested to know that I recognise his species.
He's Osaarian.
ARCHER: He's not from the Expanse?
PHLOX: Not originally. (Tucker opens the door, and Archer goes outside
to walk and talk with him.)
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER:
How bad is it?
TUCKER: They made off with three photonic torpedoes, a case of plasma
rifles, two dozen stun grenades, Chef says they cleaned out half of the
food stores, Cargo Bay two's been stripped to the bulkheads, but that's
not the worst of it. They took every one of our antimatter storage
pods. All we've got left is what's in the main reactor.
ARCHER: How long will that last, a month?
TUCKER: Tops. After that we're out of gas.
 [Ready
room]
 ARCHER:
This is all you've got?
T'POL: High Command hasn't had much contact with the Osaarians. They
have a large merchant fleet, but there's no record of piracy.
ARCHER: Any luck tracking their ship?
T'POL: Not yet. They've found a way to mask their ion trail.
ARCHER: For a people with no history of piracy, they've gotten pretty
good at it. Keep looking.
T'POL: It appears they've adapted their weapons and engines to
compensate for the anomalies. Pursuing them will be dangerous. We
should consider other alternatives.
ARCHER: Such as what? Waiting for our antimatter to run dry?
T'POL: I'm only suggesting that we may be able to replenish our
supplies elsewhere.
ARCHER: Keep looking.
 [Brig]
 ARCHER:
(to guard outside) Open it. (He goes in and talks to the prisoner through
the intercom.) ARCHER: Doctor Phlox said your injuries were minor. Please get
up.
ORGOTH: Why?
ARCHER: I have a dead crewman.
ORGOTH: I didn't kill him.
ARCHER: No, one of your friends did. But I don't have one of your
friends, I have you, so get up and look at me. (he does. His face is
scarred and twisted) Thank you. You're going to help me find your ship,
and after I've taken back what they stole from me, you and your
colleagues are free to go.
ORGOTH: If you went anywhere near that ship you'd have more than one
dead crewman. I can't help you. Even if I could, my Captain wouldnn't
be very interested in having me back, would he. Not after I told you
where to find him.
ARCHER: That's a risk you'll have to take, because the alternative is
going to be a lot less pleasant.
ORGOTH: I don't think you'd be very comfortable torturing another man.
You and your crewmates are far too civilised for that. Too moral.
ARCHER: I need what was stolen from me. There's too much at stake to
let my morality get in the way.
ORGOTH: You're obviously new to this Expanse. If you weren't, your
ship's hull would be insulated with trellium-D. Do you have any idea
what a spatial distortion can do to a ship that is not insulated with
trellium-D? What it can do to the people inside that ship?
ARCHER: You masked your ion trail. How?
ORGOTH: Well, my Captain's a very clever man. He has to be. When you're
forced to resort to desperate measures in order to survive, you have to
be clever. You need to know how to hide.
ARCHER: So you were forced into piracy.
ORGOTH: When we entered this Expanse we were no different than you. Two
merchant ships looking for trade routes. Then the first distortion hit
us. We decided to return home, but the perimeter, the thermobaric
clouds, let you in but they don't let you out. One of our ships was
destroyed trying. After a few more encounters with the anomalies it
wasn't long before we became predators. This section of the Expanse
proved to be ideal for hunting. When a ship runs aground due to spatial
distortions it becomes an easy target. Our Captain told us we wouldn't
harm anyone, and we didn't. Not at first. It takes time to learn to
kill without remorse. You're not prepared to kill, or torture. Not yet.
ARCHER: I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to find your ship, and if
that ends up causing me remorse, then it's something I'm willing to
live with. Think about it.
 [Command
centre]
 T'POL:
I've been studying the data
recovered from the derelict. Apparently, they decided to look for the
Osaarians as well. They found a way to modify their sensors to detect
the ion trail. Their life support failed before they had a chance to
start.
ARCHER: Did they leave a record of the modifications?
T'POL: I've already given it to Ensign Mayweather.
ARCHER: What's our tactical situation.
T'POL: Hull plating's back online. We should have phase cannons within
the hour.
ARCHER: Torpedoes?
T'POL: Lieutenant Reed is still having difficulty modifying the
guidance systems to compensate for the anomalies.
ARCHER: I'll be in the Armoury.
 [Mess
hall]
 (Tucker
is at a table pouring over four PADDs when Reed comes in to get a
drink.)
REED: Black tea, hot. You finished rewriting the physics books?
TUCKER: I don't think I'll be taking home a Nobel prize anytime soon.
REED: A few hours rest might do you a world of good.
TUCKER: No kidding.
REED: You still can't sleep?
TUCKER: T'Pol's been trying to help, showing me how to stimulate my
neural nodes. It's not what you think.
REED: I wasn't thinking anything.
TUCKER: How are the weapons coming?
REED: The Captain and I managed to bring the guidance systems online,
but we're going to need more time for the aft launchers. Fuller knew
those torpedo systems better than anyone. He won't be easy to replace.
Considering all the hostile aliens we've met, I suppose it's fortunate
we haven't lost more people.
TUCKER: I doubt he'll be the last.
REED: There's no reason to get cynical.
TUCKER: Every species we run into seems to be gunning for us. We might
as well paint a giant bulls-eye on the hull.
REED: What do you suggest we do, turn around and go back to Earth?
TUCKER: All I'm saying is that this mission, whether it succeeds or
not, is looking like a one-way ticket all the time.
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've been tracking the Osaarians' ion
trail for the past four hours. There's still no sign of them.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS:
The trail ends about twenty thousand kilometres ahead.
ARCHER: Any sign of a ship?
TRAVIS: Nothing.
ARCHER: T'Pol?
T'POL: Curious. The trail resumes after another seventy thousand
kilometres.
ARCHER: Let's see it. (Hoshi puts a schematic on the viewscreen)
TRAVIS: Shall I alter course?
ARCHER: Not yet. Why would there be such a large gap?
T'POL: Their ions may have been dispersed by stellar winds.
HOSHI: There would still be some residual particles.
REED: Captain, the particle decay rates don't match. This one is at
least nine hours old, this one was left less than an hour ago.
ARCHER: Bring weapons online. Take us to where the first trail ends.
(As they move on, the ship shakes.) ARCHER: Travis?
TRAVIS: I'm not reading anything.
(The lights flicker, then we see Enterprise vanish as it crosses an
invisible threshold.)
REED: Power's fluctuating. Forward plating's down.
T'POL: Microfractures are forming on the outer hull. We should come
about.
ARCHER: Keep going. (Flashes, bangs, ripple effects, then the ship
reappears and a spherical structure is seen on the viewscreen.) ARCHER: T'Pol.
T'POL: It's approximately nineteen kilometres in diameter.
ARCHER: Ever seen anything like it?
T'POL: No. It's constructed entirely of a single alloy.
REED: Who could build something that big?
ARCHER: Take us in closer.
REED: That cloaking field is enormous. Whoever built this thing went to
a great deal of trouble to conceal it.
ARCHER: Judging from those ion trails, the Osaarians spent over eight
hours here. I want to find out why. Any luck scanning the interior?
T'POL: Our sensors are being deflected.
ARCHER: See if you can find something that looks like a way in. Take us
into orbit.
T'POL: I'm detecting what appears to be a portal, twenty two degrees
north of our current position.
ARCHER: Put it up. (A pair of sliding doors come into view.) ARCHER: Can you
tell what the door's made of?
T'POL: Polyduranium. The same metal as the Osaarian's hull.
ARCHER: Can we fit through?
TRAVIS: Not with Enterprise.
ARCHER: Then get a pod ready.
 [Shuttlepod]
 (The
pod launches with Travis, Reed, Archer and 3 MACOs, and comes to a halt
just in front of the doors.)
REED: We've cycled through the standard frequencies.
ARCHER: Did you find the locking mechanism?
REED: On the lower right side.
ARCHER: Hold our position. (He fires the phase cannon at it.) ARCHER: Try it now.
(The doors slide open to reveal a lit interior.)
TRAVIS: There's no indication of any ships, sir.
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise.
T'POL [OC]: Go ahead.
ARCHER: We're heading in.
T'POL [OC]: Understood.
(The pod flies into the massive hollow interior.)
TRAVIS: There's enough energy running through here to power a dozen
cities.
REED: What's that down there?
ARCHER: Those modules have a breathable atmosphere.
REED: Let's hope there's no one home.
ARCHER: Do you see that docking port, Ensign?
TRAVIS: Yes, sir.
 [Module]
(Reed cuts through the door with his phase pistol to get them
inside.)
REED: We're all clear, sir.
ARCHER: They've been busy. We've a lot of modules to search. Fan out,
keep open comm. links.
REED: They're not going to run out of stem-bolts any time soon. This
way. Starfleet ration packs. (Archer takes out his anger on the stacked contraband until his
communicator chirps.)
ARCHER: Archer.
TRAVIS [OC]: I've found something, Captain.
(He goes to join Travis.)
ARCHER: Travis?
TRAVIS: Over here, sir. (Travis lights up a computer screen.) TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure
it's a cargo manifest.
ARCHER: How's your Osaarian?
TRAVIS: Not very good, sir.
ARCHER: Download what you can. Get it to Hoshi. Tell T'Pol we're going
to need another search team.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
REED: Check behind those canisters.
(Meanwhile, Hoshi is in the Situation room, working on translating the
manifest.)
TRAVIS: Look at this. (They've found the missing injectors. Recovered items are transported aboard Enterprise and put back where
they came from.)
 [Sickbay]
 (Phlox
is checking his now-working Imaging Chamber when Tucker comes in holding
his wrist.)
PHLOX: Commander.
TUCKER: I had a little accident, Doc. I was reinstalling the deuterium
injectors. One of them must have had a little juice left in it.
PHLOX: Second degree burn. Why don't you have a seat.
TUCKER: I could have sworn that injector was depolarised. I guess I'm
getting a little punchy.
PHLOX: When's the last time you slept?
TUCKER: I got a full hour last night.
PHLOX: I'm surprised the neuro-pressure isn't helping. T'Pol told me
your first treatment went well.
TUCKER: Well, we only had the one session. Haven't had a lot of free
time lately.
PHLOX: Are you certain that's the reason?
TUCKER: What do you mean?
PHLOX: Vulcan neuro-pressure requires a certain degree of intimacy. I
can understand that it might make you uncomfortable.
TUCKER: It doesn't make me uncomfortable. I just can't afford to spend
an hour every night in T'Pol's quarters. Can you just give me another
one of those injections? They put me out like a light.
PHLOX: They're not meant to be taken for extended periods. There is
another treatment that might be helpful.
TUCKER: All right, what have you got?
PHLOX: Aldebaran mud leeches.
TUCKER: What am I supposed to do with them?
PHLOX: Place one on your chest and one on your abdomen an hour before
going to bed. Their secretions act as a natural sedative. Oh, please be
careful to sleep on your back. If you roll over, you might anger them.
TUCKER: Maybe an hour a night with T'Pol isn't so bad.
 [Ready
room]
 T'POL:
The search teams have found nearly eighty percent of our antimatter.
They're looking for the rest.
ARCHER: It's probably running through the reactor of that Osaarian
ship.
T'POL: We've also recovered most of our weapons.
ARCHER: How's Trip doing?
T'POL: He'll have warp drive online within the next thirty minutes.
ARCHER: Have the away teams speed it up. I want to go to warp as soon
as they're back.
T'POL: Quantum scans indicate it's nearly a thousand years old.
ARCHER: What else?
T'POL: The structure contains seven fusion reactors. Each one is almost
twelve kilometres long. Only three are still operational.
ARCHER: Any idea what they were designed for?
T'POL: The sphere's emitting massive amounts of gravimetric energy. It
may have something to do with the spatial anomalies.
ARCHER: Take as many scans as you can.
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
HOSHI [OC] Sir, could you come to the Situation Room?
 [Situation
room]
 HOSHI:
While I was translating the cargo manifest, something caught my eye.
Look at these markings. I had to double-check, but I was pretty sure
that I had seen this ideography before. This is a piece of the Xindi
probe that crashed on Earth. At least three of the symbols are an exact
match.
 [Brig]
 ARCHER:
Your ship attacked a Xindi vessel. I want to know everything you can
tell me about them. (Orgoth is lying on the bunk.)
ORGOTH: Xindi?
ARCHER: You heard me.
ORGOTH: I don't remember a species with that name.
ARCHER: You're lying. Your manifest said you took their ship less than
two weeks ago.
ORGOTH: What manifest?
ARCHER: Tell me what you know.
ORGOTH: It was a small ship, they were no match for us.
ARCHER: Where are they now? (Orgoth looks at him and snorts
disdainfully.) ARCHER: You destroyed them?
ORGOTH: They resisted. We had no choice.
ARCHER: Where did they come from?
ORGOTH: I have better things to do than familiarise myself with our
victims.
ARCHER: Which species of Xindi were they? What did they look like?
ORGOTH: I don't remember. (Archer opens the cell door and holds his phase pistol to Orgoth's head.)
ARCHER: Are you sure?
ORGOTH: Your threats aren't very convincing. I told you, you're too
civilised.
ARCHER: We'll see about that. (Archer marches him out of cell.)
GUARD: Sir!
ARCHER: As you were.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER:
(passing a woman) Ensign.
ORGOTH: Are you taking me to your torture chamber?
ARCHER: Shut up. (Archer opens an airlock.) ARCHER: Get in. (He pushes Orgoth in and closes
the airlock.) ARCHER: The Xindi.
ORGOTH: This tactic doesn't suit you, Captain.
ARCHER: This airlock has a decompression rate of point five atmospheres
per minute. (Orgoth folds his arms so Archer goes to the control panel.)
ARCHER: You'd better start talking now, because in about forty seconds you
won't be able to. The Xindi. (Reed arrives with a security guard.)
REED: Captain?
ARCHER: Everything's under control, Lieutenant.
REED: The airlock's decompressing, sir. He'll die.
ARCHER: Not for another twenty seconds he won't. The Xindi.
REED: Sir.
ARCHER: Your memory getting any better? (Orgoth nods) Say again?
REED: Captain! (Orgoth drops to his knees, Archer opens the door and
lets him crawl out.)
ARCHER: Take him back to the Brig.
REED: Let's go. (Reed and the guard haul Orgoth away.)
 [Situation
room]
 T'POL:
Was he cooperative?
ARCHER: Eventually. When they attacked the Xindi ship they took more
than fuel and supplies. They downloaded their database. How close would
we have to get to tap into their main computer?
HOSHI: Pretty close. Less than a kilometre, but we need to have the
access codes.
ARCHER: He gave them to me. Here.
T'POL: They are heavily armed. Are you sure it's wise to engage them?
ARCHER: I want that database. Go to Tactical Alert. Tell Trip we're
going to need all the power he can spare for weapons and hull plating.
TRAVIS: Their ion trail's already started to decay. They're going to be
hard to find.
ARCHER: We're going to wait for them to find us, Travis.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS:
Something's passing through the cloaking field.
ARCHER: Move us into position. (to Reed) Stand by. Have they detected
us?
T'POL: Not yet.
(As the Osaarian ship becomes visible, it gets hit by two torpedoes,
then another.)
ARCHER: Open a channel.
HOSHI: Go ahead.
ARCHER: This is Captain Archer. Remember us? You probably noticed that
our weapons are back online. You're outgunned, so stand down.
(Enterprise is hit by weapons fire)
TRAVIS: They're moving off.
ARCHER: One kilometre, Travis. (to Hoshi) Get ready.
REED: Hull plating's holding.
TRAVIS: They're heading back into the cloaking field.
ARCHER: Stay with them. (Both ships disappear into the field.) ARCHER: Hoshi?
HOSHI: We're not close enough.
TRAVIS: Stand by.
HOSHI: Another fifty metres. I'm into the computer.
T'POL: Anything?
HOSHI: I haven't found the Xindi database. I'm losing them.
ARCHER: Travis! (The data display comes back.)
T'POL: Forward hull plating is offline.
HOSHI: I've found it, Captain.
ARCHER: How long do you need?
HOSHI: A few minutes.
T'POL: Hull fracture on E deck, section fourteen. We're venting
atmosphere.
ARCHER: Emergency bulkheads.
HOSHI: They're getting too far away. I'm losing the comm. link again.
TRAVIS: Our impulse drive's destabilising. We've got to get out of the
cloaking field, sir.
ARCHER: Head back to the sphere. (Enterprise re-emerges.) ARCHER: Where are
they?
TRAVIS: Still inside the field.
ARCHER: How much did you get?
HOSHI: About a third of it.
ARCHER: Take us closer to that portal. Let's see if we can lure them
back in here. Use our forward phase cannon. Fire a single burst,
minimum yield. (They blast a hole in the middle of the doors.) ARCHER: Travis?
TRAVIS: No sign of them.
ARCHER: Again. (Two phase cannons blow the entrance apart.)
TRAVIS: That got their attention. They're coming through.
ARCHER: Stay within a kilometre. Return fire.
HOSHI: I'm back in.
ARCHER: Can you take out their engines?
REED: Not without risking damage to their main computer.
ARCHER: Ensign.
HOSHI: I've got eighty percent, eighty five.
T'POL: Hull plating's offline. They're targeting our reactor.
HOSHI: I've got ninety percent.
ARCHER: Good enough. Mister Reed.
(Two torpedoes hit the stern of the Osaarian ship, and it scrapes the
side of the sphere as it tumbles.)
REED: Their engines are down.
ARCHER: Keep our weapons locked on them.
 [Brig]
 ARCHER:
Your codes worked. (to guard) Get him out of there.
ORGOTH: Now that I've served my purpose you're taking me back to the
airlock?
ARCHER: Escort him to the Launch bay. We're taking you back to the
sphere.
ORGOTH: So you have let your morality get in the way after all. Mercy
is not a quality that will serve you well in the Expanse, Captain.

 ARCHER:
Computer, load the Xindi database.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Extinction
Extinction
Original Airdate: 24 September, 2003
  (In a forest, a humanoid is
running for his life. He reaches a spacecraft, but three fully
space-suited people catch up with him, and turn their flame-throwers on
him.)
 [T'Pol's
quarters]
 T'POL:
(lighting a candle) Come in.
TUCKER: Thanks for seeing me so late. You sure I'm not bothering you?
T'POL: Not at all. (He hands over a lidded bowl.)
TUCKER: Georgia peaches. I picked up a crate
when we were back on Earth. Chef's been keeping then in stasis for me.
They're as fresh as the day they were picked.
T'POL: Thank you.
TUCKER: Aren't you going to try one?
T'POL: I don't usually eat this late.
TUCKER: Come on. One bite? (He takes the lid off.)
T'POL: (takes a bite) This doesn't make up for the two sessions you
cancelled.
TUCKER: Maybe you haven't noticed, but I've been a little busy lately.
It's not like I didn't want to come back. After our last session I
slept like a baby. First time in months. So, should I just
T'POL: Please. (He takes his shirt off and sits down.) T'POL: Your shoes as well.
TUCKER: Shoes?
T'POL: There are many neural nodes in the soles of the feet.
TUCKER: Hold on. You never said anything about feet.
T'POL: Is that a problem?
TUCKER: Well, for one thing, I haven't had a shower since this morning,
and I know how sensitive that Vulcan nose of your can be. And I'm a
little ticklish. Maybe more than a little.
T'POL: I'll stop at the first sign of discomfort. (Tucker lies down on his stomach.)
TUCKER: Oh! Your hands are ice cold. (She rubs them together to warm them before starting again.)
T'POL: Long
deep breaths.
TUCKER: You sure this is safe? I mean, has anyone ever tried it on a
human before?
T'POL: Not to my knowledge. The risk of paralysis is minimal. Breathe.
TUCKER: That's the spot. (comm. beeps)
T'POL: T'Pol.
ARCHER [OC]: It's the Captain. I'd like you to join me in the Command
centre right away.
 [Command
centre]
 ARCHER:
Sorry if I woke you.
T'POL: I wasn't asleep.
ARCHER: Look at this. (A picture of an Arboreal comes on the screen.)
T'POL: Another species of Xindi?
ARCHER: According to Phlox, they probably evolved from some form of
arboreal primate. I managed to piece together some of their starcharts.
It took me half the night to figure out how they map co-ordinates, but
I've been able to reconstruct the ship's course over the past few
months. This is the last planet they visited before they were attacked
by the marauders.
T'POL: Does it say what they were doing there?
ARCHER: No, but it's only a day away.
T'POL: We don't know if these Xindi were involved with the ones who
attacked Earth.
ARCHER: We don't know they weren't. Tell Travis to set a course.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
The ecosystem is prolific. There are several million chromophyllic
plant species alone.
ARCHER: What about Xindi?
T'POL: I'm not detecting any humanoid life, but it'll take several
hours to search all the land masses.
REED: Captain, I'm picking up a metallic signature at the northern end
of those equatorial islands. It looks like a landing craft.
ARCHER: Any bioscans?
T'POL: None within a thirty kilometre radius.
 [Shuttlepod]
 REED:
Now at thirteen kilometres.
T'POL: There's a break in the canopy. It should be wide enough.
ARCHER: (piloting) I see it.
 [Forest
- night]
 REED:
Sir. (He arrives at the alien craft. The hatch is open and it's empty.)
T'POL: Judging by the oxidation, this happened about two weeks ago.
HOSHI: Right about the time the Xindi were here.
ARCHER: It's definitely one of theirs. I recognise it from the
database. (to Reed) Search the area. See what else you can find. (to
T'Pol) Some of their databanks may still be intact.
HOSHI: Captain. A body. (A very burnt body.)
T'POL: It isn't Xindi. At least, not one of the three species we're
familiar with.
HOSHI: Maybe it was one of the other two.
REED: What about him?
T'POL: The readings are the same.
ARCHER: This whole area's been scorched.
HOSHI: Are you all right?
REED: (sweating) I never much care for the tropics.
ARCHER: Keep looking. (T'Pol finds mottling on her forearms and feels ridges developing
around her eyes.)
T'POL: Lieutenant?
(Reed now looks very alien, and sounds it too. At the craft, Archer is changing too, internally as well as
externally, and it hurts.)
T'POL: Captain! T'Pol to Enterprise.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS:
Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: Send a security team to the surface. We're being altered by
some kind of
ARCHER [OC]: (alien)
TRAVIS: Sub-commander?
 [Forest
- night]
 ARCHER:
(alien) (T'Pol draws her phase pistol.)
T'POL: Stay back.
(He comes towards her so she shoots him, but then she has to fight a
mutated Hoshi. When Reed turns up too, she runs away but trips up and
passes out. The changed crew carry her to a clearing where she wakes
again.)
T'POL: Captain, untie me. Let me go. (He does, over Hoshi's protests.)
T'POL: Thank you. (Archer sniffs around her neck and makes clicking sounds.) T'POL: We have
to get back to Enterprise. Enterprise?
ARCHER: (alien) (T'Pol reaches for the universal translator.)
T'POL: May I have that? The
device, may I have it?
REED: (alien)
ARCHER: (alien)
(Hoshi hands it over gingerly, as if she doesn't know what it is.)
T'POL: This may help us understand each other. You're going to have to
talk. Talk. You need to talk.
 [Situation
room]
 PHLOX:
That's a Vulcan biosign, I'm certain of it.
TUCKER: But these aren't human.
PHLOX: Definitely not.
TUCKER: Then where's the rest of our team? The only reason I don't have
a search party down there right now is because you needed more time to
analyse the data. Now unless you can give me a damn good reason to wait
around
PHLOX: When T'Pol called to the ship, she said something was happening
to them.
TRAVIS: She said they were being altered.
PHLOX: It's possible she was speaking literally. Something on the
planet may have transformed them, physiologically.
TUCKER: You're saying these alien biosigns could be our people.
PHLOX: From what we've seen of the Expanse, it's a possibility we have
to consider. The laws of biochemistry on this world may be just as
unpredictable as the laws of physics.
TRAVIS: Whoever they are, they're not staying put. They're heading due
east of the landing site.
TUCKER: Prep shuttlepod two.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
PHLOX: I'd like a little more time to study these readings.
TUCKER: We'll use EV suits and biohazard protocols. Have the Decon
chamber ready when we get back.
 [Forest]
 ARCHER:
Enterprise.
T'POL: Yes. It's your ship. You're the Captain.
REED: We don't have time for this. We have to find Urquat. It's all
that matters now.
T'POL: Urquat?
REED: We have to keep looking. It's somewhere close.
HOSHI: Why are you talking to her? She's trying to delay us. Our people
are there.
REED: They can help us, tell us what happened, why we can't remember.
T'POL: Captain, that device. I can use it to call Enterprise. You have
a doctor on board. He can prove to you what I'm saying is true.
HOSHI: Don't trust her. She's not one of us.
ARCHER: We don't know what she is.
T'POL: Urquat. You said we need to find Urquat. We should keep
searching. (Archer grabs T'Pols arm and pulls her along.)
ARCHER: It can't be far.
(Reed scents food, and leaps easily up a tree. He comes back with two
eggs to eat, Archer snatches one and Hoshi gets the other. She opens it
to reveal some larvae which she devours hungrily. Reed is annoyed and
he fights Archer, but he loses and crawls away. Archer breaks open the
other egg and offers some to T'Pol.)
T'POL: No, thank you. I'm not hungry. (Archer lets a contrite and
begging Reed have a share)
 [Shuttlepod]
 TUCKER:
They're about three kilometres east of us. We don't have too many
options for a landing site. Hope you boys are up for a little walk.
 [Forest
- night]
 T'POL:
It's a shuttlepod from Enterprise. They won't hurt you. Let me talk to
them.
(Tucker and two EV suited MACO's scan for their missing colleagues.)
TUCKER: Keep your weapons on stun. Circle around.
(Archer and Co. hide, then Reed jumps one of the MACOs. Hoshi gets
shot.) TUCKER: Chang!
(Tucker stuns Reed, but Archer attacks him with a club and cracks his
faceplate.)
T'POL: Captain! Wait! Don't you recognise him? (Archer runs off as the
other MACO arrives.) T'POL: Take Lieutenant Reed back to Sickbay.
TUCKER: What about you?
T'POL: I'm staying with them.
TUCKER: Sub-Commander!
 [Sickbay]
 (Phlox
is watching Reed rage in the Decon chamber, on a monitor.)
TUCKER: He didn't even recognise me.
PHLOX: Don't be offended. In his current condition, I doubt he'd
recognise any of us.
TUCKER: Any idea what caused this?
PHLOX: A mutagenic virus. His blood was swarming with them. It was
apparently designed to re-write the DNA of its host, to transform any
humanoid it infected into another species.
TUCKER: Why did it have so little effect on T'Pol?
PHLOX: Vulcan K-cells. They seem to neutralise the pathogen. I've been
synthesising an anti-virus using T'Pol's genetic profile, but I'm going
to need an active sample of her DNA to complete it. We need to get her
back to the ship as soon as possible.
TUCKER: I'm doing my best.
TRAVIS [OC]: Bridge to Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: Go ahead.
TRAVIS [OC]: Two ships just dropped out of warp, sir. They're on an
intercept course.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS:
They're hailing us.
TUCKER: Open a channel.
TRET [on viewscreen]: Your ship is in restricted space.
TUCKER: Sorry, it wasn't very well marked.
TRET [on viewscreen]: Our scans indicate that one of the people on your
ship has been infected with a dangerous virus.
TUCKER: We're aware of that. Is there anything you can tell us about
TRET [on viewscreen]: Your vessel's under quarantine. Prepare to be
boarded.
TUCKER: No one's coming aboard unless I say so.
TRET [on viewscreen]: The infected organism must be eradicated before
the virus can spread.
TUCKER: That infected organism is a member of my crew.
TRET [on viewscreen]: Does he still look like one of your crew? Does he
recognise you or even speak your language anymore? We've been studying
the mutagen for sixty years. The only course of action is to neutralise
the outbreak.
TUCKER: There isn't any outbreak. Lieutenant Reed is in medical
isolation.
TRET [on viewscreen]: We won't allow your vessel to leave orbit with
the contagion aboard.
TUCKER: Look, we've only been dealing with this virus for one day, so
forgive me if I don't take your word for it that the only option is to
neutralise our Tactical Officer. You want to come over to discuss the
situation, fine, but if you try to force your way onto this ship you're
going to have one hell of a fight on your hands.
 [Forest
- night]
(Archer wakes from a vivid dream of a big city.)  ARCHER:
How long was I asleep?
T'POL: Only for a few minutes.
ARCHER: I saw it. In my dream, I was there.
HOSHI: Urquat?
ARCHER: Our city.
T'POL: There are no cities on this planet.
ARCHER: You're wrong. It's below the surface.
HOSHI: Tell me. What was it like?
ARCHER: It was filled with thousands of Loque'eque, waiting for us.
T'POL: Your home is a planet called Earth. The people there are waiting
for you. You're on a mission to save them.
ARCHER: Urquat's my home. When we get there you'll understand. Wait and
see. We've rested long enough.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX:
The Decon chamber's sealed. I assure you there's no danger.
TRET: You wouldn't be so confident if you knew how easily this virus
can spread. It infected tens of millions of people on my world. They
all had to be destroyed.
TUCKER: Destroyed?
TRET: The virus would have transformed our entire population within
weeks.
TUCKER: Where did it come from?
TRET: It was engineered by the inhabitants of this planet, a race
called the Loque'eque. Something decimated their species centuries ago
and they lost the ability to reproduce, so they created this virus to
transform other species into their own. It was the only way to save
themselves from extinction.
PHLOX: Ingenious, but why didn't they programme the virus to stop
replicating once their population was replenished?
TRET: We've been trying to answer that question for a long time.
TUCKER: Why's he so eager to get back to a place called Urquat?
TRET: The mutagen encodes the victims with an overpowering instinct to
return to their home city, Urquat. That's why we can't allow even a
single infected organism to leave this planet. They can spread the
contagion to other systems and anyone who became infected would be
drawn back here. We can't risk another epidemic. (his communicator
sounds) Yes.
ALIEN [OC]: We've detected three more infected organisms on the
surface.
TRET: Prepare a containment team. More of your crewmen?
PHLOX: One of them has an immunity to the virus. If I could have access
to some of your research, perhaps we could work together.
TRET: We will find these people and examine them. If there's anything
to report, we'll let you know.
TUCKER: I'd prefer to have Doctor Phlox examine them.
TRET: What you prefer doesn't matter. I'm under orders to contain this
outbreak. If you attempt to interfere, I'm authorised to use any force
necessary. (to guard) Take me back to the airlock. (leaves)
PHLOX: If I don't complete the antivirus within the next two hours,
it'll be too late. There won't be enough of their original genome left
to resequence.
TUCKER: We can't launch a shuttlepod, they'd detect it. Do you think
T'Pol's contagious?
PHLOX: Most likely.
TUCKER: That rules out the transporter. She'd infect the entire crew.
PHLOX: Whatever you do, Commander, do it quickly. I need that DNA
sample.
TUCKER: Be right back. 
 [T'Pol's
quarters]
 (Tucker
does a quick search for the pot and finds the peach she sampled
earlier.)
TRAVIS [OC]: Bridge to Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: Go ahead.
TRAVIS [OC]: One of those ships just launched a shuttle, sir. It's
heading towards the surface.
TUCKER: Keep an eye on them.
 [Forest
- day]
 (At a
cliff face.)
ARCHER: It isn't far now. The passage was here, in my dream. Help me.
(They break through rubble into a tunnel, then look out over a vast
ruined city with a few corpses scattered around.)
 [Urquat]
 HOSHI:
You said they'd be waiting for us.
ARCHER: I saw it so clearly. There was a fountain there, and gardens up
there, floating. And there were people, thousands of people.
T'POL: Come back to Enterprise. We'll help you find out what happened
to your city.
ARCHER: No, no. We're not leaving. This is our home. Home, home.
T'POL: Look around. These ruins are ancient. No one has lived here for
a very long time.
ARCHER: What about this? (a corpse) This body isn't ancient. Someone
killed them. Why? Who would do this? Your people?
T'POL: No.
ARCHER: Then who?
T'POL: I don't know, but if we go to Enterprise we can try to find out.
ARCHER: I don't belong on Enterprise. I belong here.
HOSHI: Someone's coming.
ARCHER: More of your humans?
T'POL: I don't think so. We're not safe here. Come, we must go. Come,
we must go.
(They head down stairs towards the city. An alien in an EV suit sees them running.)
ALIEN: We've found them.
TRET [OC]: Take the Vulcan woman, then destroy the others.
ALIEN: Understood.
(The trio are heading through rough tunnels.)
ARCHER: Who are they?
T'POL: I don't know. (Archer jumps one, grabs his weapon and begins smashing at his helmet
with it.)
ARCHER: You destroyed my city, killed my people. (T'Pol is grabbed by
the other alien but she and Hoshi fight back, getting his weapon.
Archer raises a rock to kill the alien.)
T'POL: Captain! We have to get to the surface. (He puts the rock down
and they leave the alien to discover a tear in his spacesuit.)
ARCHER: This way. (Other aliens turn up and incinerate the one with the
hole in his suit - whose eyes have already turned bright blue.)
 [Forest
- day]
 (T'Pol,
Hoshi and Archer burst out into the open, and are surrounded by
space-suited aliens.)
ALIEN 2: Lower your weapon and move away. You won't be harmed. (He grabs
T'Pol.) ALIEN 2: I said, move away.
(Enterprise people beam down in EV suits and stun them just before they
can incinerate Archer and Hoshi.)
TUCKER: You all right?
T'POL: You said you'd never use the transporter again.
TUCKER: Believe me, I wish I'd had a choice. There are more of them in
orbit. We'd better get back to the shuttlepod before they realise
anything's wrong.
T'POL: Captain, you can't stay here. You'll be safe on Enterprise.
 [Bridge]
 (The
shuttlepod returns.)
COMM. OFFICER: It's Commander Tucker.
TRAVIS: Put him through. Go ahead, sir.
TUCKER [OC]: We're docking, Travis. Tell Phlox to stand by in Decon. Go
to warp four as soon as we're in.
TRAVIS: Understood. (He relieves his temporary helm officer. Enterprise jumps to warp, with the other two ships in hot pursuit.)
TUCKER: Report.
TRAVIS: They're in pursuit. Two thousand kilometres and closing.
TUCKER: Try to stay ahead of them. Stand by weapons.
COMM. OFFICER: They're hailing us.
TUCKER: Don't respond. Hold your course.
TRAVIS: Nine hundred kilometres.
COMM. OFFICER: They're charging weapons.
TRAVIS: Seven hundred.
(Enterprise is hit by weapons fire.)
TUCKER: Full power to aft hull plating.
(The aliens keep firing, but they don't often hit.)
TRAVIS: Hull plating's down to forty percent.
COMM. OFFICER: We're being hailed again.
TRET [on viewscreen]: Drop out of warp.
TUCKER: Look, we both want the same thing. A cure for this virus,
right? Our doctor thinks he's found one, but he needs a little more
time
TRET [on viewscreen]: I won't warn you again, Commander. We're going to
contain this outbreak whether you co-operate or not.
ARCHER: (not completely back to normal) Why are you firing at my ship?
TRET [on viewscreen]: There are three infected people on board. We
won't allow you to leave this system.
PHLOX: This is Captain Archer and Ensign Sato. They're the people you
nearly incinerated on that planet. As you can see, they're responding
quite well to the antivirus I synthesised.
TRET [on viewscreen]: That's not possible.
PHLOX: Run scans. See for yourself.
TUCKER: Like I said, he just needed a little more time. I'm sure we'd
be happy to share the antivirus with you, but that'll be impossible if
you destroy our ship.
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've given Phlox's serum to the
captain of the containment vessel. With any luck, he'll be able to use
it to prevent future outbreaks. As for Malcolm, Hoshi and me, it may be
a few days before we feel fully human again.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX:
This should help with the headaches.
REED: Have you got anything for my stomach? The Chef's food isn't
sitting too well.
PHLOX: Till your digestive tract is fully restored, you may want to
avoid the Mess hall.
REED: What do you suggest I eat?
PHLOX: You're welcome to some of the moth larvae I feed to my Pyrithian
bat.
ARCHER: How are you feeling, Lieutenant?
REED: Not bad, sir. How about yourself?
ARCHER: Getting there. Hoshi and T'Pol are going to take the day off.
You might want to do the same.
REED: Thank you, Captain. I could use a little rest. (Reed leaves.)
ARCHER: You wanted to see me?
PHLOX: This is the last of the mutagenic virus. I assume you want me to
destroy it.
ARCHER: No.
PHLOX: Captain, you experienced first-hand what this pathogen can do.
ARCHER: Those containment patrols aren't going to stop until they've
wiped out every trace of it. Now that they have your antivirus, they'll
most likely figure out a way to succeed.
PHLOX: Considering the alternatives, that would be best.
ARCHER: (takes the vial) This was created as a final effort to preserve
a civilisation, a people. That species we became, they cease to exist
the moment this virus is gone.
PHLOX: Captain.
ARCHER: We came out here to stop the Xindi destroying humanity. I'll be
damned if I'm going to have a hand in destroying another race in the
process. Put it on ice, Doc, in stasis, whatever. Understood?
(Phlox nods, and puts it into a tiny metal box.)

Original Airdate: 1 Oct, 2003
  [Xindi
Council Chamber]
 HUMANOID: How much of the lab was destroyed?
DEGRA: Nearly all of it. Three of my researchers were killed.
REPTILIAN: And what of your work, Degra?
DEGRA: I haven't been able to assess how much data was lost. This will
obviously delay us.
INSECTOID: How long?
DEGRA: Months perhaps. I'm not certain.
INSECTOID: The humans have been through our space!
REPTILIAN: They attacked a trellium mine. We cannot wait any longer.
DEGRA: Think what you're asking me to do. Build a weapon to destroy an
entire world. Do you understand how difficult, how dangerous this
project is?
REPTILIAN: Are you saying you're not up to the task?
AQUATIC: Dissension will solve nothing. We knew there could be
setbacks.
ARBOREAL: I agree. We are too far along to change our plan.
HUMANOID: Besides, we have no alternative.
REPTILIAN: You know that isn't true.
HUMANOID: That option has been discussed and rejected.
INSECTOID: Not by all of us.
REPTILIAN: Perhaps it is time to reconsider our colleagues' proposal.
HUMANOID: We do not have enough information about the humans!
REPTILIAN: That can be remedied.
AQUATIC: It's too dangerous.
ARBOREAL: I agree. Degra deserves more time.
AQUATIC: But if we do not see some progress soon, we'll have no choice
but to consider all our options.
 [T'Pol's quarters]
(T'Pol is massaging on Trip's temples.)  T'POL: Is that
sufficient pressure?
TUCKER: You could go a little harder. Mmm, perfect. Try that neck
thing. What'd you call it?
T'POL: The Khavorta posture?
TUCKER: Yeah, that one.
T'POL: Are you certain?
TUCKER: Don't worry, I've been practicing my breathing. (She presses underneath his ears.)
T'POL: You have been practicing.
TUCKER: T'Pol.
T'POL: Don't speak. Relax your jaw. Excellent. Now, the surah'than.
TUCKER: You know, I really need to talk to you about something.
T'POL: Is there a problem?
TUCKER: No. No, no, I mean, this feels great, and I really appreciate
you taking the time. It's just, I'm not sure we should be doing it
anymore.
T'POL: You said this was helping you sleep.
TUCKER: It has.
T'POL: Then why do you want to stop?
TUCKER: People are talking. About us. About me coming to your quarters
at night. They think there's more going on than neuro-pressure.
T'POL: And that disturbs you.
TUCKER: It shouldn't, I know, but Malcolm and I were purging a clogged
injector assembly only last week and he asked me why I didn't just
massage it with my magic fingers.
T'POL: I see no reason to be concerned with idle gossip.
TUCKER: It doesn't bother you?
T'POL: We're both senior officers. If we were pursuing a romantic
relationship it wouldn't be Lieutenant Reed's concern, would it?
TUCKER: I suppose not.
T'POL: Shall we continue?(In his bed, Archer is restless, and his squirming and twitching
wakes Porthos. Archer gets up and goes to the mirror. His remaining
Locque'que marks are itching,)
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: You've been scratching again.
ARCHER: The itching kept me up all night.
PHLOX: Have you been using the ointment I gave you?
ARCHER: I tried, but the smell is a little strong.
PHLOX: The more you scratch, the longer it will take to heal. I
understand you may have found a source of trellium-D?
ARCHER: A V'radian chemist we met at the deuterium station claims he
knows a way to synthesis it.
PHLOX: I hope he's correct. Crewman Cutler broke her arm when one of
those spatial anomalies went through the Exo-biology lab. The sooner
the ship is insulated against these phenomena the happier I will be.
ARCHER: We're working on it, Doctor.
PHLOX: Of course. (Phlox holds out a jar of ointment. Archer applies it
reluctantly.) PHLOX: Have you had any other symptoms?
ARCHER: Just dreams. I keep seeing myself back at that alien city.
PHLOX: You were transformed into a different species. Don't expect to
recover overnight.
 [Indoor Marketplace]
 (The planet they are orbiting is blue. Very blue -
it's all ocean. Archer, Reed and Tucker make their way through a busy
market.)
ARCHER: The chemist said his shop was on barge twelve.
TUCKER: Phlox would have a field day here.
ARCHER: I'm afraid we'll have to save the souvenir hunting for another
time. (An alien with very big pointed ears speaks to them.)
ALIEN: I don't recognise your species. You
must be newcomers. Welcome.
ARCHER: Thank you. We're looking for barge twelve, a chemist named
B'Rat Ud.
ALIEN: It would be a shame if I let you leave our world without
introducing you to the local wildlife.
ARCHER: That's not necessary.
ALIEN: Zentho marmots make wonderful pets, and the flesh is quite
succulent when prepared properly.
ARCHER: No, thank you. Can you direct us to the chemist?
ALIEN: Barge twelve is that way. Tier two.
 [Chemist's shop]
 B'RAT UD: (a fancy nose) I'm closed.
ARCHER: I have an appointment. We met at the deuterium station on
Norellus.
B'RAT UD: You'll have to come back later.
ARCHER: You said you could sell us the formula to synthesise
trellium-D. I hope you didn't bring us all this way for nothing.
B'RAT UD: Captain Archer? I remember now. How are you?
ARCHER: A little pressed for time.
B'RAT UD: Of course. Trellium-A is extremely common, easy to
synthesise, but trellium-D is rare, difficult to process.
TUCKER: And expensive?
B'RAT UD: I'm confident we can agree on a fair price. I was thinking
about you recently, Captain. You were very eager to learn about the
Xindi, as I recall. What is your interest in them?
ARCHER: We're on a diplomatic mission.
B'RAT UD: A diplomatic mission. Some Xindi arrived here last week. I
thought you might be interested.
REED: Where can we find them?
B'RAT UD: They had business with another merchant.
ARCHER: Who?
B'RAT UD: I'd be happy to direct you, for a small fee.
ARCHER: Commander Tucker has the list of supplies and equipment we'd be
willing to barter. As a gesture of good faith, why don't you tell me
where we can find this merchant, then you and Mister Tucker can work
out the details.
TUCKER: I'm confident we can agree on a fair price.
 [Slave market]
(The lady in charge speaks to the gazing audience while trailing her
whip.)  MISTRESS: Do you like what you see?
ZJOD: (pink eyes, grey skin and huge forehead) To answer your first
question, I regret I cannot offer free samples.
ARCHER: B'Rat Ud said you might be able to help us.
ZJOD: I always welcome referrals. What is your pleasure?
ARCHER: We were told you've recently done business with some Xindi.
ZJOD: Excellent customers. They purchased two U'tani serpent women. I'm
afraid I don't have any more, but perhaps I could interest you in a
Nuvian concubine? She's quite skilled.
ARCHER: We're not interested. I want to know where we can find these
Xindi.
ZJOD: I believe they left orbit two days ago.
ARCHER: Where were they heading?
ZJOD: I wouldn't stay in business very long if I revealed confidential
information about my clients, but I have females here from many worlds.
Who knows, perhaps one of them can tell you what you want to know about
the Xindi.
(Archer looks around, starts to move away, then stops and turns to look
at a blonde woman in white.)
ZJOD: You have an excellent eye, my friend. She can be very
accommodating.
ARCHER: (communicator chirps) Archer.
TUCKER [OC}: Captain, B'Rat and I have agreed on a price. I'll need to
go back to the ship for his payment.
ARCHER: Understood. We'll meet you back at the shuttlepod.(The pair
leave.)
ZJOD: How can you walk away from such beauty?
ARCHER: Thanks for your time.
REED: After an hour in this place, I can't wait to get back to Decon.
(They are nearly at the exit when there's a commotion.)
ZJOD [OC]: Stop her! (The woman in white puts her arms around Archer's neck.)
RAJIIN: Take me
with you, please.
ZJOD: She seems determined to be sold today. Let's go back to my shop
and arrange for payment.
ARCHER: I don't think so.
ZJOD: Then I'll take my merchandise.
ARCHER: Looks like she doesn't want to go with you.
ZJOD: If you're so concerned about what she wants, buy her. Otherwise,
stay out of this. (Zjod pulls a weapon and grabs for Rajiin, Reed pulls
his phaser, Zjod and Archer fight, knocking over barrels, until Archer
throws him through a window.)
ARCHER: Let's get out of here!
REED: Gladly.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: You have the most intriguing eyes. I've
never seen a retinal structure this complex.
ARCHER: How's our guest?
PHLOX: I'm not familiar with her species, but she appears to be in
perfect health.
ARCHER: I'm afraid I don't even know your name.
RAJIIN: I'm called Rajiin. I'm very grateful for what you've done,
Captain. I'll serve you well, I promise.
ARCHER: Let's get something straight. We don't believe one person can
own another person. You're free to go wherever you'd like. How far is
your home world?
RAJIIN: I don't know. I'm told it's called Oran'taku, but I don't
remember it.
ARCHER: Do you have any family?
RAJIIN: I've had many owners.
ARCHER: We have some data on this region of space. I'll see if I can
locate Oran'taku. If it's possible, we'll take you there. (to Phlox)
Set her up in quarters, get her whatever she needs.
PHLOX: Of course.
RAJIIN: Captain? Thank you.
 [Chemist's shop]
(Tucker opens a case containing ten glass vials.)
 TUCKER: On our planet, wars were fought over these. Careful.
(B'rat opens a vial and sprinkles some powder on his upper nasal
openings, then sneezes happily.)
B'RAT UD: What's this one called?
TUCKER: Black pepper. There's paprika, mustard seed. I'm partial to the
cayenne myself. I'm sure you'll find these all very exotic.
REED: I believe you have something for us?
B'RAT UD: Of course. I've reviewed your engineering specifications. You
appear to have the necessary equipment to produce liquid trellium-D.
REED: Liquid?
B'RAT UD: Trellium can only be synthesised in a liquid state. It's just
as effective as the natural ore.
TUCKER: Then all we need is the recipe.
B'RAT UD: There is one thing. Be sure to follow the protocols
precisely.
TUCKER: Or?
B'RAT UD: Let's just say that in it's liquid form, trellium-D is
extremely unstable. (B'rat hands over the PADD and carries on sampling the
peppers.)
 [Captain's mess]
 ARCHER: How are your accommodations?
RAJIIN: Much better than I'm used to. The last ship I was on, I never
left the cargo hold. Except for a few visits to the Captain's quarters.
ARCHER: There are some restricted areas on Enterprise, otherwise feel
free to look around.
RAJIIN: Your crew won't mind?
ARCHER: I seriously doubt it.
RAJIIN: Are they all from Earth?
ARCHER: Nearly all. You've met Doctor Phlox, he's from Denobula. My
first officer's a Vulcan.
RAJIIN: Doctor Phlox mentioned you were on an important mission.
ARCHER: We're trying to make contact with a species called Xindi. I
don't suppose you know anything about them?
RAJIIN: Very little. The two I saw looked reptilian, and they weren't
very pleasant. At the time, I was just relieved they weren't interested
in me. Why are you looking for them?
ARCHER: We're hoping to resolve a disagreement.
TUCKER [OC]: Tucker to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Archer.
TUCKER [OC]: We're in business, sir.
ARCHER: I'll be right there. Excuse me.
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER: How unstable?
TUCKER: Enough to do some serious damage if we screw this up.
ARCHER: And we're supposed to insulate the entire ship with it?
TUCKER: It's only volatile in it's liquid form. Once we apply it to the
inner hull and it sets, it's completely safe. The tricky part's cooking
it up in the first place.
T'POL: It'll require extremely precise calculations but I believe
Mister Tucker and I can synthesise the compound safely.
ARCHER: Get started.
T'POL: I recommend we set up a lab on E deck, within the emergency
bulkheads, as a precaution.
 [Archer's quarters]
(Archer is stripped down to vest and shorts.)  ARCHER: Come
in. (No one enters so he gets up and opens the door. It is Rajiin in a grey trouser suit.)
RAJIIN: Good evening, Captain.
ARCHER: Is everything all right?
RAJIIN: I'm sorry to disturb you. I hoped you might have time to talk.
ARCHER: Er, I'm not quite, er. Please. I meant to speak with you
earlier. We have some good news. T'Pol was able to locate your home
planet in a database we acquired. It's only two days away. You don't
seem very pleased.
RAJIIN: I was taken away when I was very young. I don't remember much
about it, and I doubt anyone there would remember me.
ARCHER: You never know. You seem very memorable to me.
RAJIIN: I'm very grateful for what you've done, Captain. I want to
repay you for your kindness. (She moves very close.)
ARCHER: That isn't necessary.
RAJIIN: I know.
ARCHER: Rajiin, you
RAJIIN: There's a reason I was taken from my home. I have certain
gifts. Would you like me to show you?
ARCHER: That really isn't something that I (She kisses him.)
RAJIIN: It's all right. (She runs her hands over his head and torso.
There's a strange glow and we can see his muscle and bone structure.
Suddenly, they're standing far apart.) RAJIIN: Captain, is something wrong?
ARCHER: No.
RAJIIN: (goes to leave) Well, I just wanted to say thank you again.
ARCHER: We'll be leaving orbit soon.
RAJIIN: Good night.
ARCHER: Good night.
 [Trellium lab]
 TUCKER: What's the molecular pressure?
T'POL: Up to eleven hundred units.
TUCKER: Boy, this stuff is tricky. Decrease the theta bombardment by
six, no, seven percent.
T'POL: The pressure's still rising. Fourteen hundred units. Fourteen
thirty.
TUCKER: Damn it. Kill the theta radiation altogether.
T'POL: No effect. We should seal off this section and leave.
TUCKER: A sustained burst of delta radiation might do the trick.
T'POL: It might not. We should evacuate.
TUCKER: I'm going to ramp the delta at eighty percent.
T'POL: It's not working.
TUCKER: You're welcome to leave.
T'POL: The pressure is up to two thousand units. Commander!
(They leave and the container goes big bang, wrecking the table.)
T'POL: (in doorway) Some of our calculations may have been slightly
off.
TUCKER: We're back to square one.
T'POL: We've been working for six hours. I suggest we take a break.
TUCKER: I can't argue with that.
T'POL: Come to my quarters in half an hour. We'll resume your
neuro-pressure regimen.
TUCKER: I'll be fine.
T'POL: I prefer you are rested before we make another attempt.
 [Transporter alcove]
 HOSHI: Can I help you?
RAJIIN: The Captain said it was all right if I left my quarters. I'm
Rajiin.
HOSHI: I know. News travels fast on a starship. I'm Ensign Hoshi Sato.
RAJIIN: (holding Hoshi's hand) It's a pleasure to meet you. I was
looking for the mess hall.
HOSHI: I just happen to be going that way.
(They start walking.)
RAJIIN: What's your job here?
HOSHI: I'm the ship's Communications Officer.
RAJIIN: I see.
HOSHI: I'd love to hear your language.
 [Turbolift]
 RAJIIN: Actually, I speak quite a few.
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 (T'Pol is kneeling down, lighting a candle.)
RAJIIN: You must be T'Pol. I didn't mean to startle you. My name's
Rajiin.
T'POL: I know who you are. What are you doing here?
RAJIIN: Your door was unlocked.
T'POL: That's not likely.
RAJIIN: I was hoping we'd have a chance to talk.
T'POL: Perhaps you are unfamiliar with our protocols, but it is
unacceptable for you to be in my quarters uninvited. (Rajiin kneels down and leans in close.)
RAJIIN: I didn't think you'd mind.
T'POL: I'm afraid (Rajiin strokes T'Pol's ears.)
RAJIIN: You're Vulcan, on a ship filled with
humans. Why?
T'POL: Vulcans and humans are allies. Now please leave. What are you
doing?
RAJIIN: Don't resist.
T'POL: I need you to leave.
RAJIIN: You have a disciplined mind. You're in such control of your
emotions. Try to let go. Better. (Rajiin runs her hands over T'Pol's torso and
once again we see muscle and bones.)
T'POL: Stop.
RAJIIN: Let go. (The door bell chimes. It's Tucker, and eventually T'Pol
is able to break away so Rajiin attacks her.)
T'POL: No!
 [Corridor outside T'Pol's quarters]
 TUCKER: Tucker to the Bridge.
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Go ahead.
TUCKER: Could you tell me where T'Pol is?
CREWWOMAN [OC]: She's in her quarters, sir. (Tucker overrides the door
lock.)
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 (T'Pol is lying on the floor. As he checks on her,
Rajiin breaks a jar over his head and runs off.)
TUCKER: Tucker to Security.
 [Corridor]
 RAJIIN: (into communicator) I need assistance.
REPTILIAN [OC]: Were you successful?
RAJIIN: I have what you want. I can use their transporter device but
you'll need to be within ten thousand kilometres.
REPTILIAN [OC]: Signal us when you're ready. (Rajiin is confronted by an armed security man.)
RAJIIN: Is there something wrong?
GUARD: The Captain would like to see you. (Rajiin touches the guard's hand.)
RAJIIN: There's no need to bother the Captain. (She gets
in close and personal.)
GUARD: I have my orders.
RAJIIN: So do I. (She mesmerises him and gets his weapon, using it to fire
at Reed. She goes through Engineering, shooting crewmen, falling gently
to land on her back and get up again straight away.)
 [Transporter alcove]
 RAJIIN: Are you in range? Respond.
ARCHER: (with phase pistol) Leaving so soon? (Two more security arrive,)
ARCHER: We jammed your signal. Your friends can't hear you. Who are they? Take
her to the Brig.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: You should let me run a neural scan.
TUCKER: I'll be fine. What happened to her?
PHLOX: I can't even begin to speculate. She's suffered disruptions
throughout her neocortex. If she were human, or Denobulan for that
matter, she'd probably be dead. But Vulcan neurophysiology is a great
deal more resilient than ours.
ARCHER: I want to talk to her.
PHLOX: I have to finish treating her injuries first.
ARCHER: How long?
PHLOX: A few hours.
(T'Pol slides into the Imaging Chamber.)
ARCHER: Have Phlox take a look at your head.
 [Brig]
(Archer holds up Rajiin's communicator.)  ARCHER: Who were you
trying to contact?
RAJIIN: I'm sorry.
ARCHER: I asked you a question.
RAJIIN: I can't answer it.
ARCHER: What did you do to T'Pol?
RAJIIN: She shouldn't have resisted.
ARCHER: (enters cell) Who are you?
RAJIIN: I told you. My name is Rajiin.
ARCHER: That's right. Kidnapped when you were a child, sold into a life
of slavery, and it was just a coincidence that you happened to escape
when I was at that market. The chemist knew I was looking for
information about the Xindi. Is that why you showed up so conveniently?
RAJIIN: The only thing I can tell you is that you're in danger.
ARCHER: Care to be a little more specific?
RAJIIN: If I say anything else, they'll kill me.
ARCHER: Who, the Xindi? How do you know I won't do the same?
RAJIIN: It's true that I deceived you, but that didn't make your
decision to help me any less admirable. I don't want to see you harmed,
Captain. The best thing for you to do is let me go.
ARCHER: Tell me who you contacted. Who!
REED [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
REED [OC]: Two vessels are approaching from aft. Sir,
 [Bridge]
 REED: The biosigns match the genetic profile of
the Xindi pilot who attacked Earth.
 [Brig]
 ARCHER: Hull plating to full power, stand by
weapons. The Reptilian species. They're the ones who sent you.
RAJIIN: I had no choice.
 [Bridge]
 (The two ships are firing at the nacelles.)
TRAVIS: We're dropping out of warp.
 [Brig]
 ARCHER: I assume they're here for you.
RAJIIN: They won't harm anyone if you let me go.
ARCHER: Forgive me if I don't take your word on that, but they murdered
seven million people on my planet!
REED [OC]: Bridge to the Captain.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
REED [OC]: The smaller ship is approaching the starboard docking port.
ARCHER: Seal that airlock and post security teams. I'm on my way.
(He closes the Brig door.) ARCHER: What was your mission?
RAJIIN: They wanted information.
ARCHER: About what?
RAJIIN: About you. They're building a weapon.
ARCHER: We know that.
RAJIIN: This is different. A bio-weapon.
ARCHER: Go on.
RAJIIN: They need data about your species before they can begin.
ARCHER: Where are they building the weapon?
RAJIIN: I don't know.
ARCHER: When will it be ready?
RAJIIN: I don't know. They didn't tell me anything else.
ARCHER: (to guard) Get a security detail down here. No one's taking her
anywhere.
 [Airlock]
 (The airlock disappears in an explosion, and there's a
fire-fight between reptilian Xindi and MACOs.)
MACO: Fall back!
(One gets shot.)
 [Corridor]
 (Archer joins Reed.)
REED: Three boarding parties, at least five men each.
ARCHER: They're heading for the Brig. Try to cut them off. (to a MACO)
You're with me.
(Reed's group meet an insectoid, who shoots Austin and leaves a
grenade. The Reptilians make it to the Brig. Phase pistols have no effect on
them. They fire a green globule onto a bulkhead which then fires lots
of little things at the security guards, taking them out, then they free
Rajiin. Archer and his MACO are in their way and get jumped. He sees
her leaving before his attacker is taken out.)
ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge.
TRAVIS [OC]: Go ahead.
ARCHER: Don't let those ships get away. Lay in a pursuit course.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Aye sir.
(The two ships vanish, as if they were going into a sphere cloaking
field.)
 [Corridor]
 MACO: He's dead, sir. (Referring to the reptilian.)
TRAVIS [OC]: Captain
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Those ships just entered some kind of
vortex. They're gone.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: This gland released a fatal dose of
neuro-toxin into his bloodstream.
TUCKER: What kind of species is born with a suicide gland?
PHLOX: Not this one. He was surgically enhanced, if you can call it an
enhancement.
ARCHER: I want a complete autopsy, Doctor, and have Malcolm take this
weapon apart. I want to find out it's range, power output and how we
can defend against it.
TUCKER: Aye sir. (He leaves with the rifle.)
ARCHER: Are you okay?
T'POL: Yes.
ARCHER: Good, because I want an analysis of the scans we took of those
Xindi ships, and find out what you can about that vortex they went
through. I don't want them dropping in unannounced again. Dismissed.
 [Xindi Council Chamber]
 ARBOREAL: You put all of our work at risk.
HUMANOID: And exposed us to the humans. Allowed one of your soldiers to
be captured.
REPTILIAN: He wasn't taken alive.
DEGRA: You agreed to give me more time. You don't have enough data to
construct the bio-weapon.
REPTILIAN: Don't we? Bring her! (Rajiin is brought in.) REPTILIAN: Show them. Show
them!
(Rajiin goes to the table and leans on it. A projection of a human, with
various organs, appears.) REPTILIAN: We couldn't pursue the bio-weapon
because we didn't have enough information about the humans. Now we do.
AQUATIC: We must proceed on both fronts.
HUMANOID: Do you expect us to reward you for this act of
insubordination? This has left us more vulnerable that we were before.
RAJIIN: There's more to these humans than you can learn from a set of
biometric scans.
REPTILIAN: That's enough! Take her.

  [Sickbay]
(Archer
wheels T'Pol in on a trolley.)
ARCHER: She's coming to!
T'POL: Let me go. Let me go! (She tries to strangle Archer.)
ARCHER: Stop.
T'POL: I'll kill you.
ARCHER: We're not going to hurt you.
T'POL: You liar! No! Get away from me. (T'Pol screams as she's strapped down.)
PHLOX: The damage is more severe than I expected.
ARCHER: Can you reverse it?
PHLOX: I'm not certain. T'Pol (tries to dodge the hypospray.)
T'POL: What's he doing?
ARCHER: It's all right. He's trying to help you.
T'POL: He's trying to kill me! You killed the others. Murderers! Get
away! (She screams until Archer holds her head and she is finally sedated,
then she is rolled into the Imaging Chamber.)
 One
Day Earlier
 [Command
Centre]
 TUCKER:
I talked with Chef at dinner. He's a little worried about the crew.
People are skipping meals. He figures they're either too busy or the
stress of this mission is starting to get to them.
ARCHER: I haven't had much of an appetite myself.
TUCKER: Movie night's been on hold since we entered the Expanse. Maybe
we should start it up again?
ARCHER: There'll be plenty of time for movies after we've dealt with
the Xindi.
TUCKER: No one hates the Xindi more than I do, Captain, but I'm telling
you this crew needs a little R and R. Unless you want Phlox to start
medicating people, we gotta, we've gotta find a way to boost morale.
ARCHER: What did you have in mind?
TUCKER: I was thinking about a comedy. One of the classic Hope and
Crosby pictures.
ARCHER: Good choice.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: We've been reviewing some of these Xindi star charts. Trip
thought they might be able to help us figure out if there are any more
spatial anomalies in the region.
T'POL: I would have helped you do that.
ARCHER: It's late. I didn't want to get you out of bed. Besides, our
resident insomniac was looking for something to do.
TUCKER: You have plans Tuesday night?
T'POL: Not at the moment.
TUCKER: Mess hall, nineteen hundred hours.
T'POL: Movie night?
TUCKER: Back by popular demand.
HOSHI: [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI:
I'm picking up an automated distress call, sir. It's Vulcan.
 [Command
Centre]
 ARCHER:
Have you tried hailing them?
HOSHI [OC]: Several times.
ARCHER: I'm on my way.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Where are they?
HOSHI: Three point two light years, bearing oh one six mark twelve.
T'POL: I recognise the transponder frequency. It's the Seleya. They
entered the Expanse nine months ago.
ARCHER: Keep hailing them. Set a course.
(They reach a place of erratic, colliding asteroids.)
T'POL: The asteroids are moving in a chaotic fashion. Their paths are
unpredictable. It may be the result of some spatial anomalies.
ARCHER: Where's the Vulcan ship?
T'POL: Approximately two thousand kilometres dead ahead.
TUCKER: I can guess why they were interested in this field. The
asteroids are loaded with trellium ore.
ARCHER: It looks a little too crowded in there for Enterprise. Wake up
Mister Reed. Tell him to meet us in the Launch bay.
HOSHI: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: (to Tucker) Try to get your hands on some of that ore. T'Pol.
 [Shuttlepod]
 T'POL:
Starboard bow, three hundred forty metres. (Archer is doing some very nifty avoiding  manoeuvres.)
ARCHER: I see
it. (Two asteroids collide.)
REED: No damage, though we may need a fresh coat of paint.
ARCHER: How much farther?
T'POL: Twelve hundred kilometres. I could take the helm if you'd like.
ARCHER: Maybe on the way back. So what else do you know about the
Seleya?
T'POL: A great deal. I served on it for over a year. It was my last
assignment before joining the consulate on Earth. I was the deputy
science officer under Captain Voris.
ARCHER: Any idea what they were doing in the Expanse?
T'POL: They were attempting to chart the thermobaric perimeter. After
several days they reported that they'd become caught in some kind of
subspace eddy and were being pulled into the Expanse. It was their
final transmission. The Vankaara was sent to find them. You already
know what happened to that crew.
ARCHER: Let's hope the Seleya fared a little better.
T'POL: Directly ahead, two hundred metres.
ARCHER: Hang on. (A very near miss.)
 [Transporter alcove]
 (A rock
is beamed aboard, and Tucker scans it.)
TUCKER: Good isotope density. We should get at least half a kilo out of
this one. (He hauls the rock off the pad.) TUCKER: Let's try for something bigger
this time. How about this one. (He points to a display.)
TRAVIS: I've got a lock. (Travis starts the beam-in sequence, and the floor
ripples.)
TUCKER: Travis?
TRAVIS: There's an overload in the resequencer.
TUCKER: Shut it down.
TRAVIS: I can't. (Circuits blow, the rock vanishes, the floor ripples,
then the rock reappears as pieces embedded in the walls.)
TUCKER: This thing's useless. The coils are fused.
TRAVIS: What if I could put a shuttlepod down on one of the big ones.
TUCKER: They're pretty unpredictable. You sure you could land safely?
TRAVIS: I can try.
TUCKER: This'll be a new one for the maintenance crew.
 [Shuttlepod]
(Reed scans the Seleya.)  REED:
Main power's offline. Their hull's taken quite a
beating.
HAWKINS: Life support?
REED: Minimal. Decks twelve and thirteen have decompressed.
T'POL: I'm reading multiple biosigns.
ARCHER: This is Captain Archer of the starship Enterprise. Please
respond. Seleya, come in.
T'POL: The starboard docking port is still intact.
 [Seleya]
 (They
climb into a wreck - spluttering electrics and debris scattered around.)
REED: Captain. They were lining this bulkhead with trellium. They
didn't get very far.
T'POL: I'm reading biosigns on this deck. I can't isolate them.
ARCHER: (to Reed) Take starboard.
(Reed and Hawkins head off together.)
REED: Vulcan blood.
(Archer and T'Pol force their way into another compartment. They hear a
regular clanging.)
T'POL: One biosign.
(They open another bulkhead, and get attacked by Vulcan with iron bar.
Archer is cut, T'Pol   tries to
takes their assailant down with a phaser but has little effect. Archer
finally gets him.)
ARCHER: You all right? T'Pol?
T'POL: I'm fine. (She scans the Vulcan.) T'POL: His synaptic pathways have been
severely damaged.
ARCHER: Let's get him in the pod.
T'POL: Captain! (Two more Vulcans approach.)
ARCHER: Keep back! (He phasers them.) ARCHER: Archer to Reed.
REED [OC]: Go ahead sir.
ARCHER: Have you come across anyone?
(Elsewhere.)
REED: Not yet.
ARCHER [OC]: Watch yourself. Something's happened to them. They've
become violent.
REED: Aye, sir. (They're promptly attacked by a whole group of Vulcans.
It takes several rifle shots to fell each one. Archer and T'Pol arrive
to help.)
ARCHER: Lieutenant, you okay?
REED: What happened to them?
T'POL: Seven more, that direction, thirty metres.
REED: Captain.
ARCHER: Let's get out of here.
(They head back to the pod, and Hawkins adjusts the setting on his
rifle.)
T'POL: What are you doing?
HAWKINS: Stun isn't working. We should set our weapons to kill.
T'POL: These are Vulcan officers and we're on a rescue mission.
HAWKINS: With respect ma'am, they don't seem to want our help.
T'POL: You heard me!
ARCHER: Keep your weapons on stun.
HAWKINS: Yes, sir.
(Back at the docking hatch, two Vulcans are standing guard.)
HAWKINS: Captain, over here.
REED: What are they doing?
ARCHER: We're from the Starfleet ship Enterprise. Do you understand me?
(A bulkhead is dropped just in front of the group.) ARCHER: Is there another way
to the airlock?
T'POL: No. (They're attacked from behind.) T'POL: That way.
ARCHER: Go. Go on. (They go up a ladder. Archer's foot is grabbed but
they fight them off and shut the hatch.) ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise.
Enterprise respond.
T'POL: If their comm. system's intact we may be able to contact
Enterprise from the Bridge.
ARCHER: Where is it?
T'POL: Seven decks above us.
REED: Seven. How many Vulcans are on board?
T'POL: Assuming the entire crew is still alive, one hundred and forty
seven.
REED: If I'm not mistaken, the launch bay's on this level. Maybe we can
use one of their shuttles.
T'POL: The bay's depressurised, probably from an asteroid impact.
ARCHER: We have to get back to our pod.
T'POL: That'll be difficult. All four bulkheads leading to the airlock
have been sealed.
ARCHER: We should keep moving. How's your arm?
HAWKINS: It's fine, sir.
REED: He's losing a lot of blood, Captain. We've got to treat this
wound.
ARCHER: How far to their Sickbay?
T'POL: It's two decks up.
ARCHER: Let's go. (to T'Pol) Are you all right?
T'POL: Since we've come aboard, I've been experiencing anxiety.
Whatever's happened to this crew may be starting to affect me.
ARCHER: We'll get you out of here as soon as we can.
 [Shuttlepod
two]
 (Our
two trellium miners are in EV suits minus helmets at the moment.)
TUCKER: This one's more isolated, and I'm reading large deposits near
the surface. Can you set us down?
TRAVIS: There isn't a flat spot much bigger than my quarters.
TUCKER: You're the pilot, it's your call.
TRAVIS: Let's go. I'm matching the rotational velocity.
TUCKER: Looking good. Two hundred metres. You're drifting to the left.
TRAVIS: Got it. (A bouncy landing.) TRAVIS: I hope you won't write that landing
up in your log.
TUCKER: Are you kidding? I'm going to recommend they give you a medal.
 [Asteroid]
 TUCKER:
Let's try to make this quick.
 [Seleya
Sickbay]
 (They
shoot one Vulcan who tries to pounce.)
ARCHER: Any idea what's causing this? (T'Pol scans the Vulcan who is restrained inside an isolation pod.)
T'POL: I'm not a doctor.
ARCHER: But you are my Science Officer. I need to know I can depend on
you.
T'POL: I'll do my best. His name is Solin. When I served here he was
the Chief Engineer. I knew him. (The Vulcan wakes.) T'POL: Can you understand me?
Sub-Commander T'Pol. We served together. Don't you recognise me? We're
here to help you but we need to know what happened to your crew. Solin,
look at me. Something has made you very ill. You've lost control. Tell
me what happened. Tell me! (Solin becomes violent.) T'POL: This is going to
happen to me.
ARCHER: You don't know that.
T'POL: It's already started. I can feel my control slipping away.
ARCHER: We're getting you off this ship.
T'POL: It's too late.
ARCHER: We're going to take the scans you made back to Phlox and figure
out what's going on here, but first we have to get to the shuttle. How
do you open those bulkheads? The bulkheads.
T'POL: There's an auxiliary control room on the Engineering deck.
ARCHER: Okay.
 [Seleya
crawlway]
 (T'Pol
stops for a rest.)
HAWKINS: Are you okay?
ARCHER: T'Pol, we have to keep moving. (She shrugs off Hawkin's helping hand.)
T'POL: I don't need your help.
 [Seleya
compartment]
 (They
come out into an area with fallen girders and spluttering cables.)
REED: Two more biosigns fifty metres beyond that hatch. It's the only
way to the Engineering deck.
ARCHER: We'll go deal with them. Stay with her, Hawkins.
HAWKINS: Aye sir. (T'Pol   slides gently down the wall to rest.)
HAWKINS: Water? No offense, but you look like you could use some.
T'POL: Thank you.
HAWKINS: I apologise for the way I reacted before. You were right, this
is a rescue mission. May I ask you a question? How is it possible that
this crew could turn so violent, when Vulcans aren't supposed to have
emotions.
T'POL: A common misconception. We have emotions. We simply keep them
suppressed, under control. Something has obviously caused them to lose
that control.
HAWKINS: Why would they want to kill us?
T'POL: There was a time in the past when we were an extremely violent
race. We nearly destroyed ourselves. Paranoia and homicidal rage were
common.
 [Seleya
crawlway]
REED: Five metres. (They come into another compartment and are attacked
by three Vulcans, who they quickly dispose of.)
ARCHER: Any more where they came from?
REED: Not at the moment.
ARCHER: Archer to Hawkins.
 [Seleya compartment] 

HAWKINS: Go ahead, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: We're all clear.
HAWKINS: Understood. We're on our way.
 [Asteroid]
 (The
pair are putting small rocks into a case.)
TRAVIS: I heard about the accident you and T'Pol had in the lab.
TUCKER: It was minor. Nothing to write home about.
TRAVIS: But you're sure this stuff is safe to bring on board?
TUCKER: Don't worry. It only tends to blow up in its liquid state.
(There's a small tremor.)
HOSHI [OC]: Enterprise to Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: Go ahead.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI:
Sir, we've just picked up a spatial anomaly at your coordinates.
TUCKER [OC]: We saw it.
HOSHI: It's altered the course of
 [Asteroid]
 HOSHI
[OC]: The asteroid. You're heading into a denser part of the field.
(They look up to see a very big asteroid heading straight for them.)
 [Shuttlepod
two]
 TRAVIS:
Grab a seat, Commander.
TUCKER: Don't worry about me. Just get us the hell out of here.
(they take off in a hail of small rocks, and just miss the big one)
TRAVIS: The starboard thruster's failing.
TUCKER: There's debris in the intake manifold. Can you purge it? (Mini-worlds collide behind them.)
TRAVIS: We're clear. We've only
got one thruster left.
TUCKER: Can you get us home?
TRAVIS: I think so.
TUCKER: Shuttlepod two to Enterprise.
HOSHI [OC]: Go ahead, Commander.
TUCKER: We're on our way back, but we've taken damage.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER
[OC]: Alert the launch bay crew to get ready for a rough docking.
HOSHI: Understood.
 [Seleya
Engineering]
 (They
enter through a ceiling hatch.)
ARCHER: Secure the door.
T'POL: The transceiver's been damaged.
ARCHER: Any chance of repairing it? T'Pol.
T'POL: What!
ARCHER: Any chance of repairing it.
T'POL: There's an auxiliary transmitter. If I can get access to it we
may be able to contact Enterprise.
REED: Sir, I've encrypted the locking codes, but if they're determined
to get in.
 [Launch
bay]
 (Pod Two is a battered mess.)
TUCKER: Looks like the impulse assembly took a beating. Open up the
engine housings and run a diagnostic.
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: Tucker here.
HOSHI [OC]: We're receiving a transmission from the Captain. It sounds
urgent.
TUCKER: Route it down here.
HOSHI [OC]: Go ahead, Captain.
ARCHER [OC]: Trip,
 [Seleya
Engineering]
 ARCHER:
We're going to need some help getting off this ship. How fast can you
be here?
 [Launch
bay]
 TUCKER:
Pod two took some damage in the asteroid field, sir. We're looking at a
couple of hours before we can launch again.
 [Seleya
Engineering]
 TUCKER
[OC]: What's the problem?
ARCHER: It's the Vulcan crew. Something's wrong with them.
 [Launch
bay]
 ARCHER
[OC]: We're going to transmit some biodata.
 [Seleya
Engineering]
 ARCHER:
Tell Phlox to start analysing it. See if there's anything we can do to
help these people.
TUCKER [OC]: Acknowledged. Anything else?
ARCHER: Just get that shuttle flying.
 [Launch
bay]
 TUCKER:
Aye sir.
ARCHER [OC]: Archer out.
TUCKER: You heard the Captain. Get a repair team down here.
 [Seleya
Engineering]
 T'POL:
The bulkhead controls were severed on deck nine. I've rerouted them
through the auxiliary grid. Mister Reed, are you finished with those
actuator circuits?
REED: They've all been realigned.
(T'Pol puts her hand in and gets an electric shock)
ARCHER: You okay?
T'POL: What did you do?
REED: I realigned the circuits, just like you asked me. (T'Pol pushes him away roughly.)
T'POL: These aren't sequenced correctly. You
overloaded the locking mechanism!
ARCHER: Then we'll have to try something else.
T'POL: It's pointless. The circuits are damaged! I should have been
watching him. You didn't want me to see. Now I know what you were doing
in the Command Centre.
ARCHER: What are you talking about?
T'POL: The Xindi starcharts. You were analysing them behind my back,
undermining my work.
ARCHER: No one's trying to sabotage your work. We should all just focus
on getting off this ship safely.
REED: There might be another way, sir. If we overload the power grid,
it would disrupt the systems all over the ship including the bulkhead
mechanisms.
T'POL: The warp reactor is unstable as it is. Disrupting main power
could shut down the anti-matter containment. You'd cause a reactor
breach.
ARCHER: I don't think we have much of a choice.
T'POL: You want to kill all of us. (pulls out her phase pistol) You
don't trust Vulcans. You never have.
REED: Sir, that pistol's set to kill.
ARCHER: Give me the weapon.
T'POL: Don't think I've forgotten. You blamed us for holding you back,
for undermining your father's work. Now you've decided to take revenge.
(Archer and Reed step forward) I'll fire!
ARCHER: Listen to me. This is a rescue mission. We're here to save
these people.
T'POL: You're lying. You want to kill them.
ARCHER: If that's true, then why would I keep our weapons on stun? It's
not logical. (She's distracted by a thumping at the door, and he
disarms her.)
 [Sickbay]
 TUCKER:
It doesn't make sense. T'Pol and I have been working with trellium for
weeks. She hasn't shown any symptoms.
PHLOX: I don't imagine she would have. Despite your best efforts, you
weren't able to synthesis it in any significant quantities. The crew of
the Seleya, however, had the misfortune of wandering into an asteroid
field filled with the compound. Trellium-D is a potent neurotoxin to
the Vulcan nervous system. It disrupts the synaptic pathways that allow
them to control emotions. Unfortunately the rate of decay is
accelerating.
 [Seleya Engineering] 

 ARCHER:
Is it too late?
PHLOX [OC]: I can treat her, but I nee to begin synaptic regeneration
as soon as possible.
ARCHER: What about the Vulcan crew? (Vulcan's start ripping out
circuits elsewhere.) ARCHER: Phlox, do you read me?
PHLOX [OC]: I'm afraid there's nothing we can do for the others.
They've been exposed for too long. The neurological damage is
irreversible. They're dying, Captain.
T'POL: He's lying. He wants them all to die.
ARCHER: Doctor, there are over a hundred and forty people on this ship.
PHLOX [OC]: I'm sorry, but they've been exp
ARCHER: Enterprise. Phlox, do you hear me? Respond.
REED: They've shut the comm. system down.
HAWKINS: Captain, they're flooding the compartment with hexafluorine.
(Outside, Vulcans batter at the door with iron bars.)
ARCHER: Shut it off.
REED: I can't. They've bypassed the environmental controls.
T'POL: They won't let you destroy this ship.
ARCHER: After you initiate the overload, how long do we have?
REED: About fifteen minutes, maybe less.
(Archer nods.)
T'POL: No!
ARCHER: You heard what the Doctor said. They can't be saved, but you
can.
T'POL: Murderer!
ARCHER: Help me get her out of here. (He helps Hawkins up to the ceiling
hatch.) ARCHER: Malcolm?
REED: Just about there.
ARCHER: (to T'Pol) Come on. Climb! (Vulcans start to force the door
open.) ARCHER: Malcolm!
 [Seleya
Corridor]
 (As
they make their way through the ship there are explosions both inside
and along the hull.)
REED: We don't have much time.
T'POL: No, no, no. (Archer manhandles her along.)
ARCHER: You can't stay here.
REED: Another twenty metres.
HAWKINS: Captain! (Staring at a big multi-deck hole in their path.)
REED: How were you at the long jump.
(They shoot two more Vulcans.)
ARCHER: Watch her. Reed. (They haul a girder in to bridge the gap.
Archer tests it for stability.) ARCHER: Come on, you can make it.
T'POL: Get away from me.
ARCHER: It's okay, I'll help you.
T'POL: Touch me and I'll kill you. (She lunges for him so he stuns her
and carries her across the girder in a fireman's lift, as the others
ward off the Vulcans,)
REED: Go. I said, go! (First Hawkins then Reed cross the girder with
the Vulcans in pursuit.)
HAWKINS: Give me a hand. (Hawkins and Archer pull up the bulkhead keeping
them from the docking hatch and use a spare grill to keep it open,
while Reed dislodges the girder to leave the Vulcans raging on the
other side. Once they are all through, the grill is pushed away and the
bulkhead drops again.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 REED:
What's wrong?
ARCHER: I can't release the docking clamps. Full power to thrusters.
HAWKINS: We're being hailed.
 [Shuttlepod
two]
 TUCKER:
Are you all right, Captain?
ARCHER [OC]: The docking
 [Shuttlepod]
 ARCHER:
clamps are jammed. We could use a hand.
TUCKER [OC]: Stand by. (They phaser the pod free.) TUCKER [OC]: You're clear, sir.
ARCHER: The ship's about to blow. Get the hell out of here.
(The elegant curved Seleya goes to pieces in a very bang.) ARCHER: Archer to shuttlepod two. Are you still in one piece?
TUCKER [OC]: We're fine, sir. See you back on Enterprise.
 [Launch
bay]
 TUCKER:
We got over   sixty kilos. That should be enough
to line the forward hull.
ARCHER: It may be a while before Phlox finds a way to inoculate T'Pol.
Take this to Cargo bay one. Store it in the biohazard locker.
TUCKER: Aye, sir.
 [Sickbay]
ARCHER: How'd it go?
PHLOX: You got her out in time, Captain. Her synaptic pathways are
mending nicely, but it will be a few days before she fully regains
control of her emotions.
ARCHER: I'd like to talk with her.
(Phlox wakes her with a hypospray)
ARCHER: Phlox was able to help you. You're going to be okay.
T'POL: The Seleya?
ARCHER: It was destroyed. I'm sorry, but I didn't have a choice.
PHLOX: They were beyond help. Their fate was sealed long before we
arrived. (to Archer) Please don't be long. (leaves)
T'POL: Was Commander Tucker successful?
ARCHER: Yes and no. He collected a good supply of trellium, but it
turns out it was trellium that poisoned the Vulcan crew and you.
T'POL: It's essential you protect this ship. Leave me on the next
habitable planet.
ARCHER: I'm not going to do that.
T'POL: You can't allow your concern for a single crewman to affect your
mission. This Expanse destroyed everyone aboard the Seleya. Don't let
it happen to Enterprise.
ARCHER: We'll find a way through this, but I won't leave anyone behind.
Not if I can help it. I can't try to save humanity without holding on
to what makes me human.
 [Mess
hall - movie night]
PHLOX: Something tells me we haven't seen the last of the detective in
the bow tie.
TUCKER: No, he died in a house fire.
PHLOX: Ah, did he? The autopsy was inconclusive. I wouldn't be
surprised if the body belonged to the delivery man with the strange
limp. You never did see him leave the house.
TUCKER: What about the gardener? He was there too.
PHLOX: Too tall. Even the primitive forensics of the mid-twentieth
century would have determined that.
T'POL: Perhaps we should watch, and find out.
TUCKER: Part of the fun of a mystery is trying to solve it before it
ends, using logic. You of all people should appreciate that.
T'POL: Then use logic more quietly.
ARCHER [OC]: All hands report to stations. Tactical alert.
(As T'Pol stands in the turbolift, she sees a zombie Vulcan from the Seleya
and fights with him. She's back on the Seleya with explosions and
attackers all around her, speaking her name.)
 [Sickbay]
(T'Pol wakes with a start, terrified.)
PHLOX: It's all right. You're on Enterprise. You're safe.

Exile
Original Airdate: 15 Oct, 2003
  [Hoshi's quarters]
 (Hoshi
is in her bathroom when she hears a soft voice.)
TARQUIN [OC]: Hoshi. (She goes into her living quarters.)
HOSHI: Hello?
TARQUIN [OC]: Do you understand me? I think you do. Can you see me?
(There's a shadowy figure in the corner.)
HOSHI: Ensign Sato to Security.
REED [OC]: Go ahead. (the figure is gone) Hoshi? Is everything all
right? Hoshi?
 [Command
Centre]
 ARCHER:
I thought I was the only one who lived here during my off hours.
T'POL: I'd like you to see this. These are the locations where we've
encountered spatial anomalies. I analysed the sensor logs from the
Xindi database. These are the co-ordinates where that vessel was
affected.
ARCHER: Seems pretty random.
T'POL: That's what I thought, until I ran a vector analysis of the
gravimetric waves coming from the sphere we discovered. The
interference patterns implied another wave source.
ARCHER: A second sphere.
T'POL: It appears so. The simulation suggests that the anomalies occur
where the waves intersect.
ARCHER: If you're right, then we should be able to start predicting
where we're going to run into trouble.
T'POL: If we're going to create an accurate map, we'll need precise
measurements of the sphere's gravimetric fields.
ARCHER: Assuming there is a second sphere, how far away is it?
T'POL: Less than four light years.
ARCHER: Set a course.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI:
Nothing?
REED: I ran every scan in the book. There's no sign of any intruder
anywhere on the ship.
HOSHI: Maybe our sensors missed something.
REED: I went through all the logs for the last twenty four hours. To
say they were uneventful would be an understatement. This is good news.
HOSHI: That I'm imagining things?
REED: You're a little on edge. It's not uncommon to see the enemy out
of the corner of your eye.
HOSHI: I thought that was called paranoia.
REED: Whatever it is, it's not uncommon. Just the other night I thought
I heard clicking sounds in my quarters. For a moment, I could have
sworn there was a Xindi Insectoid lurking in the shadows.
HOSHI: What I saw wasn't a shadow.
REED: All right, I'll keep an eye out.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX:
There's some mild vasodilation in the pre-frontal cortex. That would
account for your headaches. Other than that, you're in perfect health.
HOSHI: Are there any more tests that you can run?
PHLOX: What do you expect me to find?
HOSHI: The last few days I've had the strangest feeling that I am being
watched. I've heard whispering down corridors, in my quarters. Could I
have been exposed to something that's making me hallucinate?
PHLOX: There's no evidence of any mind-altering substances on board.
HOSHI: So basically this is all in my head.
PHLOX: It appears to be.
HOSHI: Great.
PHLOX: I suppose you believe you're dealing badly with stress.
HOSHI: It's not a good sign when you start to see things that aren't
there.
PHLOX: Well, that's a matter of opinion. On Denobula, when a person
under stress hallucinates it's considered healthy. A harmless way for
the subconscious to release nervous energy. I've always envied those
who had that facility. I tend to keep too much bottled up inside.
HOSHI: I should get going. T'Pol's asked me to translate a section of
the Xindi database.
 [Command
centre]
 TARQUIN
[OC]: Hoshi. (All the computer screens change to an image of a planet.)
TARQUIN [OC]: That's where I'm waiting for you. That's where I'm waiting for you.
HOSHI: Ensign Sato to Lieutenant Reed. I need help in the Command
Centre.
TARQUIN: Hoshi.
HOSHI: Who are you?
TARQUIN: Don't be frightened. (The screens change to a picture of her.)
TARQUIN: Hoshi.
HOSHI: How did you get on board?
TARQUIN: I'm nowhere near your ship.
HOSHI: What do you want?
TARQUIN: You're searching for something. I can help.
(She sees a strange corridor, a stone one with light fittings, rugs.
She runs, bursts through a pair of doors onto a balcony looking out
over a cliff face. There's a hand on her shoulder.)
REED: Hoshi. You all right?
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX:
I'm not picking up anything out of the ordinary.
REED: We still haven't found any ships nearby or any uninvited guests
on board.
HOSHI: I am not imagining it, Captain.
ARCHER: You have to admit it's a possibility.
HOSHI: With respect, sir, I know that my mind can be overactive
sometimes, but that is not what's happening. This is real.
ARCHER: I want you to keep Hoshi under observation until we can sort
this out. Post a security detail outside, and assign teams to
Engineering and the Armoury until further notice.
REED: Are you expecting an attack, sir?
ARCHER: Around here, you never know. I'll see you both in the morning.
(Reed and Archer leave.)
HOSHI: Isn't it about feeding time?
PHLOX: I'll take care of it after I get you settled.
HOSHI: Would you mind? I'm really not that tired.
PHLOX: Be my guest. The Vulcan root-leaf's in that container. (She feeds something in an aquarium.)
HOSHI: That's strange. It's. When
the alien communicates with me, it's almost like he's inside my head,
looking at things through my eyes, experiencing what I'm experiencing,
and talking to him is like talking to myself. Does that make any sense?
PHLOX: It makes perfect sense. Listening to your thoughts has been very
pleasurable.
HOSHI: What?
PHLOX: I've been with you for several days. Studying your mind, your
memories. Learning so many things about you.
HOSHI: Why me?
PHLOX: My telepathy only works in rare instances. It takes a unique
mind to process it. Yours is the first I've found in many years.
HOSHI: What do you want? (The scene changes to a conservatory.)
TARQUIN: I'm only three light years away. My home is what you're seeing
right now. All I want is to meet you.
HOSHI: I don't think that'll be possible.
TARQUIN: I know you're on an urgent mission. That's what I want to talk
to you about.
 [Ready
room]
 ARCHER:
What did he tell you about the Xindi?
HOSHI: He's saving that for my visit.
ARCHER: He could have given you something as a show of good faith. This
could be another attempt by the Xindi to infiltrate Enterprise.
HOSHI: I think he wants to help. He was horrified that seven million of
us were killed. He says he's willing to use his abilities to help us
find the Xindi. I think that's reason enough to meet with him.
ARCHER: Archer to Mayweather.
TRAVIS [OC]: Go ahead, sir.
ARCHER: We're taking a slight detour.
 [Tarquin's
study]
(Enterprise arrives at a planet with turquoise oceans, and the
shuttlepod takes Archer, Reed and Hoshi down to a home built into a
craggy mountain peak. The front doors open on their own and they go
into a corridor like the one Hoshi ran down. She goes straight to
another pair of doors and opens them. They enter a room
lit by lots of candles in wall sconces, and with a fire burning in the
grate.)
TARQUIN: I asked Hoshi to come alone.
ARCHER: The Captain's always a part of first contact missions. Star
Fleet regulations. I hope that's not a problem.
TARQUIN: Not at all, Captain. (In Hoshi's head he looked human, but
he's more reptilian with things sticking out of his head.) TARQUIN: I'm pleased
all three of you could come. My name is Tarquin. I'm obviously not what
you expected. I didn't want to frighten you, so I created a human image
when I contacted you on Enterprise. Thank you for coming to me.
ARCHER: You said you could help us with our mission.
TARQUIN: You're searching for a weapon that could annihilate your
planet. I may be able to find it, but I'll need an object that's
associated with the Xindi.
REED: Why?
TARQUIN: Every artifact retains an imprint of the people who made it,
who used it. I have the ability to sense those imprints.
ARCHER: I can arrange to have something sent down. How much time would
you need with it?
TARQUIN: No more than a few days.
REED: We didn't pick up any other biosigns. I take it you live here
alone.
TARQUIN: Alone.
REED: It's an awfully big planet for one person.
TARQUIN: I've lived here for a very long time, Mister Reed. My only
contact with the outside world has been through telepathy. Bring me the
artefact. I'd like to get started.
ARCHER: We'll be back as soon as we can.
TARQUIN: Captain, one small request. I'd like Hoshi to stay with me
while I'm working.
ARCHER: I'm afraid that's not appropriate.
TARQUIN: Nonetheless, it's a condition of my helping you.
 [Ready
room]
 HOSHI:
If I'm comfortable with this. I don't get the sense that he would harm
me.
ARCHER: My instincts tell me otherwise. He's hiding something.
REED: If he's insistent, we could put off looking for the sphere, stay
in orbit. It's only for a few days.
HOSHI: We don't have the luxury of dealing with one problem at a time
anymore, sir. If he can tell us something about the Xindi weapon it's
worth the risk. I can take care of myself, Captain.
 [Tarquin's
study]
 (Archer
opens a case containing the 'future' element of the Xindi weapon.)
TARQUIN: This is from the weapon that attacked your planet.
ARCHER: We think it was a prototype. From a much larger weapon.
TARQUIN: This will be very useful. May I? (Tarquin takes Hoshi's overnight bag,
gently touching her hand)
HOSHI: Thanks. I need a minute.
TARQUIN: Take your time. (He leaves.)
ARCHER: Do I have to tell you to stay on your toes?
HOSHI: I think that falls under the goes without saying category, sir.
ARCHER: Did you bring a phase pistol?
HOSHI: I'll keep it under my pillow.
ARCHER: You know how to reach me.
 [Tarquin's
dining room]
 (A big
table is laid with silverware and candles.)
HOSHI: Do you always eat like this?
TARQUIN: Only when I have company.
HOSHI: Thank you. (sits)
TARQUIN: I thought you might enjoy something familiar. (He lifts the lid
on a slice of pizza, and other earth foods.) TARQUIN: Programming these dishes
was a challenge. I had to recreate their tastes and textures from your
memory. Please. (She tries the pizza.) TARQUIN: It should approximate the recipe
from Fiorella's on Fountain Street in San Francisco.
HOSHI: You have certainly done your homework.
TARQUIN: I've enjoyed it.
HOSHI: What's this?
TARQUIN: Dessert. (He displays an alien dish.) TARQUIN: It's a delicacy from the
Arakon system. I think you'll like it.
HOSHI: You know, my stomach is a little unsettled.
TARQUIN: You told your grandmother that every time she tried to serve
you soba noodles. Now it's one of your favourite foods. (He sits at the
opposite end of the table.)
HOSHI: Since you seen to know so much about my past, I think it's only
fair that I know a little about yours. Where are you from?
TARQUIN: My homeworld is thirty light years from here. A wonderful
place to live, provided you're not born telepathic. The odds are one in
fifty million. I was among the unlucky few. We're considered a threat
to the rest of the population. There's only one solution for people
like me. To live out our lives in exile. So we're sent to places like
this. (raises his glass) To solitude. I think you're familiar with it.
HOSHI: What do you mean?
TARQUIN: Your parents learned you were gifted, so you spent your
childhood with private tutors, studying languages. You thought it was
normal to go through your days alone. I'm sorry, I forget you're
unaware of how much I know about you.
HOSHI: Are you reading my mind continuously?
TARQUIN: Not since you arrived. Now that you're here with me I would
rather get to know you the way other humans do.
HOSHI: This is great, but I'm pretty tired.
TARQUIN: Of course.
 [Hoshi's
bedroom]
TARQUIN: If you need anything else, let me know at supper tomorrow.
I'll be working most of the day. Feel free to wander. There are a lot
of interesting things here, but I strongly suggest that you stay
inside. The winds can be treacherous.
HOSHI: I'm sure there's enough to keep me occupied.
TARQUIN: If you'd like, you could spend some time looking at this. It's
written in a dead language, over a thousand years old. Everything about
these people, their homeworld, their culture, has vanished into time.
HOSHI: Thank you.
TARQUIN: You don't have to feel alone.
HOSHI: I won't, I'll be busy with this.
TARQUIN: That's not what I meant. You often feel isolated, even around
other people. You don't have to.
 [Archer's
quarters]
(Archer is glaring at his water polo ball stuck halfway through the bulkhead.)
 ARCHER:
Archer to the Bridge.
T'POL [OC]: Yes, Captain.
ARCHER: I assume we're getting close?
T'POL [OC]: You assume correctly.
ARCHER: Take us out of warp. I'm on my way.
T'POL [OC]: Yes, sir.
(On his journey, he sees a bulkhead ripple, and in the Armoury the main
steps buckle then flip completely over.)
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Status.
T'POL: We're getting reports of anomalies on all decks.
(One goes around the bridge bulkhead, blowing up circuits, before
travelling down the forward hull and blasting a hole in it leaving
girders and circuits exposed. Archer helps a crewman get up.) ARCHER: I got you.
T'POL: Breaches on decks B, C and E. Emergency bulkheads are in place
but three subsections have decompressed.
(The Bridge structure ripples again.)
REED: We're losing structural integrity in the forward hull. (The helmsman is not Travis.)
ARCHER: All stop! The anomalies are stronger
here.
T'POL: If there is another sphere in the region, it's emitting a lot
more gravimetric energy than the first one.
ARCHER: Which means if we continue, there's a good chance the ship is
going to get torn apart. If it is there, how far?
T'POL: Approximately seventy five thousand kilometres.
REED: It might as well be seventy five thousand light years.
ARCHER: Bridge to Commander Tucker.
TUCKER [OC]: Go ahead.
ARCHER: How are your engines
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER
[OC]: Holding up?
TUCKER: So far, so good, but I wouldn't recommend putting them through
a lot more of this.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
How long would it take you to insulate a shuttlepod with trellium-D.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER:
I'd need a day to refine enough ore and at least twelve hours
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER
[OC]: To reconfigure the hull.
ARCHER: Get started.
TUCKER [OC]: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: Hold our position. (to T'Pol) You might want to steer clear of
the Launch bay for the next couple of days.
T'POL: Indeed.
 [Tarquin's
study]
 (Hoshi
has changed into a short blue halterneck dress, and is strolling about.
Through a metal grill, she sees her host at his desk, holding a bright
blue egg-shaped device. He senses her and looks up.)
HOSHI: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.
TARQUIN: Not at all. Please. (Before she comes through the door, he
turns the 'egg' off.) TARQUIN: Have you had a chance to look at the book I gave
you?
HOSHI: I'm about halfway through.
TARQUIN: I didn't expect you to translate it so quickly.
HOSHI: Aren't you supposed to know me better than that?
TARQUIN: What did you think of it?
HOSHI: It's an interesting language, reminds me of medieval Klingon.
Any progress?
TARQUIN: A few images, impressions. Did you know that there are five
Xindi species?
HOSHI: That's what we've heard.
TARQUIN: There's a great deal of conflict among them. They don't trust
one another.
HOSHI: Do you know where they're building the weapon?
TARQUIN: Not yet. I'm going to need more time.
HOSHI: What's this? (The egg.)
TARQUIN: It helps me extend the range of my telepathy. My family gave
it to me when I was exiled. Without it, I never would have found you.
Would you like to try?
HOSHI: Is that possible?
TARQUIN: With guidance. (She sits in his chair and the egg glows blue.)
TARQUIN: If you close your eyes, you begin to sense light and colour. Let the
images take shape. Let the shapes become more distinct. Can you see
them?
HOSHI: I think so.
TARQUIN: You're trying too hard to find them. Let the images come to
you. (A series of pictures flash past, some from past episodes, some
not. It finishes with a Xindi Reptilian.)
HOSHI: How do you make sense of all
that?
TARQUIN: It takes practice. Try again. (He puts his hands over hers.)
HOSHI: Maybe later. I should let you get back to your work.
TARQUIN: Feel free to return, if you'd like some company.
HOSHI: Thanks.
(She wanders though the conservatory, then out onto a)
 [Balcony]
 (It's
cold and windy. She sees a series of gravestones ranged below in the
dusting of snow.)
TARQUIN: I asked you to stay inside!
HOSHI: Is this why you didn't want me out here? Who are they?
TARQUIN: They're people I knew. The last one died over a century ago.
We should go inside.
HOSHI: How did they die?
TARQUIN: Very few lifespans are as long as mine.
HOSHI: How old are you?
TARQUIN: I was born over four hundred years ago.
HOSHI: Who were they?
TARQUIN: The first one was Morianna Taal. She was my first companion.
Like you, she had a unique mind.
HOSHI: And the other three?
TARQUIN: Companions as well. When I lost Morianna I began to search for
another, then another. Sometimes I don't know what is worse, being
alone or having to bury the people I've come to care about. It's been
many years since I found someone like you.
HOSHI: You're right. We should go back inside.
TARQUIN: All I'm asking is that you consider the possibility.
HOSHI: You know that Enterprise is on an important mission. I just
can't abandon my duties.
TARQUIN: It's possible that with my help your mission will be over
soon.
HOSHI: Do you really expect me to spend the rest of my life on a
desolate world with someone I have known for less than two days?
TARQUIN: The others had similar doubts, but over time they came to
appreciate what I had to offer them. No one will ever understand you
the way I can.
HOSHI: I am grateful for your help and I'm happy to stay here while you
work, but I have no intention of becoming your next companion.
 [Conservatory]
 (She
leaves the alien Tarquin behind, and walks straight into the human
version.)
HOSHI: If you think projecting yourself as human is going to make me
change my mind, you're mistaken.
TARQUIN: You've let your fear of the unknown stand in your way far too
many times. You almost left Enterprise early in it's mission because
you didn't think you could control your fears. But in spite of that,
you stayed. It strengthened you. This situation is no different.
HOSHI: You obviously misinterpreted a few memories, because this
situation is very different.
TARQUIN: I'm giving you the chance to experience something you've
searched for your entire life. It's the reason you study languages, to
make unique connections with people.
HOSHI: I don't need you to help me do that.
TARQUIN: Then why do you seem so isolated? You live on a ship filled
with your own people and yet there are many times when you feel alone.
Stay with me. I'll teach you ways of sharing thoughts and emotions no
human can.
HOSHI: I already told you, I'm not interested.
TARQUIN: You're lying, Hoshi. I can hear everything you're thinking.
HOSHI: What I'm thinking is none of your business!
TARQUIN: Michio. Your grandfather. He's the last person you were truly
close to, but he died a long time ago.
HOSHI: Leave me alone.
TARQUIN: You can have that kind of connection again.
HOSHI: Leave me alone!
(She goes to leave but he's in front of her again.)
TARQUIN: I'm sorry. I know this must seem overwhelming. Think about
what I've said. You're going to have a great deal of time.
 [Shuttlepod]
 TUCKER:
Sensors say we're passing through a gravimetric distortion.
ARCHER: (piloting) No anomalies.
TUCKER: Trellium seems to be doing it's job.
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise.
T'POL [OC]: Go ahead.
ARCHER: We're approaching seventy nine thousand kilometres. Still no
sign
 [Command
centre]
 ARCHER
[OC]: Of the cloaking barrier.
T'POL: Adjust your heading to oh one six mark two.
ARCHER [OC]: Stand by.
 [Shuttlepod]
(There's a judder.)
TUCKER: That felt promising.
 [Command
centre]
 T'POL:
I believe you just grazed the perimeter. Turn starboard three point six
degrees.
 [Shuttlepod]
 (The
pod shakes.)
ARCHER: I think we've found it.
T'POL [OC]: Maintain course. You should be heading directly towards the
cloaking barrier.
TUCKER: Power's fluctuating.
(The ride gets rough, then we see the pod disappear.)
ARCHER: Hull integrity?
TUCKER: Some microfractures, but nothing we can't handle. (power fails)
Switching to backup.
(They emerge from the cloaking field.)
ARCHER: Trip. (There's a sphere in front of them.) ARCHER: Let's get going with
the scans.
TUCKER: Ah, hell.
ARCHER: Is there a problem?
TUCKER: The sensor relays were damaged.
ARCHER: How much time do you need?
TUCKER: Not long, but we'll have to get back to Enterprise. I need to
open up the circuit housings on the undercarriage. No way to get to
them from the inside.
ARCHER: Bring the descent thrusters online.
TUCKER: You're not planning to land on that thing?
ARCHER: Thrusters, Trip, and get the EV suits ready.
 [Sphere
surface]
 TUCKER:
Not exactly my idea of shore leave.
ARCHER: Get to work. I'm going to take a look around.
TUCKER: Don't get lost.
(A little while later.)
ARCHER: How's it coming, Trip?
TUCKER: Almost there, sir. Just two more relays. (Flash, bang.) TUCKER: Captain!
(With one thruster firing, the pod lifts off slowly on it's own.)
ARCHER: What happened?
TUCKER: The port thruster ignited.
ARCHER: I can see that.
TUCKER: When I was bypassing the last relay, I must have triggered a
surge in the propulsion system. Son of a bitch! (The pod rotates gently
as it goes higher and higher.) TUCKER: It's going to be a long time before
Enterprise decides to come looking for us.
ARCHER: Can we launch without a port thruster?
TUCKER: We can sure as hell try.
(They both draw phase pistols.)
ARCHER: Whoever gets the first clear shot. (He fires.)
TUCKER: Careful, sir. That was awfully close to the O2 recycler. (Tucker fires
twice.) TUCKER: I need to spend more time in the Armoury. (They fire together, down
it bounces and slides to a stop in front of them.)
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER
[OC]: Archer to Enterprise.
T'POL: We're here, Captain.
ARCHER [OC]: It was right where you said it was, T'Pol. We got all the
scans you asked for.
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. While T'Pol analyses the data from the
sphere, we set a course to pick up Ensign Sato and find out if the
alien learned anything about the Xindi.
 [Hoshi's
bedroom]
(There's a knock on the door, then it opens.)
TARQUIN: May I come in? I won't be long. I just heard from your
Captain. Enterprise will be here in a few minutes. I have learned a
great deal about the Xindi weapon. I'm sure he'll find the information
useful.
HOSHI: Thank you for all your help.
TARQUIN: Have you given any more thought to my offer?
HOSHI: I can't stay here, you know that.
TARQUIN: I understand. I was foolish to think it was even a
possibility.
HOSHI: The next time you invite someone for a visit, you might want to
let them know you're looking for a life-long companion.
TARQUIN: I won't forget. Please keep the book as a reminder of your
time here.
HOSHI: I was hoping you'd say that. I'm nearly done, and I'm anxious to
see how it ends.
TARQUIN: After I've briefed Captain Archer, I'll send him to you. It
was a privilege knowing you.
(Later, she's finishing putting on her uniform when a smiling Archer
appears.)
ARCHER: How was your stay?
HOSHI: It'll be good to get back to Enterprise.
ARCHER: I'm sure. If it's any consolation, your time here was well
spent. We've learnt more about the Xindi than I expected, and he's
offered to keep supplying us with information for as long as we're in
range, thanks to you.
HOSHI: Glad I could help, sir.
ARCHER: There is one condition. He wants you to stay with him while he
continues his work.
HOSHI: I assume you told him that wouldn't be possible.
ARCHER: I won't order you to do this, Hoshi, but it may be our best
chance of finding the weapon before it's too late. With any luck, it'll
only take a few weeks, maybe a month. We'd come back for you as soon as
the mission's over. I don't need to tell you what's at stake, Ensign.
HOSHI: I'll go back to my quarters and pick up a few things.
ARCHER: Thank you, Hoshi. There's no reason for you to leave. Just give
me a list of what you need and I'll have it sent down.
HOSHI: I should brief my replacement on the UT upgrades.
ARCHER: We'll take care of it. Don't worry.
HOSHI: At least give me a chance to say goodbye to the crew!
ARCHER: I wish there was time.
HOSHI: It won't take long. Sir, I might not see my friends again.
ARCHER: I'm sure Travis will understand.
HOSHI: Travis?
ARCHER: Travis and the others. They realise how important this is.
HOSHI: I was just thinking about Travis. You're a regular mind reader.
ARCHER: We've known each other a long time.
HOSHI: Where is Captain Archer?
ARCHER: We'll be back for you as soon as we can.
HOSHI: Where is he?
ARCHER: Hoshi.
HOSHI: Where is Captain Archer!
ARCHER: Hoshi. (He reaches for her and she shrugs him off.)
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Open a channel to Ensign Sato.
COMM. OFFICER: Our signal's not getting through, sir. There's some kind
of disruption field. (The lights flicker.)
REED: Sir.
ARCHER: What's going on?
REED: My station's down.
T'POL: Everything's going offline. Main and auxiliary power, warp
engines, life support.
 [Tarquin's
study]
 HOSHI:
Nice try. What were you planning to tell my Captain when he got back?
Were you going to appear as me and beg him to let me stay? No, you
can't do that, can you? I'm the only one on board that you can play
your tricks with.
TARQUIN: Enterprise has already returned. Their fate in in your hands.
HOSHI: What is that supposed to mean?
TARQUIN: I can't let you leave, Hoshi. I've waited too long to find
you.
HOSHI: What's happened to Enterprise?
TARQUIN: If you agree to stay, they won't be harmed. They'll be free to
leave orbit.
HOSHI: Let me speak to Captain Archer.
TARQUIN: That's not possible.
HOSHI: Why the hell not?
TARQUIN: You'll be happy here, I promise you.
HOSHI: Why can't I speak to Captain Archer?
TARQUIN: There's no power on your vessel, and there won't be until you
agree to remain with me.
HOSHI: You would kill over eighty people to keep me here?
TARQUIN: I don't want to kill anyone. That's why it's essential that
you agree to stay. (she picks up his telepathy enhancer) You mustn't do
that. It's very fragile.
HOSHI: I'm counting on that. Now, undo whatever you've done to my ship
or you will never contact anyone again with this thing.
TARQUIN: An empty threat, Hoshi. As long as you're with me I won't need
to contact anyone else.
HOSHI: As long as I'm with you. Another sixty, seventy years, and then
what. (holds it ready to drop on the floor) What'll you do when I'm
grave number five out there? Without this you will never find another
companion. You will be alone for the rest of your life.
TARQUIN: Please, think of what I can offer you.
HOSHI: This is your last chance.
 [Bridge]
(The lights come back on.)  ARCHER:
Report.
T'POL: Power's returning to all systems.
ARCHER: Malcolm.
REED: Weapons are coming back online.
ARCHER: Tactical alert.
REED: Aye, sir.
COMM. OFFICER: It's Ensign Sato.
ARCHER: Put her through.
HOSHI [OC]: Captain, are you all right?
ARCHER: We are now. What the hell's going on?
HOSHI [OC]: I think it's time to come get me.
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Ensign Sato has returned to
Enterprise, but without any new information on the Xindi. I'm hoping
T'Pol's analysis of the second sphere will bring better news.
 [Command
centre]
 ARCHER:
What have you got?
T'POL: The data you collected allowed me to create a nearly accurate
map of the anomalies.
ARCHER: Nearly?
T'POL: These are the coordinates where we've encountered strong
anomalies.
ARCHER: The waves aren't intersecting where they're supposed to.
T'POL: Exactly. The locations are being influenced by more than two
gravimetric sources.
ARCHER: A third sphere?
T'POL: A third sphere would correct some of the error but not all of
it, so I had the computer run a covariant extrapolation.
ARCHER: How many?
T'POL: We'll need to get farther into the Expanse to be certain, but,
at least fifty.
(The main display is awash with dots and interconnecting lines.)
ARCHER: Fifty man-made spheres, each one the size of a small moon.
T'POL: And each one generating massive amounts of gravimetric energy.
ARCHER: Did it ever occur to you that whoever built these things may
have done it to create the Expanse?
T'POL: Why would someone want to create a web of crippling anomalies?
 [Hoshi's
quarters]
 (She's
finishing reading the book.)
HOSHI: What are you doing here?
TARQUIN: Did you enjoy the ending?
HOSHI: You can't do this. I don't want you watching me.
TARQUIN: This is the last time, I promise. I've brought you information
to give to your Captain.
HOSHI: Why now?
TARQUIN: You're on a dangerous mission. I don't want to see you harmed.
Who knows, you may change your mind about me someday.
 [Ready
room]
 ARCHER:
Come in. (Hoshi enters with a PADD.) ARCHER: I thought I told you to get some
rest.
HOSHI: He came to my quarters.
ARCHER: I was afraid that might happen.
HOSHI: He gave me these coordinates.
ARCHER: What are they for?
HOSHI: A Xindi colony. He said they're building part of the weapon
there.

The Enterprise Transcripts - The Shipment
The
  Shipment
    Original Airdate: Oct 29, 2003
[Command centre]
      TARQUIN [OC]: Hoshi.
ARCHER [OC]: Previously on Star Trek Enterprise.
      TARQUIN [OC]: I know you're on an urgent mission.
      HOSHI: Who are you?
      TARQUIN [OC]: Don't be frightened.
      HOSHI: What do you want?
      TARQUIN [OC]: You're searching for something. I can help. HOSHI [OC]: He was horrified that seven million of us were killed. He says he's willing to
      use his abilities to help us find the Xindi.
      HOSHI [Tarquin's study]: What's this?
      TARQUIN: It helps me extend the range of my telepathy. HOSHI [Ready room]: He gave me these co-ordinates.
      ARCHER: Where are they for?
      HOSHI: A Xindi colony. He said they're building part of the weapon there.
 [Weapon construction area]
      DEGRA: We're preparing to test the weapon on an uninhabited planet in the Calindra system,
      but we're going to need another shipment of kemocite. At least one hundred kilograms.
      REPTILIAN: I'll contact Gralik. If the test is successful, how long before we can deploy
      the weapon?
      DEGRA: A matter of weeks.
     
 [Command centre]
      REED: There are no defensive systems?
      T'POL: No active sensor sweeps or artificial satellites, no vessels anywhere in the
      vicinity.
      ARCHER: We've seen how different Xindi technology is. They could have defences we can't detect.
      REED: It's also possible that what we've been told about this colony isn't accurate.
      We're putting a lot of faith in Hoshi's telepathic friend. (Archer brings up sensor readings of the planet.)
      ARCHER: What about these energy readings?
      They could be coming from a weapons complex.
      T'POL: They could also be electrical storms, deposits of diamagnetic ore, or
      ARCHER: Or a glitch in our sensors. I know. But if there's any chance that something on
      that planet could lead us to the Xindi weapon, we have to investigate it. After we
      enter the system we'll stay on the far side of that moon. It should keep us out of view.
      Tell Major Hayes he'll be joining us on a reconnaissance mission. We launch in two hours.
     
 [Shuttlepod]
      ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise.
      T'POL [OC]: Go ahead.
      ARCHER: I've found a landing site twelve kilometres north of the energy readings. Any
      sign they've detected us?
      T'POL [OC]: Scans are still negative. Your signal's breaking up.
      ARCHER: I've set a steep approach vector and we've ionised the hull. It'll help
      disburse any scanning beams.
      T'POL: Acknowledged.
      REED: If anyone sees us, they'll think we're a meteor.
     
 [Forest]
      ARCHER: How much further?
      REED: Eight hundred metres, just over that rise. (A little farther on.) REED: That's definitely the source of the
      energy readings.(Archer looks through his binoculars.)
      ARCHER: They're Xindi.
      HAYES: Reptilian?
      ARCHER: No, one of the other species we saw on the database.
     
 [Bridge]
      ARCHER [OC]: We've picked up readings across the spectrum. Positron emissions, antiproton
      bursts. Whatever they're doing in there, it's using a lot of power.
      T'POL: Corporal Hawkins is standing by with an assault team.
      ARCHER [OC]: Tell him to keep standing by. I'm not ready to send in the troops
      just yet. We've checked out the perimeter of the complex. I think we can get inside
      without being detected.
     
 [Forest]
      ARCHER: We'll maintain communications silence inside the complex. I'll contact
      you at oh four hundred. Archer out.
     
 [Security fence]
      REED: I'm not picking up any security devices.
      ARCHER: What about people?
      REED: Approximately eighty inside the complex, but not within a hundred metres.
      (Archer uses his phaser to cut through the metal grill.)
     
 [Refinery Storage room]
      (One window looks out over a massive industrial area. Reed scans some canisters.)
      REED: Captain. Some kind of radiolytic compound. It doesn't match anything in
      our database. There's several hundred kilograms n this room.
      (A door opens, and the three hide.)
      GRALIK: There were impurities in the last three production cycles.
      SLOTH 2: We found a ruptured seal in the tertiary processing chamber. It's been repaired.
      GRALIK: We'll have to increase the production rate by at least sixty percent. Assign two additional teams.
      SLOTH 3: Degra isn't being realistic. This facility wasn't designed to manufacture such large quantities.
      GRALIK: Your job is to synthesis kemocite. I suggest you get back to it. Have these canisters retested.
      Salvage what you can, then destroy the rest.
      (The two assistants leave, then Gralik notices the empty space and the canister Reed left on a table. He looks around
      warily, then puts it back in the box and leaves.)
     
 [Transporter alcove]
      (One of the canisters is beamed aboard.)
      T'POL: We have it, Captain.
      ARCHER [OC]: I need an analysis as soon as possible.
      T'POL: Acknowledged.
     
 [Forest]
      REED: Captain, this place obviously has something to do with the weapon. It seems to me the
      sooner we put it out of commission, the better.
      HAYES: Two spatial charges. That's all it would take to destroy the complex from orbit.
      ARCHER: That might set them back for a while, but we can't lose sight of our main objective.
      I want to know where they're shipping this kemocite. It could lead us to the weapon.
     
 [Gralik's home]
      (He's walked home from the lab, with a gentle rolling gait, and poured himself a drink when the three come in.)
      ARCHER: I have some questions for you.
      GRALIK: Who are you? What do you want from me? (Archer points his phaser at Gralik.)
      ARCHER: Sit down!
      REED: There's nobody else here, sir. Apparently he lives alone.
      ARCHER: Take watch outside. (Reed and Hayes leave.) ARCHER: What's your name?
      GRALIK: Gralik Durr.
      ARCHER: My name's Jonathan Archer. I'm from Earth.
      GRALIK: Is that supposed to explain why you forced your way into my home?
      ARCHER: Tell me about kemocite.
      GRALIK: It's a multiphasic isotope.
      ARCHER: Used for what?
      GRALIK: There are numerous applications. It depends on the level of refinement.
      ARCHER: You're working with someone named Degra. Who is he?
      GRALIK: That's none of your concern. (Archer closes the door.)
      ARCHER: What's he using it for?
      GRALIK: Kemocite can be used for any number of purposes. I don't make a habit
      of asking our clients what they plan to do with it.
      ARCHER: Maybe you should, because this batch is being used to create a weapon to exterminate my people!
      GRALIK: What?
      ARCHER: I want to know where the weapon is being build and when it's going to be ready.
      GRALIK: I don't know what you're talking about.
      ARCHER: I'm not leaving here until I get the answers I need.
     
 [Science lab]
      T'POL: I managed to identify a sub-quantum imprint. It matches the signature of
      the Xindi probe.
      TUCKER: There's no doubt about it, Captain. This isotope was used in the weapon
      that attacked Earth.
     
 [Outside Gralik's home]
      T'POL [OC]: Have you learnt anything from the interrogation?
      ARCHER: Not yet, but this should help.
      TUCKER [OC]: Something else, Captain.
     
 [Science lab]
      TUCKER: I ran a scan on that rifle we picked up. There it was again, the same
      quantum imprint. I'd like permission to take it apart.
     
 [Outside Gralik's home]
      ARCHER: Go ahead. We'll contact you in a couple of hours.
      T'POL [OC]: Understood.
      REED: Congratulations, sir. Three months ago we entered the Expanse with no
      idea who these Xindi were or how to find them, and now we're about to destroy
      one of their weapons facilities.
      ARCHER: I thought we were here to try and stop a war, not start one.
      REED: They struck first.
      ARCHER: Because they were told we're going to attack them. They think they're
      acting in self-defence. By destroying this complex we'll be confirming their
      worst fears about humanity.
      REED: Let's not forget the seven million people who were killed.
      ARCHER: Have Major Hayes lay down blast suppressors. When this facility goes,
      I don't want to take the rest of the settlement with it.
      REED: What about Gralik, sir? He'll tell them about Enterprise.
      ARCHER: I'll deal with Gralik when the time comes. I don't intend to let
      anyone know we were here.
     
 [Transporter alcove]
      TUCKER: I can't imagine what the Captain wants this for.
      T'POL: He was quite insistent.
      TUCKER: We ran the quantum analysis three times. Doesn't he trust us?
      T'POL: He said he needed it to help prove a point.
      (beams a case down)
     
 [Gralik's home]
      GRALIK: How long are you going to keep me here?
      HAYES: That's up to Captain Archer.
      GRALIK: Well, you can tell him that I'll be in my study.
      HAYES: I'm afraid you're going to have to stay right here.
      GRALIK: I have work to do.
      HAYES: And I'm under orders. Please sit down.
      GRALIK: I've already told you everything I know. (The door opens.) GRALIK: Ah, Captain Archer. I
      was beginning to think you'd forgotten about me. (Hayes leaves.)
      ARCHER: You said you weren't involved in building weapons.
      GRALIK: That's correct.
      ARCHER: Explain this.
      GRALIK: I don't know what this is.
      ARCHER: It's a fragment of a probe that murdered seven million people.
      The dead pilot was Xindi, the alloy is Xindi, and it's imprinted with the
      quantum signature of the compound you produce here. We know you're constructing
      a larger version of the weapon, big enough to destroy a planet. I want to know
      where it's being built!
      GRALIK: You burst into my home, show me some twisted piece of metal and tell me
      it proves I'm a mass murderer? I've never seen your species before. I've never
      heard of a planet called Earth, and whether you believe me or not, I had
      nothing to do with killing millions of its inhabitants.
     
 [Armoury]
      PHLOX: I'm flattered you requested my assistance, Commander, but weaponry isn't
      exactly my area of expertise.
      TUCKER: My scans of this thing showed organic components, and I figured anything
      biological is more your turf than mine. (Tucker opens the top of the rifle to reveal two maggot things.) TUCKER: What do you think?
      PHLOX: They appear to be generating synaptic impulses. (Tucker takes one out with tongs.)
      TUCKER: Is it alive?
      PHLOX: Wouldn't make a very good pet but, definitely organic. (Another worm emerges to
      replace the one Tucker removed from the weapon.) PHLOX: And it appears to have reproductive
      capabilities.
     
 [Gralik's home]
      (Gralik is examining the weapon fragment.)
      GRALIK: The kemocite is extremely refined.
      ARCHER: Did it come from this facility?
      GRALIK: It did. We supply many species with kemocite, not just Xindi.
      It has countless applications. When Degra requested shipments so
      highly refined, we celebrated, realising the wealth it would bring
      to our colony. We never considered why he wanted such pure kemocite.
      Perhaps our greed blinded us from the possibility that it would be used in constructing a weapon.
      ARCHER: Is Degra a reptilian?
      GRALIK: No, he's a Xindi Primate.
      ARCHER: I met one at a mining complex.
      GRALIK: They're similar to you. Ape-like. Degra and his people have
      always been fair, truthful. That may have been why I believed him when
      he said the shipment was for research. Perhaps he's become as untrustworthy
      as the reptilians.
      ARCHER: We've run into a few of them, too. It's hard to imagine five sentient
      species evolving on the same planet.
      GRALIK: Five? I suppose there are, now. (Gralik offers Archer a drink)
      ARCHER: No, thanks.
      GRALIK: Do you mind?
      ARCHER: No, go ahead. (Gralik takes a drink.)
      GRALIK: There was a sixth species, the avians. They've been gone since the war.
      ARCHER: Gone?
      GRALIK: Extinct. As far as I'm told, none of them fled before our homeworld was destroyed.
      ARCHER: We found some debris. How did it happen?
      GRALIK: The war went on for nearly a hundred years. The sides changed, alliances were
      forged and then broken. By the time it ended I doubt any of the six species remembered
      what started it, but everyone remembered what ended it. As well as being unstable politically,
      our planet was even more unstable geologically. In a final desperate act, the insectoids and
      reptilians detonated massive explosions beneath the eight largest seismic fissures. I'd like
      to think they didn't realise how devastating the result would be. My grandfather lived there.
      He told me of places where the sky was sometimes filled with avians. Now they're gone.
      ARCHER: The other five species did survive. From what I can tell, they don't all live on
      remote colonies like this one.
      GRALIK: The descendants of those that escaped are scattered across the Expanse. Many live
      peaceful lives, but obviously not all.
      (The door opens.)
      HAYES: Captain.
      ARCHER: I'll be right back.
      HAYES: Sir.
      ARCHER: It's okay.
     
 [Outside Gralik's home]
      HAYES: The suppressors are in place. The blast wave should be mostly confined
      to the facility. Sir, I noticed a lot of activity down there. It seemed like something is going on.
      ARCHER: (into communicator) Archer.
      T'POL [OC]: Captain, we've detected a ship approaching the planet. The hull
      configuration matches the Xindi vessel that attacked us.
      ARCHER: (closing communicator) Reptilians.
     
 [Ridge overlooking refinery]
      (Degra greets the Reptilian delegation, then they speak to Gralik's assistant. Archer hands the binoculars to Reed.)
      ARCHER: Recognise anyone?
      REED: The reptilians seem rather upset about something.
     
 [Sickbay]
      (The weapon is in the Imaging Chamber.)
      TUCKER: You got something?
      PHLOX: I've been running scans of the weapons organic component. It's
      neural pathways appear to help modulate the rifle's power output.
      It's the most sophisticated example of biomechanical engineering I've ever seen.
      TUCKER: You said you had good news, Doc?
      PHLOX: Ah, yes. I've been attempting to break down this creature's immune
      system.
      TUCKER: You're trying to make it sick?
      PHLOX: However, it's proving to be quite resilient. I tried an array of
      viruses and pathogens, but it's immune to all of them. Then I began
      exposing it to various radioactive spectra. A sustained burst of
      delta radiation. (He holds up a jar of dead maggot.)
      TUCKER: If we rig up portable EM emitters we can knock out reptilian
      weapons before any of them get the chance to pull the trigger.
      PHLOX: In theory. Unfortunately, the amount of radiation required would
      be extremely hazardous to any humans in the area.
      TUCKER: It's still a place to start. Great work, Doc. Keep at it.
      PHLOX: And, Commander, I'd avoid exposing any of the Xindi technology
      to omicron radiation. It seems to thrive on it, as you can see. (He goes to another jar of huge maggots.)
      TUCKER: I'll keep that in mind.
     
 [Gralik's home]
      GRALIK: They're ahead of schedule. We weren't expecting them for another
      three days. You might not have much time left to accomplish your mission.
      ARCHER: What makes you say that?
      GRALIK: We've been processing kemocite for them for nearly six months.
      They're here for their final shipment. Captain, I'm the primary
      technician in this facility. They'll want to talk to me before
      accepting delivery, to confirm that all of their technical requirements have been met.
      I may be able to obtain some information for you about this weapon.
      ARCHER: That could be dangerous.
      GRALIK: I'm willing to take that risk.
      ARCHER: How do I know you won't expose us, tell them about Enterprise?
      GRALIK: I'm proud of my craft, Captain. I've practiced it for many years.
      I won't let my work be corrupted in this way. Seven million people. If I'd chosen my clients more carefully,
      that tragedy might not have happened. I don't intend to let it happen again.
      ARCHER: (into communicator) Archer.
      REED [OC]: Captain, there are two Xindi biosigns heading this way. (An arboreal knocks on the door.)
      ARBOREAL [OC]: Gralik, are you there? Gralik? (They leave.)
      GRALIK: Degra's probably wondering where I am. His companions don't like to be kept waiting. (Another knock.)
      REED: Captain. They've gone.
      GRALIK: They'll return. Probably with armed reptilians.
      REED: Just because you didn't show up for work?
      GRALIK: There are fewer than a hundred people on this planet. It
      doesn't go unnoticed when one of them is missing. Degra won't leave
      until he sees the results of the final isotopic analysis. You should reconsider my offer.
     
 [Armoury]
      (Two crewmen are setting up a target.)
      TUCKER: That's good, right there.
      T'POL: Are you sure this is wise?
      TUCKER: That's four inches of solid duranium. If this thing can blast a hole
      through it then we're in even worse trouble than we thought.
      T'POL: Still, it might be prudent to find a more suitable environment to test it.
      TUCKER: We don't have time to go looking for some deserted asteroid if that's what you mean.
      PHLOX: If I may? Commander Tucker and I have learnt all we can from examining the
      workings of the device. A practical test is the next logical step.
      TUCKER: I've rigged up four of Malcolm's force field emitters. They'll contain any blast debris.
      T'POL: What about radiation or particle disbursement? You know nothing about this device.
      TUCKER: That's the point. Those Xindi took out half of our security force
      when they came aboard. Now, if we don't start making some progress
      understanding their weapons, we won't stand a chance in hell of beating them when the time comes.
      T'POL: Let me know when you're ready.
      TUCKER: Give us an hour.
     
 [Refinery control room]
      (Degra is watching the workers when the Reptilian enters.)
      REPTILIAN: More delays?
      DEGRA: We did surprise them by arriving early.
      REPTILIAN: That's no excuse. They should have been ready by now. Such lethargic creatures.
      DEGRA: You could learn something from them. Patience, for example. Where's Gralik?
      ARBOREAL: We can't find him.
      REPTILIAN: In a complex this size, how difficult can it be?
      ARBOREAL 2: We've searched everywhere. No one's seen him.
      ARBOREAL: He often takes walks outside the settlement.
      REPTILIAN: Walks?
      DEGRA: Without his analysis I can't proceed.
      ARBOREAL 2: We've organised search teams.
      REPTILIAN: We don't have time for you to go foraging through the forest. We'll find him ourselves.
     
 [Forest]
      (Reed's scanner beeps.)
      ARCHER: What is it?
      REED: Someone's closing on our position, sir. Four hundred metres.
      ARCHER: Reptilians?
      REED: I'm not certain. Three hundred and fifty metres.
      ARCHER: (to Hayes) Stay with him.
      REED: Still closing, sir. Two hundred metres, one fifty. They're bloody fast, whoever they are. (Archer runs through the trees.)
      ARCHER: Take cover.
(It's two flying devices, and one spots Archer's body heat behind a
tree. He shoots it down. The other one comes up behind Reed and dodges
his first shot, but gets winged with the other and it staggers away
wounded.)
      GRALIK: It's a seeker. The reptilians built them for reconnaissance.
      They were used to great effect during the war. It seems as though you may have been exposed after all.
      ARCHER: Let's hope they didn't get a very good look at us.
      GRALIK: There are some caves not far ahead. They should provide us with some
      cover in case we encounter any more of those.
 [Armoury]
      TUCKER: Ready, Doc?
      PHLOX: Ready.
      (Forcefields on, Tucker pulls the trigger and nothing happens.)
      T'POL: What's wrong?
      TUCKER: It won't fire. I don't understand.
      PHLOX: Perhaps it has a safety device. (There is a clicking sound.)
      T'POL: What's that?
      PHLOX: It's coming from the weapon.
      TUCKER: Looks like some kind of countdown. (T'Pol scans the weapon.)
      T'POL: The energy levels are increasing. It's overloading.
      TUCKER: I can't shut it down. Damn thing's booby-trapped.
      T'POL: If you remove the power cell
      TUCKER: It'll just grow back. 
      (He runs out of the room with the weapon.)
     
 [Transporter alcove]
      (Tucker knocks over a crewmen in the corridor, get to the bay and beams it into space just in time.)
      PHLOX: Quick thinking, Commander.
      TUCKER: You were right. We probably should have found a nice, empty asteroid to test it on.
     
 [Bridge]
      T'POL: The Xindi ship is still in orbit. We haven't detected any other vessels.
     
 [Outside Cave]
      ARCHER: Understood.
      T'POL [OC]: Captain, if the Xindi have detected your presence,
     
 [Bridge]
      T'POL: I strongly urge you to return to the ship.
      ARCHER [OC]: I appreciate your concern.
     
 [Outside Cave]
      ARCHER: But we still have a few loose ends to tie up down here. Archer out. Anything?
      REED: No, sir. We just might have stopped those bloodhounds before they transmitted our
      position.
      ARCHER: Let's hope so.
     
[Inside Cave]
      (They've got a fire going.)
      ARCHER: No sign of the reptilians.
      GRALIK: I doubt they'll find us. That's topaline ore. It should disrupt their scanners.
      Even their seekers won't locate us here. What do you intend to do now, Captain. Destroy our facility?
      Do you plan to wait until I'm back inside or will you simply dispose of me here in the forest?
      ARCHER: I've been considering another option.
      GRALIK: I'd certainly like to hear it.
      ARCHER: The people in this colony had nothing to do with the attack on my planet. I'll be 
      damned if I'm going to make them pay for it. You offered to help us. Are you still willing?
      GRALIK: If you're prepared to trust me.
      ARCHER: Then we'll give them their kemocite, but it won't be exactly what they ordered.
     
 [Outside Cave]
      ARCHER: Make sure he gets home safely.
      HAYES: Yes, sir.
      GRALIK: It would be better if I went alone.
      ARCHER: Good luck.
      GRALIK: And you.
      REED: Permission to speak freely?
      ARCHER: Go ahead.
      REED: I'm not sure it was wise to let him go.
      HAYES: He could lead the reptilians back here.
      ARCHER: Are you speaking freely as well, Major?
      HAYES: Just offering a tactical assessment, sir.
      ARCHER: Noted. He said he'd help us. I believe him.
     
 [Bridge]
      HOSHI: It's the Captain. Go ahead, sir.
      ARCHER [OC]: Tell the Armoury to hold off on those spatial charges. There's been a change of plans.
      T'POL: Is everything all right?
     
 [Outside Cave]
      ARCHER: I'll let you know in a couple of hours. Right now, I have an assignment for you and Hoshi.
     
 [Refinery storage room]
      (Gralik's assistants are putting canisters into boxes.)
      ARBOREAL: They're looking for you.
      GRALIK: Have you started loading the shipment?
      ARBOREAL 2: Not yet.
      GRALIK: Good! I want to run another refinement test.
      ARBOREAL: We've completed three already. The impurities were less than six parts per million.
      GRALIK: We have to be absolutely certain that we've met their specifications.
      You know how important this is to all of us.
      ARBOREAL: We should get started.
      GRALIK: You two perform the isotopic analysis, I'll run the sub-molecular scans.
     
 [Forest]
      (A kemocite canister is beamed to them.)
      ARCHER: We've got it. 
      HOSHI [OC]: We've modified
     
 [Transporter alcove]
      HOSHI: The radiolytic signature. If you can get it onboard their ship, I'll be able to track it.
     
 [Forest]
      ARCHER: Understood.
     
 [Refinery storage area]
      (Gralik is doing his tests when the Reptilian bursts in and grabs his arm.)
      REPTILIAN: Where were you? 
      GRALIK: My personal activities aren't your concern.
      REPTILIAN: And do your personal activities involve destroying one of our seekers?
      GRALIK: I was hunting tree scarabs. Your drone was frightening them.
      REPTILIAN: Who was with you?
      GRALIK: I prefer to spend my time in the forest alone.
      REPTILIAN: Our scans detected other biosigns.
      GRALIK: I was alone.
      DEGRA: If you saw the drone, you knew we were here. Why didn't you return?
      GRALIK: You're two days early.
      DEGRA: What are you doing?
      GRALIK: Running some final tests.
      REPTILIAN: What kind of tests? We were told the shipment was ready.
      GRALIK: Forty two years. That's how long I've been running this facility, and never
      once have I allowed a single gram of kemocite to leave the premises unless
      it was perfectly calibrated. I take pride in my work, but if you're so eager to get underway
      then go ahead, take your shipment. But if it doesn't meet your requirements don't
      expect me to produce another hundred kilograms overnight, because we do have other clients besides you.
      DEGRA: Finish quickly.
     
 [Ridge overlooking refinery]
      REED: There are two of them, loading containers.
      HAYES: Stand by, Captain.
     
 [Refinery fence]
      ARCHER: Acknowledged.
     
 [Ridge overlooking refinery]
      REED: They're heading back.
      HAYES: You're clear, sir. 
      (Archer heads in through the hole he cut earlier. Reed and Hayes watch as he runs over to the Reptilian ship.)
     
 [Bridge]
      REED [OC]: Reed to Enterprise.
      T'POL: Go ahead.
      REED [OC]: The Captain's inside the Xindi shuttle.
      T'POL: Acknowledged.
     
 [Xindi shuttle cargo bay]
      (Archer opens one of the many containers.)
      REED [OC]: Captain, three Xindi have just come out of the complex.
      ARCHER: Understood.
     
 [Bridge]
      T'POL: Lieutenant Reed, report.
      REED: We've run into a small problem. Stand by.
     
 [Outside refinery entrance]
      DEGRA: We appreciate your efforts.
      GRALIK: Perhaps you'll need our services in the future.
      DEGRA: Perhaps.
      (In the shuttle, Archer swaps a canister of kemocite for the modified one.)
      GRALIK: I'll miss the pleasure of your company.
      REPTILIAN: We should go, Degra. We're behind schedule already.
      (Gralik is the only one with a view of the shuttle, and Archer leaving it.)
      GRALIK: We've invested a great deal in this project.
      REPTILIAN: And you've been well paid for it.
      GRALIK: Yes, you've been more than generous, but I'd appreciate it if you could tell me what this shipment
      is being used for. I don't think it's an unreasonable request.
      REPTILIAN: It doesn't concern you.
      DEGRA: It concerns all of us. We've learned there's a threat to our people.
      GRALIK: What kind of threat?
      DEGRA: A ruthless alien species. If we don't act, they'll destroy us.
      (Archer is running off to the hills. The reptilian turns to follow Gralik's gaze and sees nothing)
      GRALIK: I'm glad we could contribute.
      DEGRA: Take pride in what you've done here.
     
 [Bridge]
      ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Enterprise.
      T'POL: Go ahead.
      ARCHER [OC]: What's the status of that Xindi ship?
      TRAVIS: It broke orbit five minutes ago, Captain.
      ARCHER [OC]: Are you picking up the tracking signal?
      HOSHI: Loud and clear.
      ARCHER [OC]: Keep an eye on it. We'll be as soon as we can.
      T'POL: Acknowledged.
     
 [Gralik's home]
(Archer accepts a drink.)       ARCHER: Thank you. Is something wrong?
      GRALIK: I may have just betrayed my people to a ruthless alien species.
      ARCHER: I promise you, you haven't. Please trust me.
      GRALIK: To trust. (they drink)
      ARCHER: Eventually, Degra's going to discover that you sabotaged his kemocite.
      GRALIK: It should delay their progress considerably.
      ARCHER: He'll come back here.
      GRALIK: Don't worry. I can deal with Degra and his friends. You should
      just be concerned with finding this weapon.
      ARCHER: Their ship entered an energy portal after it left orbit. We've lost our tracking signal.
      GRALIK: The portal's range is only a few light years. Keep searching.
      ARCHER: I'd better get back to Enterprise.
      GRALIK: If everything you've told me is true about the attack on your world, I hope you remember
      that all Xindi are not your enemy.
      ARCHER: I will.

 [Archer's
quarters]
(Archer is woken by jolts.)  ARCHER:
Archer to the Bridge.
(He goes into the corridor)
GUARD: I’m sorry sir. I’ve orders to keep you here.
ARCHER: Orders? From whom?
GUARD: The Captain. (There's another jolt, then Archer hits him.)
[Bridge]
REED:
We’re losing forward hull plating! (T'Pol is in Starfleet uniform.)
T'POL: Target their engines.
REED: No effect.
ARCHER: What the hell’s going on?
T'POL: Someone take him back to his quarters!
(Two crewmen grab him.)
REED: Weapons are offline.
HOSHI: Captain!
(Everyone stares in horror at the viewscreen, as the Xindi weapon
blasts Earth into tiny pieces.)
 [Archer
and T'Pol's home]
 (Archer
wakes in a light, airy room. His hair is shot through with grey. He
goes through to the kitchen where T'Pol is pouring orange juice.)
ARCHER: Hello?
T'POL: You’re up early.
ARCHER: T’Pol?
T'POL: I know this all seems unfamiliar. I promise I’ll explain
everything. Why don’t you sit down. Breakfast is almost ready.
ARCHER: Where are we?
T'POL: Jonathan, please, sit down. I’ll answer all of your questions.
Today is a very important day. I have a great deal to tell you. What’s
the last thing you remember?
ARCHER: I was in the Command centre looking at long range scans.
T'POL: Do you remember what happened after you left the Command centre?
ARCHER: We were in a corridor. You and I, on our way to the Bridge.
T'POL: This will be difficult for you to accept, but that was twelve
years ago.
[Corridor]
ARCHER:
You coming tonight?
T'POL: I hadn’t planned on it.
ARCHER: I can make movie night mandatory for senior officers. You’ll
enjoy it. Rosemary’s Baby, it’ll scare the hell out of you. (The ship
shudders.)ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge. Report.
[Bridge]
REED:
There’s a power surge in the starboard nacelle. It seems to have been
caused by an anomaly.
ARCHER [OC]: Take us out of warp.
TRAVIS: The helm’s not responding. The starboard injectors are fused.
HOSHI: I’m reading more anomalies ahead.
REED: After course. Twenty degrees to port.
[Corridor]
(An
anomaly rips alone the corridor. They run to a junction but bulkheads
blow out and T'Pol's foot is trapped by debris. Archer tries to free
her.)
T'POL: You have to get out of here!
ARCHER: I’m not leaving you. (Another anomaly comes down the corridor,
throwing him back and rippling through him.)
 [Sickbay]
PHLOX:
How do you feel?
ARCHER: Like a shuttle pod landed on my head. Was anyone else hurt?
PHLOX: No. Captain, there are a few questions I have to ask you.
ARCHER: Well, it'll have to wait. I want to get to the Bridge. (He gets up
and fetches his uniform.)
PHLOX: I’m afraid I have to insist. When did you last speak to
Commander Tucker?
ARCHER: This morning, staff briefing. Why? What’s going on, Phlox?
PHLOX: The anomaly in the corridor left something behind. We’ve never
seen it before. This is a microcellular scan of your hippocampus.
You’ve been infected by several clusters of parasites. They haven’t
caused any tissue damage but they’re impairing certain synaptic
functions. They’re preventing you from forming new long term memories.
ARCHER: Long term.
PHLOX: You can recall events that happened before the infection, but
everything after fades within a few hours. Captain, you’ve been in
Sickbay for the past three days. You last spoke to Commander Tucker
about seven hours ago. He came to see you, right here.
ARCHER: You can’t remove these parasites?
PHLOX: So far, they haven’t responded to any traditional therapies, but
I’m synthesising an antigen that shows some promise. You can be assured
I won’t stop working on this until I find a cure.
T'POL [OC]: The doctor continued to search for a remedy over the next
several weeks. Commander Tucker and I did our best to keep you updated
each day on the progress of our mission.
[Captain's
mess]
TUCKER:
It looked like we had a lead on that Xindi ship, the one we planted
that tracking devise on, but it turned out to be a garbage scow.
T'POL: They were carrying a shipment with the same radiolytic
signature.
ARCHER: I had an idea this morning, after you told me what happened. I
came up with a way to upgrade the antimatter inducers. We can travel
farther on less fuel. Let me guess. I already gave you these specs.
TUCKER: A week ago, but your upgrades are working nicely. Well, I
should get back to Engineering. See you both later. (Tucker leaves.)
ARCHER: I imagine that must happen often. Maybe these daily briefings
aren’t such a good idea. Looks like it’s just a waste of your time, and
Trip’s.
T'POL: I disagree. We both rely on your experience. You can still
contribute to the success of this mission.
ARCHER: I’m sure you have work to do. I’ll be in my quarters.
T'POL: In the corridor, when the anomaly hit, I urged you to leave me
behind. If you had, it’s likely I’d be the one suffering from this
condition.
ARCHER: Fortunately, I don’t take orders from you.
T'POL: Captain, I never expressed my gratitude for what you did.
ARCHER: I suppose there’s not much point in thanking me. A few hours
from now I won’t remember.
 [Corridor]
HOSHI
[OC]: Bridge to T’Pol.
T'POL: Go ahead.
HOSHI [OC]: We’re receiving a haul through the subspace buoy. It’s
Starfleet.
T'POL: I’m on my way.
T'POL [OC]: This was not a conversation I was looking forward to.
 [Archer
and T'Pol's home]
 T'POL:
It was Admiral Forrest. The Command Council had reviewed the Doctor’s
report on your condition. They relieved you of duty and granted me a
field commission.
ARCHER: Forrest made you Captain. I suppose congratulations are in
order, even if they are belated. I guess these parasites weren’t so
easy to remove after all.
T'POL: Phlox discovered that the organisms are from a domain outside
normal space-time. They exist in a state of interspatial flux. None of
his treatments had any effect on them.
ARCHER: What about the mission? Did you find the Xindi weapon?
T'POL: After several months of searching, we learned where the weapon
was being constructed, but the Xindi knew we were getting close. They
dispatched two vessels to intercept us.
[Bridge]
(Two
reptilian ships are attacking Enterprise. Travis is injured - or dead)
REED: That last one took out warp engines.
HOSHI: They’re locking on to the starboard docking port.
T'POL: Send security teams.
(The Reptilians are looking for Archer. One finds his quarters and
kills his guard then goes in, but Archer puts up a good fight and
eventually stabs him through the chest with a statuette.)
HOSHI: I’m reading twenty three intruders on decks C, D and E.
T'POL: Have your men set up a defence perimeter on B deck.
REED: We’ve lost weapons.
T'POL: Is their ship still docked with us?
REED: It is.
(T'Pol steers Enterprise so that the docked ship smashes into the other
Xindi vessel and breaks up. The starboard nacelle is damaged too.)
REED: Both ships are disabled.
 [Situation
room]
PHLOX:
We’ve lost thirteen of the crew, twenty two injured, several critical.
T'POL: The Xindi?
REED: We’ve taken nine prisoners but the Brig was only designed for
two. I’m not sure what to do with the others.
TUCKER: Blow them out the airlock.
T'POL: Put them in crew quarter’s under heavy guard. How are the
repairs coming?
TUCKER: We should have hull plating and torpedoes in the next couple of
hours. The warp drive's another question. The starboard nacelle’s a
lost cause, half the coils have been fused.
T'POL: How long to repair them?
TUCKER: If we were at Jupiter station, three weeks. Out here I’d have
to rebuild the coil assembly from scratch. Six months minimum. For now
the best I can give you is a warp one point seven.
REED: We’re not going to get very far at that speed.
T'POL: Resume our previous heading. Dismissed. (The others leave.)
TUCKER: How can we keep going with one warp engine?
T'POL: There’s no option.
TUCKER: What the world where you thinking when you rammed that ship?
T'POL: I chose the logical course of action.
TUCKER: Since the Captain got sick, this mission’s taken one wrong turn
after another.
T'POL: If you believe I’ve acted improperly, I suggest you contact
Admiral Forrest.
 [Archer
and T'Pol's home]
ARCHER:
You said we eventually found the weapon. How could we manage that
without warp engines?
T'POL: We located the facility where the Xindi constructed the probe,
but it had already been deployed.
ARCHER: Earth?
T'POL: Destroyed. They didn’t stop at your homeworld. They attacked
every human outpost they could find. Mars, Alpha Centauri, Vega colony,
all were destroyed.
ARCHER: How many of us are left?
T'POL: Less than six thousand.
 [Outside]
 (A
small village of curved roofed metal houses.)
T'POL: We’re on the fifth planet in the Ceti Alpha system. It’s far
from the Expanse.
ARCHER: What happened to the crew?
T'POL: Most of them are still aboard the ship. It’s in orbit,
patrolling this system.
ARCHER: How did all these people get here?
T'POL: Survivors from human colonies realised they needed a place to
take refuge.
Several convoys headed for this system. One of them was lead by
Enterprise.
 [Bridge]
REED:
There’s a ship approaching at high warp. It’s Vulcan.
HOSHI: They’re hailing us.
T'POL: Ambassador.
SOVAL [on viewscreen]: I need to speak with you, T’Pol.
 [Ready
room]
T'POL:
Come in
SOVAL: That uniform doesn’t suit you, Captain.
T'POL: I doubt you travelled all this way to criticise my attire.
SOVAL: I want you to return with me to Vulcan.
T'POL: I'm no longer under your authority.
SOVAL: It’s not an order, it’s a request for your own safety. Two weeks
ago, the High Command received a distress call from the Earth convoy in
the Mutara system. By the time our ships reached them, they found
nothing but a field of debris. The weapon signatures were Xindi. Even
if your ships do manage to reach Ceti Alpha, it’s most likely you’ll
find an armada waiting for you.
T'POL: We’re prepared to confront them.
SOVAL: It was a mistake ordering you to leave Enterprise. It forced you
to make an impulsive decision. If you return with me now, the High
Command is prepared to reinstate your rank.
T'POL: I won’t leave them.
SOVAL: Them or him? There are specialists on Vulcan that can help
Archer.
T'POL: You’d take him as well?
SOVAL: If you return to Vulcan. You owe the humans nothing. They chose
to leave Earth before they were ready. If they’d accepted our counsel,
this tragedy would have been avoided.
T'POL: We could have saved them.
SOVAL: How?
T'POL: We held back their warp programme for one hundred years. A
policy which you supported. If we would have helped them develop faster
ships, better defences.
SOVAL: Your emotional attachment to Archer is clouding your logic.
We’ll be within range for another thirty hours, should you reconsider.
 [Archer's
quarters]
ARCHER:
Come in. Did things go well with the Vulcans?
T'POL: How did you know that they were?
ARCHER: There was obviously a reason I chose these quarters. You can
see a lot from this window. What did they want?
T'POL: They were here to replenish our supplies.
ARCHER: Ha. I’ve been thinking about everything you told me. I realise
I’m not fit to command the ship, but there’s got to be some way I can
help. I could give Trip a hand in Engineering.
T'POL: We tried something similar to that a few months ago. It was
uncomfortable for you.
ARCHER: So I’m supposed to stay locked up in my quarters all day?
T'POL: You often take Porthos for a walk, visit the classrooms on D
deck. The children enjoy hearing about our earlier missions.
ARCHER: In other words, just stay out of the way.
T'POL [OC]: After nearly a year, we arrived in this system. Our convey
was the only one to reach it. The others had all been attacked and
destroyed.
[Ready
room]
TUCKER:
This planet's barely Minshara-class. Maybe we should’ve picked one with
a little more blue and green on it.
I’d like to head down with a survey team and start scouting for colony
sites.
T'POL: You're needed on Enterprise. The civilian leaders are going to
want to meet with you.
TUCKER: Me? You’re the one they deal with.
T'POL: I’m resigning my commission.
TUCKER: You’re sure you want to do this?
T'POL: Captain Archer will be better off on the surface with the
others. He’ll need a caretaker, someone he trusts. I can’t be in two
places at the same time.
TUCKER: You’re making one hell of a sacrifice. Why?
T'POL: I have my reasons.
[Archer
and T'Pol's home]
T'POL:
The civilian ships were disassembled for their components and raw
materials. We used them to construct the settlement. At this point, you
often wonder if you’re a victim of some elaborate deception.
ARCHER: The thought did cross my mind.
T'POL: Margaret Mullin. You met her when you were twenty four years
old, during flight school in San Francisco. The night before you
graduated, you asked her to marry you, outside of her apartment on
Westgate Avenue. She turned you down. She said she didn’t want to
become a Starfleet widow.
ARCHER: How the hell did you know that?
T'POL: Our relationship has evolved over the years.
ARCHER: Exactly how far has it evolved? (Later, Phlox has arrived. His hair is longer, but that's all.)PHLOX: Nothing seems to have changed
since your last exam.
ARCHER: Is this why you came all the way from Denobula, to give me a
check-up?
PHLOX: You didn’t tell him? After this settlement was established, it
became clear that I was never going to find a treatment for your
condition if I remained here, so I returned home and consulted with
some of the finest neurosurgeons and quantum theorists on Denobula. My
colleagues believed there was no way to destroy these parasites short
of vaporising you in a subspace implosion. They assured me the
technology to do what was required did not exist, and they were
correct. It took almost a decade to develop, but now I’m ready to put
it to the test. The procedure requires tremendous amounts of energy,
levels that can only be produced in the reactor of a warp powered
starship.
T'POL: We’re going to Enterprise.
 [Docking
hatch]
 (They
are piped on board in traditional Naval fashion. Tucker has gone grey, too.)
TUCKER: It’s good to see you sir.
ARCHER: Captain Tucker. I don’t think you need to call me sir anymore.
TUCKER: Old habits. I apologise for the low lighting. We’re running on
reserve power. Antimatter’s at a premium these days.
ARCHER: How long has it been since you took command?
TUCKER: Nine years. I’ve got some people who’d like to say hello. (Reed has grown a beard.)
REED: You're looking well, sir.
ARCHER: Thank you, Commander is it?
REED: Actually, I’ve been promoted to Captain.
TUCKER: Malcolm’s taking over the Intrepid from Ramirez.
ARCHER: Did everyone get their own ship while I was gone?
HOSHI: Not everyone, sir.
ARCHER: Hoshi. (They hug.)
TUCKER: There’s a reception in the Mess hall if you’re feeling up to it.
PHLOX: A visit to Engineering may be in order first.
[Engineering]
PHLOX:
I’ll be using a highly focused antiproton beam to eradicate the
parasites. We’ll start with this cluster today.
ARCHER: Why not remove all of them at once?
PHLOX: This procedure’s never been attempted before. We should move
cautiously.
T'POL: When can you begin?
PHLOX: The emitters should be calibrated within the hour.
[Archer's
quarters]
ARCHER:
Come in.
T'POL: You left the reception early.
ARCHER: It was a little disturbing. From my perspective, I saw most of
those people just a few hours ago. It couldn’t have been easy for you,
telling me the same story over and over again for twelve years.
T'POL: I don’t always tell it in detail.
ARCHER: I hope I’ve told you before, but, I’m very grateful for
everything you’ve done for me. If this works
PHLOX [OC]: Phlox to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead
PHLOX [OC]: We’re ready.
 [Bridge]
REED:
I’m picking up an intermittent duranium signature.
TUCKER: Is it a ship?
REED: I’m not certain. It’s in a close orbit around the sun.
TUCKER: We’ve better check it out. Lay in a course.
 [Engineering]
 (Archer
is lying in a perspex tube, with a couple of green lights flashing
above his forehead.)
PHLOX: Increase to eight hundred millicochranes. (The engineer at the
warp controls presses buttons.) PHLOX: Increase to eight fifty.
(A bunch of parasites vanish from the monitor, and they help Archer up.)
 [Bridge]
REED:
There’s a small vessel just outside the chromosphere.
TUCKER: Is it Xindi?
REED: The hull configuration doesn’t match. There’s one biosign on
board.
TUCKER: Open up a channel. This is Captain Charles Tucker. Is there
something we can help you with?
HOSHI: He’s moving.
TUCKER: Follow him.
REED: His warp coils are charging.
TUCKER: Target one of his nacelles. (Three shots later, the little ship
is disabled.) TUCKER: Bring it into the Launch bay.
 [Sickbay]
PHLOX:
Just as my simulations predicted. There’s no trace of the parasites I
targeted. Well, I understand I may have a passenger on my voyage home.
T'POL: I’m remaining at the settlement for the time being. He may need
my help during his recovery.
PHLOX: Have you told the Captain how you feel about him?
It’s obvious you’ve become quite attached. It’s nothing to be ashamed
of. Vulcan’s experience the same emotions as any other species. They’re
simply better at hiding them.
T'POL: I’m not hiding anything. He risked his life to save me. I’m
merely repaying a debt.
PHLOX: I can only imagine what it must have been like. Spending all
those years in that house, learning so much about him, yet he remembers
nothing about you beyond the day he became ill. If we’re successful,
perhaps things will be different.
T'POL: There’s a discrepancy in these scans.
PHLOX: What is it?
 [Brig]
YEDRIN:
(a Yridian) I deal in Rigelian flamegems. I was waiting for a
prospective buyer when you attacked me.
TUCKER: You picked an odd place for a business transaction.
REED: We searched your ship. We didn’t find any cargo.
YEDRIN: That’s because I jettisoned it all. I thought you where going
to arrest me. Flamegems are illegal in this region.
REED: We found your species in our Vulcan database. It appears Yridians
are information dealers.
TUCKER: Who hired you? Was it the Xindi?
YEDRIN: Xindi?
TUCKER: Maybe we didn’t give his vessel a close enough look. Go back to
the launch bay, use a plasma torch and slice that ship into neat little
pieces. Keep at it until you find some evidence that supports his
story.
YEDRIN: You’re going to destroy my ship? It’s not you they want. It’s
the Denobulan.
REED: Phlox?
YEDRIN: I was hired to follow him.
TUCKER: Hired by who?
YEDRIN: I don’t know, they work through intermediaries. I was paid to
follow the Denobulan if he ever left his home world.
TUCKER: What did you tell them? Answer me.
 [Sickbay]
TUCKER:
What’s the problem?
PHLOX: Your engineers won’t let us continue with the Captain’s
treatment.
TUCKER: Those are my orders. Look, I’d do anything to help the Captain,
but we’ve got bigger problems at the moment.
PHLOX: This maybe the only solution to your problems, Captain.
T'POL: Destroying these parasites is most likely the key to saving
humanity, and Earth.
TUCKER: Earth’s gone.
PHLOX: This image was taken a few minutes ago. You can see the region
where I eradicated the first cluster of parasites. It’s gone in this
image, as well.
TUCKER: Doc.
PHLOX: This scan was taken over twelve years ago. The cluster has
disappeared from all the scans I’ve taken over the last twelve years.
It's as if it never existed at all
T'POL: By destroying the organisms in the present, we appear to have
neutralised them in the past.
PHLOX: We know they’re from another spatial domain. Apparently, they
also exist outside of time. If we can eliminate all of the parasites,
it’s possible the Captain’s infection will never have occurred.
T'POL: History may be altered. Captain Archer will have remained in
command of Enterprise. Our mission in the Expanse could have an
entirely different outcome.
PHLOX: We only have to divert power for a few hours. I am certain I can
complete the procedure in that time.
TUCKER: I’m sorry. We need all the power we’ve got for the weapons.
T'POL: If the Xindi are on their way there’s very little we can do to
stop them..
TUCKER: Well, we can’t just run up the white flag.
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Captain Tucker. You'd better get up here, sir.
TUCKER: I’m on my way. We'll talk about this later.
 [Bridge]
HOSHI:
I'm getting a signal from one of our sentry probes. Six Xindi ships
have entered the system.
TUCKER: Charge the phase cannons. Is everyone in position?
HOSHI: Aye, sir.
REED: The Xindi ships are in range.
TUCKER: Fire!
REED: Our shields are holding. Nice to know they work in combat.
TUCKER: Remind me to send a note to General Shran. Adjust your heading.
Three one oh mark two seven. Full impulse.
HOSHI: Two of their ships are breaking off. They’re following us.
TUCKER: What about the others?
HOSHI: Still heading towards the planet.
(As Enterprise leads the two ships off, two more appear at the rear and
attack the intruders.)
REED: The Insectoid ship's been damaged. They’re losing power.
TUCKER: Target the second one.
REED: Their engine's disabled.
HOSHI: The other Xindi ships have changed their heading.
TUCKER: I think we’re going to find out how much of a beating these new
shields can take.
 [Sickbay]
ARCHER:
T’Pol, what’s happening?
T'POL: Jonathan, you need to rest. Where are you going?
ARCHER: To the Bridge. I’m not going to just lie here while they
destroy what’s left of humanity.
T’POL: (to Phlox) You should remain here.
 [Bridge]
(Enterprise is taking a beating.)
REED: Forward shielding’s at fifty two percent.
[Corridor]
ARCHER:
Turbolifts are down.
(He and T'Pol use the Jefferies tubes.)
 [Bridge]
HOSHI:
Intrepid’s taken a direct hit. They’ve lost their port nacelle.
TUCKER: Tell them to withdraw.
REED: Our phase cannons are down. Our forward shield's collapsing!
HOSHI: Hull breaches on B deck, C deck!
REED: They’re targeting the Bridge!
TUCKER: Hard to port!
(The top of the ship is blown off.)
[Corridor]
(They
come out of the tube to a status panel.)
ARCHER: The Bridge is gone.
T'POL: T’Pol to Phlox.
PHLOX [OC]: Go ahead.
T'POL: Meet us in Engineering. We’re going to finish the procedure.
PHLOX [OC]: Understood.
ARCHER: We don’t have time to worry about parasites right now.
T'POL: That’s not necessarily true. Come with me. I'll explain.
(Meanwhile, Xindi reptilians are beaming aboard and massacring the
crew.)
 [Engineering]
PHLOX:
I’m sorry, Captain. The chamber’s been damaged.
ARCHER: Didn’t you say that we could destroy the parasites with a
subspace implosion?
T'POL: Yes, but then we
ARCHER: Can we create one?
T'POL: We would have to overload three plasma injectors. That would
send a feedback pulse through the reactor.
PHLOX: You'll destroy the ship?
ARCHER: At this point, it won’t make much of a difference. You two get
to a shuttlepod. They’re only after humans. If this doesn’t work out
you’ll still have a chance. That’s an order. (T'Pol joins him at the controls.)
T'POL: With all due respect, you were
relieved of command.
ARCHER: One of the plasma injectors was damaged. We'll have to replace
it. They’re in supply locker C on the upper level. (Phlox goes to get
it while MACOs try to hold off the reptilians.) ARCHER: We’re back in business.
(Xindi get into Engineering. Phlox kills one but the other gets him and
he falls from the upper level.) ARCHER: Phlox! Phlox? (Archer returns
fire.) ARCHER: How much longer?
T'POL: Stand by.
(She's also hit, but Archer enters the code before he gets shot as
well. He pushes the final lever with his dying breath and the ship
explodes very spectacularly.)
[Sickbay]
PHLOX:
How do you feel?
ARCHER: Like a shuttlepod landed on my head. What’s our status?
T'POL: We’ve cleared the anomalies. There is minor damage to the
starboard nacelle. Repairs should be complete within an hour.
PHLOX: You suffered a mild concussion. I’d like to keep you overnight
for observation.
ARCHER: All right, Doctor. (Phlox leaves them.)
T'POL: You could have been seriously injured. I told you to leave me
behind.
ARCHER: Fortunately, I don’t take orders from you.
T'POL: I believe you wanted to see this.
ARCHER: Rosemary’s Baby?
T'POL: You were obviously looking forward to it, and since you’re not
going to be able to attend tonight.
ARCHER: Thanks. Would you mind bringing me another pillow? (She does.)
ARCHER: Would you turn down the lights just a little?
T'POL: Anything else?
ARCHER: You know, you’d make a wonderful nurse.

Star
Original Airdate: 12 Nov, 2003
  [Main Street - night]
 (In a
archetypal Western frontier town, four men on horseback ride down the
street to a tree. One has a noose put around his neck.)
BENNINGS: Any last words?
(The other end of the rope goes over a bough, and the knot slides round
to the back of the man's neck.)
SKAG: Go to hell.
BENNINGS: I didn't know Skags believed in hell. (He fires his pistol to
spook the horse and the Skag is left kicking alone in the air.)
 [Main
Street - day]
 (The
dead Skag is coffined.)
MACCREADY: Who's paying for the box? (The undertaker looks towards the lady
schoolteacher.) MACCREADY: I hope you're not planning to bury him in the cemetery.
BETHANY: His people don't bury their dead, but I wouldn't expect you to
know that.
MACCREADY: I'm sorry I didn't get there in time to stop them.
BETHANY: What difference would it have made?
MACCREADY: He'd have gotten a trial.
BETHANY: And the same people who lynched him would have been sitting on
the jury.
MACCREADY: Bethany, he killed a man. Self-defence or not, that's a
hanging offence for a Skag.
(As Bethany walks down the street, a familiar man walks over to a woman
wearing a scarf to cover the tips of her ears.)
ARCHER: What have you got?
T'POL: I've confirmed that they're human. Their DNA is a perfect match.
TUCKER: Looks pretty authentic, Captain, right down to the spittoons.
ARCHER: And the hangings. If these people are from Earth, how the hell
did they get here? (He goes down an alleyway.) ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise. Report.
REED [OC]: We've scanned ninety percent of the surface.
 [Command
centre]
 REED:
The human settlements are clustered within a few hundred kilometres of
your location. About six thousand people.
ARCHER [OC]: And the aliens?
REED: Fewer than a thousand.
 [Main
Street]
 REED
[OC]: Their closest encampment is ten kilometres north west of your
present position.
ARCHER: Any signs of technology, energy signatures
 [Command
centre]
 ARCHER
[OC]: Vessels?
REED: None, sir. Our quantum scans put the earliest structures at over
two hundred and fifty years old.
 [Main
Street]
 TUCKER:
That sounds about right.
REED [OC]: But they're all constructed of materials indigenous to the
planet.
ARCHER: Acknowledged. I want you to go check out that alien settlement.
See what you can find. There's no telling how anyone would react if
they find out who we really are. Keep a low profile.
TUCKER: Aye, sir. (Tucker and T'Pol leave.)
 [Livery
stables]
 TUCKER:
Morning.
STABLEHAND: Can I help you folks?
TUCKER: I hope so. We need a horse.
STABLEHAND: What happened to yours?
TUCKER: Excuse me?
STABLEHAND: It's a long way from the next town. How'd you get here?
T'POL: Our horses perished several miles north of your town from heat
exhaustion.
STABLEHAND: Well, you're lucky the sun vipers didn't get you, or those
Skags. (He gets a horse out of its stall.) STABLEHAND: Come on. This one here, four
years old, good stock. Twenty dollars, she's yours.
TUCKER: Sounds kind of steep. Don't suppose you'd be interested in a
trade?
STABLEHAND: Well, that depends what you've got to trade. (Tucker gets
out an harmonica and plays it.) STABLEHANDL Haven't seen one of these in years.
TUCKER: Look, I know it's not worth the horse, but we only need him for
a couple of hours. We just want to ride out and grab our gear. We'll be
back before you know it. Well, how about I leave my gun for collateral.
STABLEHAND: You got yourself a deal, buddy.
(Tucker leads the horse out while the stablehand plays the harmonica.
He mounts, and offers his hand to T'Pol.)
T'POL: Do you have any experience riding these animals?
TUCKER: I've seen every John Ford western.
T'POL: Who?
TUCKER: How hard can it be? (T'Pol swings up behind him.) TUCKER: Better hold on.
(He finally persuades the horse to walk on, very slowly.)
 [Saloon]
 ARCHER:
Afternoon.
BARTENDER: What can I get you?
ARCHER: I'm passing through town. I was hoping I could sit in here for
a while till it cools down.
BARTENDER: Coffee's on the house.
ARCHER: Thanks.
BARTENDER: Where're you headed?
ARCHER: My brother's got a ranch down south. He said he could set me up
with some work.
BARTENDER: What's he raising, bluehorns?
ARCHER: How'd you know?
BARTENDER: Land down there's not good for much else. (Archer takes the
hot coffee and looks at the portrait over the bar.) BARTENDER: See the resemblance?
ARCHER: Yeah. Yeah, I do. You're not telling me you're related to
Cooper Smith? (Archer reads the name plaque under the painting.)
BARTENDER: He's my ancestor.
ARCHER: I'll be damned.
BARTENDER: Yep. You're looking at the only direct descendant of the man
who overthrew the Skags.
ARCHER: I'll bet you've got some stories.
BARTENDER: Got a few I could tell you. (Three men enter.)
ARCHER: Friends of yours?
BARTENDER: Not particularly.
BENNINGS: How about a little service?
BARTENDER: What'll it be?
BENNINGS: Anything but that rot-gut you were pouring yesterday. (The
boy takes bottle and glasses to the table.) BENNINGS: Why don't you join us?
DRAYSIK: (a Skag, by the markings near his ears) You know I'm not
allowed to do that, Mister Bennings.
BENNINGS: It's Deputy Bennings, and I can bend a local ordnance if I
choose. Have a seat. (he sits) I imagine you could use a drink, after
what happened last night. Let's raise a glass to the dearly departed.
To dead Skags. (Bennings drinks from the bottle.) BENNINGS: Drink up. (Draysik takes a sip
and coughs.) BENNINGS: I thought you people could hold your liquor. Your friend
had a few in him the night he killed Clay Stanton.
DRAYSIK: He didn't drink.
BENNINGS: Beg your pardon?
DRAYSIK: I'd better get back to work.
BENNINGS: Oh, no, wait a minute. I don't think I heard you right.
You're telling me that a sober Skag had the nerve to shoot a man? I
find that hard to believe. Maybe you could demonstrate. (Bennings cocks his
pistol and puts it on table, grip towards the boy.) BENNINGS: Pick it up, shoot me
right here between the eyes. This is your golden opportunity, don't
pass it up. (The tables behind him clear rapidly.) BENNINGS: I know you'd like to kill
me. That's what all you Skags want, isn't it? Go ahead, or maybe you
need to finish that drink first.
ARCHER: Excuse me. Can I get some more coffee before you shoot him?
(Draysik takes the cup and scuttles away, grateful.)
BENNINGS: Who the hell are you?
ARCHER: Name's Archer.
BENNINGS: Well, Mister Archer, you could learn a thing or two about
manners. (Bennings picks his gun up again.) ARCHER: I don't like being interrupted in the
middle of a conversation.
ARCHER: I'll keep that in mind.
MACCREADY: Is there a problem here?
BENNINGS: I was just having a drink with our friend Draysik and this
gentleman decided to butt in.
MACCREADY: I saw you this morning at the undertakers. What's your
business here?
ARCHER: Just passing through town.
MACCREADY: This Skag a friend of yours?
ARCHER: I just wanted him to get me a cup of coffee.
MACCREADY: It's a little hot for coffee, don't you think?
ARCHER: Maybe you're right. (to Bennings) It's been a pleasure.
(Archer leaves.)
MACCREADY: Keep an eye on him. Make sure he leaves town. And Bennings,
leave the Skag alone.
 [Skagaran
settlement]
 T'POL:
I'd estimate this vessel has been here for at least two centuries.
TUCKER: Where are you going?
T'POL: The Captain said to learn whatever we could.
TUCKER: He also said to keep a low profile.
T'POL: I plan to.
 [Schoolhouse]
 (The
schoolteacher is tidying up when the door opens)
ARCHER: Didn't mean to startle you.
BETHANY: What do you want?
ARCHER: My name's Jonathan Archer. I saw you this morning, paying for
that man's casket.
BETHANY: I don't know where you're from, Mister Archer, but around here
no one refers to a Skagaran as a man. If you'll excuse me.
ARCHER: Can I help you with that?
BETHANY: I'll manage.
ARCHER: It's no trouble.
BETHANY: I'll ask you again. What do you want?
ARCHER: I'd like to learn more about the Skagarans.
BETHANY: Everyone knows about the Skagarans.
ARCHER: There aren't any where I come from.
BETHANY: Where's that?
ARCHER: Up north, quite a ways.
BETHANY: If certain people had their ways there wouldn't be any around
here either. I heard about what you did in the saloon today. Deputy
Bennings has a nasty temper. Why would your risk getting thrown in
jail, maybe worse?
ARCHER: I don't think that Skagaran's life is any less valuable than
mine.
BETHANY: So, what do you want with me?
ARCHER: Well, you are the teacher around here, aren't you? The first
Skagaran I ever saw was today, lying in that coffin. Seems I'd be more
likely to get the truth from you than from the men who put him there.
BETHANY: Would you like to meet more of them?
(She picks up her bag and turns out the oil lamp. They leave town in
her two horse buggy, watched by Bennings and his henchmen.)
 [Skagaran
settlement]
BETHANY: It's all right.
(Archer takes a look at the wreckage of the spaceship that the
settlement is built in.)
T'POL: Captain?
ARCHER: Bethany, these are the friends I told you about.
BETHANY: You're from up north too?
T'POL: That's correct.
BETHANY: The children will be here soon. You said you wanted to learn
something, Mister Archer. You're welcome to stay for the lesson.
ARCHER: Thanks.
TUCKER: Kinda late at night to be teaching school.
BETHANY: It's illegal to teach Skagarans.
(She leaves the trio alone.)
ARCHER: A ship?
TUCKER: What's left of it. (T'Pol shows Archer some crystals.)
T'POL: We found these in a data module.
ARCHER: Go back to Enterprise, see what you can salvage.
TUCKER: You're not coming with us?
ARCHER: Don't want to miss my first day at school. (Later -)
BETHANY: Nine times twelve, don't forget to carry the one. Yral?
YRAL: (a boy) Nine times twelve equals one hundred and eight.
BETHANY: That's right. You're doing very well with your multiplication
tables. Tomorrow night we'll start with something a little more
challenging. Long division. Kret, collect the slates, please. I've
brought a friend with me who'd like to learn more about your people.
Who can tell Mister Archer how the humans and the Skagarans came to
live together? Taliyah?
TALIYAH: (a girl) Our ancestors took the humans from their planet and
brought them here.
BETHANY: And why did they do that?
TALIYAH: To make them work.
BETHANY: But the humans didn't want to work for the Skagarans, did
they.
BENNINGS: No, we didn't.
BETHANY: (to the children) Go on home now. Go on, it's all right. (The children
flee.)
BENNINGS: I tried to warn you, Bethany. Teaching Skags is a crime. You
know that.
BETHANY: Nobody's being hurt here.
BENNINGS: So you say, but I'm afraid the law is the law.
ARCHER: I thought you could bend the local ordnances.
BENNINGS: That's true, but this is one I have no intention of bending. (His two henchmen take hold of Bethany.)
BETHANY: Get away from me.
(Archer grabs the henchman, there's a struggle, Bennings floors Archer.)
BENNINGS: Sheriff gave you a chance to leave town. You should have
taken it.
(Bethany and Archer are hauled away.)
 [Sheriff's
Office]
(There's a noise outside, and the deputy on duty goes to investigate.)
DEPUTY [OC]: Get away from there. Go on, now. (Bethany tends Archer's injuries.)
BETHANY: Best I can do.
ARCHER: Thanks. What's going to happen to you know.
BETHANY: Don't worry. This isn't the first time the Sheriff and I
haven't seen eye to eye.
ARCHER: You didn't get to finish your lesson. I'd like to hear the rest
of it.
BETHANY: You know the story. Everyone does.
ARCHER: Everyone seems to have their own version. I'm curious to hear
the way you teach it to the Skagarans. That wreck at their settlement,
was that their ship?
BETHANY: They used it three hundred years ago to go to Earth and bring
our ancestors back here. They were building colonies, they needed
workers.
ARCHER: You mean slaves.
BETHANY: It was a terrible crime.
ARCHER: Tell me about Cooper Smith.
BETHANY: That's where the stories differ somewhat. To the humans he's a
folk hero, our liberator. I'm sure that's what you were taught. But the
Skagarans, they call him rakh'tar. It means butcher. He and his men
burned the Skagaran ship, destroyed their weapons. They murdered most
of them. Entire families. Have you heard that version? Smith wrote the
first laws that kept the Skagarans from going to school, owning
property, even marrying.
ARCHER: So they could never enslave the humans again.
BETHANY: That's how they justified it. Men like Bennings are happy to
carry on the tradition. (Bennings opens the cell door.)
BENNINGS: Sheriff wants to talk to you.
 [Barber
shop]
 (The
Sheriff is having his stubble carefully removed by cut-throat razor.)
MACCREADY: Care for a shave, Mister Archer?
ARCHER: No thanks.
MACCREADY: You sure? There ain't nothing like a barber shave to make a
man feel civilised.
ARCHER: I feel civilised enough.
MACCREADY: Suit yourself. Thanks Henry.
BARBER: Any time, Sheriff. (The barber leaves them.)
MACCREADY: Have a seat. Skagaran whisky. It's illegal, but I've let
Henry keep a bottle around for pulling teeth. (He pours two shots.) MACCREADY: Packs a
hell of a wallop. (he drinks) I thought you were heading south to raise
bluehorns.
ARCHER: That's the plan.
MACCREADY: Then maybe you can tell me why you were out in Skagtown in
the middle of the night.
ARCHER: That a crime?
MACCREADY: My deputy says you and Miss Bethany were teaching those
children. That's a crime.
ARCHER: But if I decided to lynch a Skagaran, that'd be legal?
MACCREADY: The law was laid down a long time ago to protect men like
you and me.
ARCHER: Protect us from what? Children?
MACCREADY: You really want those children to learn how to read, how to
do their numbers, and then maybe they can learn about how they used to
be in charge around here. How they had guns that could kill a man with
a beam of light, and the human beings were nothing but their labour
force, their property. Is that what you want those children to learn,
Mister Archer?
ARCHER: You're judging them on something that happened over two hundred
years ago.
MACCREADY: And it's my job to make sure it never happens again. Now,
I'm not saying it's fair. It's just the way it's always been. I expect
you to be out of town in an hour.
ARCHER: What's going to happen to Bethany?
MACCREADY: She's been warned. She knew the consequences. Minimum
sentence is ten years.
 [Main
Street]
 ARCHER:
Archer to Enterprise.
TUCKER [OC]: Go ahead
 [Command
centre]
 TUCKER:
Captain.
ARCHER [OC}: Any luck with those data modules?
T'POL: Several of them were damaged, but we managed to access some of
the logs.
HOSHI: I'm still working on the translation, sir.
ARCHER: I'll meet you at the landing coordinates in an hour.
 [Main
Street]
 ARCHER:
There's something I have to do first.
 [Sheriff's
Office]
(Bennings is gazing lustfully at Bethany in the cell when there's a
knock on the door.)
ARCHER: I was on my way out of town and realised I forgot something.
(He punches Bennings out cold, takes the keys and his gun, and opens the
cell door.)
BETHANY: What are you doing?
ARCHER: It's called a jail break where I come from.
BETHANY: It's called that here, too. Where do you expect me to go? (Archer drags Bennings inside the cell.)
ARCHER: There are other
settlements. I'm sure they could use a good teacher.
BETHANY: Things won't be any different there.
ARCHER: Maybe not, but you won't be spending ten years in prison.
(He locks Bennings in the cell. Later, the sheriff has returned.)BENNINGS: It was Archer.
(MacCready lets him out and they go into the street, weapons drawn.)
 [Main
Street]
MACCREADY: They couldn't have gotten far. Get Nash and Franklin.
(As Archer and Bethany make a dash for it in her buggy, Bennings shoots
her and she falls to the ground. Archer goes back for her. MacCready
stares in disbelief at what has just happened.)
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise. Lock the transporter onto my position.
There are two of us.
BENNINGS: Drop that, whatever it is.
(The pair disappear, and he is furious.)
 [Sickbay]
(Bethany is on the operating table and Phlox is working.)
T'POL: Did anyone see you transport?
ARCHER: I didn't exactly have time to find a secluded spot.
T'POL: These are volatile and suspicious people. Your disappearance may
have consequences.
PHLOX: I've removed the projectile, but her injuries were extensive.
ARCHER: Will she make it?
PHLOX: I believe so. There are a few things about her physiology I
still don't understand.
ARCHER: What do you mean?
PHLOX: Aren't you familiar with this woman's ancestry? The cranial
genes are recessive, which explains her human appearance. My guess is
they came from her maternal grandmother. She's one quarter Skagaran.
 [Sheriff's
Office]
BENNINGS: You heard the story same as me. Cooper Smith said the Skags
could move through thin air from one place to another.
MACCREADY: Maybe you ought to get your eyes checked, Bennings. Archer's
a human.
BENNINGS: He's working with them.
MACCREADY: You don't know that.
BENNINGS: What was he doing out in Skagtown? Why'd he stick up for
Draysik in the saloon yesterday?
MACCREADY: 'Cause you were being a horse's ass.
BENNINGS: And who was he talking to on that little box he had? It was
the Skags. They helped him escape. This is what we were afraid of, Mac.
They'd try to take over again. It's time to put an end to this.
MACCREADY: You have something in mind?
BENNINGS: I say we ride out there tonight and burn 'em out. I guarantee
there'll be plenty of volunteers.
MACCREADY: Now you listen to me. I'm not going to murder those people
just because some stranger spooked you with a parlour trick. Now if I
get some proof that the Skagarans are up to something, I'll take care
of it.
BENNINGS: You've always been too soft on them, Mac.
MACCREADY: And you've always harassed them while I've looked the other
way, and that's going to change right now. As long as you work for me,
our job is to enforce the law. Understood?
BENNINGS: Understood. (Bennings takes off his badge and drops it on the floor.)
 [Control
centre]
 HOSHI:
The story she told you was basically true, Captain. The Skagaran ship
brought them here to provide labour for a colony they were trying to
establish.
T'POL: They apparently found the humans suited to survive in this
environment.
HOSHI: There are a lot of reports of disciplinary problems, and then
six months after they arrived, the logs end.
ARCHER: (back in uniform) They kidnapped the wrong people.
TUCKER: So what do we do? They're humans. We can't just leave them here.
TRAVIS: We can't transport six thousand people back to Earth.
ARCHER: Once we've dealt with the Xindi we'll come back here. Do what
we can to help them. For now, they deserve to know that Earth hasn't
abandoned them.
 [Main
Street]
 (The
locals watch a shuttlepod come in and land. MacCready has his hand on
his gun as Archer, T'Pol, Reed and three MACOs get out.)
ARCHER: We need to talk.
 [Sheriff's
Office]
MACCREADY: And you were born there?
ARCHER: I was born in up-state New York. Spent most of my adult life in
San Francisco, though. You've heard of San Francisco?
MACCREADY: Pacific coast. Why didn't you tell us who you were?
ARCHER: I wasn't sure how you'd react. We thought we'd better get the
lay of the land first.
MACCREADY: Well, I can't say I blame you. A part of me never believed
Earth even existed. I thought it was something people made up because
they couldn't stand living here. You taking us back?
ARCHER: We can't, not right now. Anyway, our ship isn't big enough.
Someday we'll come back for you. You, you realise it's not the same
world your ancestor's left. A lot's changed in three hundred years.
MACCREADY: You're telling me.
ARCHER: We've moved past things like intolerance, prejudice.
MACCREADY: The Skagarans abducted my ancestors, Captain. Turned them
into slaves.
ARCHER: That was a long time ago.
MACCREADY: Well, we tend to have a long memory when it comes to that
sort of thing.
 [Main
Street]
 REED:
The Captain's been in there quite a while.
T'POL: I imagine the Sheriff has a lot of questions.
REED: Yeah.
 [Sheriff's
Office]
MACCREADY: We did what we had to do.
ARCHER: I understand, but if you do make it back to Earth you're going
to have to leave all that behind.
 [Main
Street]
(Finally Archer and MacCready come out, and walk through the little
crowd that has gathered near the pod.)
MACCREADY: It's all right. These folks aren't going to hurt anybody.
ARCHER: This is my First Officer, T'Pol. She's from a planet called
Vulcan.
T'POL: Pleased to meet you.
MACCREADY: Ma'am.
T'POL: Doctor Phlox reports that his patient is doing much better.
ARCHER: Good. I thought we'd bring Mister MacCready (There is a gunshot.
MacCready is hit, and the crowd scatters.)
BENNINGS: Have your men drop those guns.
ARCHER: Let's talk this through, Bennings.
BENNINGS: I never was one for talking.
(His men take up crossfire positions as Reed and the MACOs take up
defensive ones, but Archer stays firm.)
ARCHER: Trust me, you don't want to pick a fight with us, Deputy.
BENNINGS: Should have thought of that when you threw in with the Skags.
ARCHER: We're not taking sides here.
BENNINGS: Then where'd you get that machine and those weapons?
MACCREADY: These people are from Earth, Bennings.
BENNINGS: Earth? You're lying.
ARCHER: I can prove it to you. Just give me a chance.
(Reed stuns a sniper in a window, who rolls gently down the roof to the
ground, and the shooting starts. Archer and T'Pol get MacCready to
safety behind the shuttlepod while Reed takes his position behind the
water trough. Cole uses her better rifle sights to take out another
sniper while the Starfleet phasers hit nothing.)
ARCHER: Lay down some fire. (He makes a dash towards Bennings, taking
out one henchman the ordinary way and another by cutting into the
balcony he was standing on. Then he gets hit in the right shoulder.
Bennings follows Archer into the livery stables where they have a fist
fight while the MACOs finish off more of the opposition. A cowboy holds T'Pol as a shield.)
COWBOY: Stay back. I'll kill her. (Reed
stuns T'Pol  and the cowboy drops her, astonished. Then he gets stunned
too. )
REED: (to Cole) Secure the area. (to Woods) Find the Captain.
(The fight in the livery stable crashes into an occupied stall, and
between the unhappy horses legs. Bennings grabs a bale hook and starts
swinging it. He gets it stuck in the timber and Archer finally takes
him down.)
 [Briefing
room]
(Bethany is gazing out of the large window.)
ARCHER: We're up too high to see it but your town is down there,
towards the right edge of that mountain range. How are you feeling?
BETHANY: I feel fine. Not even a scar.
ARCHER: Doctor Phlox does excellent work.
BETHANY: You must think we're barbaric. All the things humanity's
accomplished, building ships like this, travelling to other world, and
we're still down there shooting each other.
ARCHER: The progress on Earth, it didn't happen overnight.
BETHANY: But it was progress all the same. You've managed to change, we
haven't. Even if you could take us back, I don't think we're ready.
ARCHER: It may be a while before we're able to start sending ships
here. My guess is, by the time they arrive they'll find things have
changed.
BETHANY: I think you're giving us too much credit.
ARCHER: It's happening already. I spoke with MacCready. He agrees that,
in light of recent events some of your laws might be a little outdated.
 [School
room]
 (Bethany is
teaching a mixed class of human and Skagaran children for the first
time, and she has a PADD in her hands. MacCready is standing in the
doorway.)
BETHANY: Before people could travel through space to other planets,
they had to get off the ground first. Almost forty years after my human
ancestors left Earth, two brothers from Ohio became the first human
beings to build a successful flying machine. Their names were Orville
and Wilbur Wright. Would anyone like to see a picture of their
airplane? You all would. Well, here it is, right here, and you can see
here's Orville Wright, and his brother Wilbur is flying the plane. Now
this is the machine that actually made

  [Armoury]
 (The
whole crew is present, with the senior crew together on the upper
level, as Archer gives a speech.)
ARCHER: The most difficult task facing any Captain, any crew, is the
loss of a shipmate. We've come here to honour one of our own. In the
time we knew him, he showed us just how much one life can truly matter.
We will never forget what he did for us, and for the ship he loved so
much. We will go forward with renewed determination to complete this
mission, so that his sacrifice won't just have been for the people on
this ship, but for all the citizens of Earth.
(And the person laid out in the torpedo case is - Charles 'Trip' Tucker!)
 Two
Weeks Earlier
 [T'Pol's
quarters]
 (Tucker and T'Pol
are lying on their sides, massaging each other's heels.)
TUCKER: We just reroute the system taps, compress the antimatter stream
before it reaches the injectors.
T'POL: That will stabilise the warp field?
TUCKER: Every simulation I run comes back with the same result. We'll
be able to cruise at warp five point oh with no field fluctuation. I'm
talking about a ride so smooth you could build a house of cards on the
warp reactor.
T'POL: If we can maintain high warp for extended periods, we can cover
the Expanse more quickly.
TUCKER: Which boosts our chances of finding the Xindi weapon in time. (T'Pol winces as he presses the wrong bit of her foot.)
T'POL: To the left.
TUCKER: Oh, sorry. You get me talking about the engines and I forget
where I am. Don't know what it is about fine-tuning a piece of
machinery.
T'POL: Lie on your back.
(She kneels by his head.)
TUCKER: You know, you made this sound a whole lot worse than it is.
T'POL: Advanced neuro-pressure can place great demands on the body.
TUCKER: Well, I have to say that so far, it's a piece of cake.
T'POL: We haven't gotten to the more challenging postures.
(She leans over him to press his ribcage.)
TUCKER: Well, I'm always up for a challenge.
T'POL: Breathe.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER:
Tucker to the Bridge.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Archer.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER:
We're all set down here.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER
[OC]: I'll need at least four point nine
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER:
To get the plasma hot enough to compress the stream.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
You heard the man, Travis. Four point nine.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir. Four point five, four point six, four point seven,
four point eight. (The ship vibrates.)
T'POL: The warp field is fluctuating.
TRAVIS: Four point nine.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER:
Initialising stream compression. (A fat red line turns to thin white
one on the monitor.) TUCKER: Damn, that's a beautiful sound.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
Field fluctuations have dropped to zero.
ARCHER: We just got our second wind.
(There's a big bump and people lose their footings. Alarms go off and
the fat red line is back and fatter.)
T'POL: Something's flooding the intake manifolds.
ARCHER: Drop to impulse.
TRAVIS: I've lost helm control.
ARCHER: Trip, status.
TUCKER [OC]: I've got a primary injector flare.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER:
I'm shutting down. It's not responding, Captain.
(Things go bang and there are flames around as Tucker climbs on top of
the reactor.)
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
The flare is causing a system-wide overload.
(There are flames next to her station too.)
(In Engineering, Tucker manually shuts the engines down, but something
explodes, throwing him from the top of the engines to the floor where
he hits his head hard. Enterprise falls out of warp in a purple fog.)
REED: Fires reported on B and C deck. Emergency crews en route.
TRAVIS: Helm control is still down.
ARCHER: Analysis.
T'POL: Some kind of polaric field, approximately eleven thousand
kilometres in diameter. Composition unknown. I'll need more time to
complete a detailed scan.
ARCHER: Is that what stopped us?
T'POL: It's a logical conclusion.
ARCHER: Keep scanning.
HOSHI: Numerous injuries throughout the ship. Mostly minor, except for
one. Commander Tucker. He's been taken to Sickbay.
 [Deleted
scene - Bridge]
REED: The nucleonic particles are being drawn to the hull.
ARCHER: Polarise the hull plating.
REED: I already tried that, sir. No effect.
ARCHER: Then purge the intake manifolds and shut all the exhaust ports.
PHLOX [OC]: Phlox to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
PHLOX [OC]: Would you come down to Sickbay?
ARCHER: On my way. Run a full sensor scan. I want to know what we're
dealing with.
REED: Aye, sir.
 [Engineering]
 (T'Pol
is supervising the mending of a big hole in a bulkhead.)
ARCHER: Report.
T'POL: When we entered the field nucleonic particles flooded the
manifolds, causing the injector flare. If Commander Tucker hadn't shut
down the reactor, we could have had a breach.
ARCHER: How much time before we can get the engines back online?
T'POL: We're still running diagnostics. The damage is significant. It
could take weeks. Commander Tucker's going to have his hands full.
ARCHER: You'll be supervising the repairs. I've just come from Sickbay.
Trip's in a coma. He has extensive neural damage. Doctor Phlox says we
have to prepare for the possibility that Trip won't survive.
 [Sickbay]
 (Tucker
has his head bandaged, monitor devices on his forehead and an oxygen
tube under his nose.)
ARCHER: How is he?
PHLOX: His condition's unchanged. I'd like to show you something. This
is one of the more interesting members of my little menagerie, a
Lyssarrian Desert Larvae. It's epidermal layers secrete a viral
suppressant that I use as a salve for cuts and bruises.
ARCHER: How does this relate to Trip?
PHLOX: The larvae have another, somewhat more controversial, property.
When implanted with the DNA from another species it exactly replicates
that species' life-cycle, albeit at a rapidly accelerated rate.
ARCHER: It becomes a clone.
PHLOX: Essentially, but one that is born, grows old and dies in
approximately fifteen days. The Lyssarrians call them mimetic simbiots.
They're a closely guarded secret. Very few people know of their
existence.
ARCHER: And you want to do this with Trip. Use his DNA to grow a
simbiot.
PHLOX: To harvest it's neural tissue for transplant. There's no
guarantee that human DNA will stimulate the larvae's growth cycle, but
as it stands now it may be Commander Tucker's only hope for survival.
To ensure the tissue's compatibility, I'll have to wait until the
simbiot reaches Commander Tucker's present physical age, then I can
excise the tissue from a non-critical region of the simbiot's cerebral
region. It would experience no discernable side effects and should be
able to live out it's normal life span.
ARCHER: It's fifteen day life span.
PHLOX: I don't make this proposal lightly, Captain, but I'm obligated
to provide you with all available options.
 [Ready
room]
 ARCHER:
Come in.
T'POL: We sent out an EV team. They retrieved a sample of the substance
accumulating on the hull. Multiple hits with a plasma rifle were
required to dislodge it. It's composed of highly charged particles,
mostly ferric ions, but there are several elements that we can't
identify. (the sample leaps to Archer's mug and sticks there) And it's
highly magnetic. So far, the danger to the ship seems negligible.
ARCHER: But the longer we remain in the field, the more these particles
build up. Do whatever you have to do, but we need to get those engines
back online.
T'POL: Understood. Regarding the Lyssarrian procedure Doctor Phlox
proposed, may I ask if you've reached a decision?
ARCHER: I approved it.
T'POL: Are you aware that the Lyssarrian Prime Conclave has banned the
creation of simbiots?
ARCHER: We don't answer to the Lyssarrian Prime Conclave.
T'POL: Simbiots are living, conscious entities. We'll be growing a
sentient being for the sole purpose of harvesting tissue.
ARCHER: I'm aware of the ethical implications. If we weren't in the
Expanse maybe my decision would be different, but we've got to complete
this mission. Earth needs Enterprise, Enterprise needs Trip. It's as
simple as that.
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. The engines are still down and the
nucleonic particles continue to build up on the hull. It's been two
days since Doctor Phlox initiated the procedure to grow the simbiot.
 [Sickbay]
 (The
lights are dim as Phlox leads Archer to a large tub with an embryo
floating in it.)
PHLOX: It's rather sensitive to light at this stage. By tomorrow
morning, if all goes well, we'll have a healthy baby boy on our hands.(Next day, a new-born is exercising his lungs in the traditional manner.)
PHLOX: Perfect genetic duplicate, right down to the birthmark on his
right side.
T'POL: He certainly sounds healthy.
PHLOX: And hungry. Excuse me. (Phlox hands her the bottle so he can pick the
child up.) PHLOX: There, there. Oh, it's been some time since I've had a
new-born, but I see I haven't lost my touch. (The baby suckles happily.)
ARCHER: Three days ago he was just another one of your creatures,
something you kept on a shelf.
PHLOX: He's certainly come a long way in a short time.
T'POL: In a short time he'll be a lot older. Have you thought of where
he's going to live?
PHLOX: Why not right here? I can't think of a more stimulating
environment for a developing young mind, and I'd be able to keep a
close watch on his development.
ARCHER: Sounds like you've found yourself a new roommate.
PHLOX: Now all I need to do is find him a name. The crew's been
offering suggestions but nothing sounds right. Steven, Enrique, Dennis.
Dennis? You see my dilemma?
ARCHER: I'm sure you'll think of something. (Later -)PHLOX
[OC]: Chief Medical Officer's log. After much deliberation I have
finally thought of a name for this newest addition to our crew. PHLOX:
It's all right, Sim. It's all right.
PHLOX [OC}: Lucky for me Denobulans require little sleep. I'm at a loss
as to how human adults endure the REM cycle interruptions that
accompany the teething stage. Though I knew what to expect, I can't
help but be astonished by Sim's rapid physical development. A side
note, I may have stumbled across an effective fertiliser for my Orsic
fern. (Phlox
and Hoshi are sitting on the floor, listening to a young boy reading
from a book.)
SIM: Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine
the strange horror of it's a - app - appearance.
HOSHI: That's very good.
SIM: Can we just skip to the part where the Martian machines attack?
HOSHI: We just showed you this book. How do you know about the Martian
machines?
SIM: My mum read it to me.
HOSHI: Your mum?
SIM: Uh huh. I think it's chapter ten.
PHLOX [OC]: It's become quite evident that Sim's remarkable scholastic
progress goes far beyond an aptitude for learning.
 [Mess
hall]
 (The
boy is a pre-teenager.)
PHLOX: He's remembering things that happened to Trip when Trip was this
age.
ARCHER: So the older he grows, the more of Trip's life he'll recall?
PHLOX: There are some species that rely solely on genetic sequencing to
pass on their cultural memories. Evidently, humans have a similar
capacity. This could be an important discovery. He certainly possesses
Commander Tucker's curiosity. This morning he took apart my medical
tricorder.
ARCHER: He's starting to look like Trip.
PHLOX: And he's beginning to ask questions. Where did I come from?
Where's my mother and father? Why am I here?
ARCHER: It's only been three days and he's already beginning to realise
how different he is.
PHLOX: He's going to have to be told the truth, soon.
ARCHER: I gave the order that created him. I should be the one to
explain why.
 [Deleted
scene - corridor]
(Porthos comes skittering around a corner, followed by Sim.)
ARCHER: Whoa! Where do you think you're off to?
SIM: I was trying to teach him to fetch.
ARCHER: Now, don't take it personally. Fetching isn't his style.
PHLOX: (slightly out of breath) I'm sorry, Captain. I was in the middle
of giving Porthos his physical. I only turned my back for a moment.
ARCHER: (holding Porthos): It's all right. Is he okay?
PHLOX: Yes, indeed. He's in peak physical condition. Which is more than
I can say for myself.
ARCHER: It's almost time for his dinner. (to Sim) Do you want to help
me feed him?
SIM: Sure.
ARCHER: (hands the little dog over to the lad) Come on.
 [Archer's
quarters]
 (Archer comes
in with Porthos's bowl and opening a pouch of food.)
ARCHER: There's nothing Porthos likes more than dinnertime.
SIM: Can he do any tricks?
ARCHER: I haven't taught him any. Mostly what he does is eat, sleep,
and not fetch. Just fill it up half way.
SIM: Okay. I used to have a dog. His name was Bedford. He was so big, I
could ride him like a horse.
ARCHER: Is that right. (Sim spots a picture on the shelf.)
SIM: That's Zephram Cochrane. He
invented warp drive.
ARCHER: That's right, he did.
SIM: Doctor Phlox says your dad helped design the warp five engine.
ARCHER: That's a picture of him right there, and this is me on my first
day of flight school.
SIM: Did you always want to be a starship captain?
ARCHER: As long as I can remember.
SIM: Why?
ARCHER: It's what I was meant to do.
SIM: Bet it's a fun job.
ARCHER: It has its moments. Let me show you something.
 [Cargo
bay]
 ARCHER:
Keep the nose up. That's right. (Sim is flying a remote control plane.)
SIM: It pulls a little to the left.
ARCHER: Trim the port aileron.
SIM: That feels better. My dad says I should be an engineer. My mum
thinks I should study architecture, but I want to do what you do, be a
starship captain. You know what's weird?
ARCHER: What?
SIM: My parents call me Trip, but everyone here calls me Sim. Where's
my mum and dad? Are they back on Earth?
ARCHER: That's a little difficult to answer. (Sim is distracted and the
model plane crash lands.)
SIM: It's broken.
ARCHER: Nothing a little glue won't remedy. I crashed it plenty of
times myself.
SIM: I miss my parents.
ARCHER: Come with me.
 [Sickbay]
 SIM:
Doctor Phlox says I'm not allowed to go in there.
ARCHER: It's okay. (Phlox pulls back the curtains around Trip's bed.)
SIM: He's Trip.
ARCHER: That's right.
SIM: My parents. They're not really mine, they're his.
ARCHER: Yes.
SIM: So, that time I put a garden snake in Lizzie's dollhouse, that
wasn't me.
ARCHER: No.
SIM: So I'm just some kind of copy of him.
ARCHER: You're more than that, Sim. You have Trip's memories, but you
also have your own memories, the ones you're making here on Enterprise.
SIM: How long have I lived here?
ARCHER: You were born only four days ago.
SIM: I feel older.
ARCHER: It's hard to understand, I know. There's part of you, something
inside you, that Trip needs. Doctor Phlox is going to have to perform
an operation.
SIM: Will it hurt?
PHLOX: Not at all. You won't feel a thing.
SIM: Doctor's always say that.
ARCHER: When Phlox says it, it's the truth.
SIM: Can we go fix the model now?
ARCHER: Sure.
Captain's log, supplemental. Enterprise has been incapacitated for
seven days. During that time Sim has practically become a member of the
crew. I've assigned him to Engineering where he's been assisting T'Pol
in the on-going effort to repair the engines.
 [Engineering]
(Sim is now a young man.)  SIM:
Wave guides for the primary port bypass. Think I've
made some progress.
T'POL: This looks promising.
SIM: They're showing 'A Night At The Opera' tonight. Marx Brothers.
Wondered if you're planning to go.
T'POL: I'll be reviewing the field coil equations. They need to be
finished in time for tomorrow's reactor test.
SIM: Oh. What about dinner? Want to grab a bite?
T'POL: I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid I have to work late into
the evening. Ensign Massaro is running a diagnostic on the plasma
assembly. I'd like you to assist her.
SIM: Yes, ma'am. It's because I'm different, isn't it? The reason you
don't want to do anything with me. I guess it must be weird, being with
someone like me. Five days ago I was wearing diapers.
T'POL: I simply believe that our attention should be focused on the
ship's engines, at least until the current situation is resolved.
SIM: I probably won't be around after the current situation's resolved.
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to T'Pol.
T'POL: Go ahead.
ARCHER: Would you please come to my Ready room.
T'POL: On my way.
 [Ready
room]
 T'POL:
Warp drive should be functional in two weeks.
ARCHER: I'm afraid that won't be soon enough.
T'POL: Sir, I
ARCHER: According to Malcolm, the accumulation on the hull is generating
a diamagnetic field. It's having a dampening effect. The more the
particulate builds up, the more powerful the field becomes. In another
four days every system on the ship will be offline. If we don't make it
out of here by then, we never will.
 [Mess
hall]
 REED:
Key Lime pie. (Sim is a full grown Tucker.)
SIM: I suddenly realised it was my favourite dessert.
Now I know why.
REED: Do these memories just come to you?
SIM: The older I get, the more I remember. It's like I've lived this
whole other life. Can't explain it.
REED: I can't imagine it. You wanted to ask me about something.
SIM: Yeah, I did. Do you think it's possible to redirect the phase
cannons so they can fire back onto the hull?
REED: I suppose so. Why?
SIM: I want to try and blast off enough of that particulate so we can
open up the Launch Bay doors.
REED: Is someone planning on going somewhere?
SIM: All we need to do is build up enough momentum to can get the ship
out of here, right?
REED: Right.
SIM: Well, we've got two perfectly good engines sitting in the Launch
Bay. If we string a couple of grappler lines between the shuttlepods
and the ship we can tow ourselves clear.
REED: The shuttlepods don't generate that kind of thrust. We'd never
build up enough momentum to get clear of the field in time.
SIM: Leave that to me. (He hands over a PADD.)
 [T'Pol's
quarters]
 SIM:
Can I come in? Did you have a chance to look at my calculations?
T'POL: I reviewed them thoroughly.
SIM: And?
T'POL: A fusion overburn has never been attempted with a shuttlepod
engine.
SIM: That doesn't mean it won't work.
T'POL: I agree. Despite the risks, I believe it's our best option.
SIM: So you're going to recommend the plan to the Captain?
T'POL: I already have. Was there something else?
SIM: You and Trip used to spend a lot of time here together.
T'POL: I was instructing him in the practice of Vulcan neuro-pressure.
SIM: I remember. We were lying right there, working the neural nodes on
each other's feet, talking about the warp engines. How I was hoping to
modify them.
T'POL: How Commander Tucker was hoping to modify them.
SIM: Right. Commander Tucker. You know, he was really starting to enjoy
those sessions with you.
T'POL: They were helping him sleep.
SIM: I'm not sure that's the only reason.
T'POL: What do you mean?
SIM: Was there ever anything between you and Trip?
T'POL: If you're referring to a romantic relationship, no.
SIM: The reason I ask is, well, you're all I think about, if you know
what I mean. And I'm not talking about an adolescent crush. That was,
well, that was two days ago. This is much more serious, the way I feel
about you. Anyway, what's driving me crazy is, I don't know if these
feelings are mine or his.
T'POL: I can't answer that.
SIM: I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.
T'POL: I'm not uncomfortable.
SIM: I just thought I should tell you this, while I still had the
chance.
 [Ready
room]
ARCHER: Come in.
SIM: I want to pilot one of the shuttlepods.
ARCHER: That's out of the question.
SIM: It's my plan. I think I should have a say in how it's implemented.
ARCHER: This is a dangerous procedure. You've never flown a shuttlepod
before.
SIM: Yes, I have. Trip has thousands of hours of flying time and I have
his memories.
ARCHER: I can't jeopardise this ship on the strength of those memories.
Mayweather and Reed will pilot the shuttlepods. I want you to
co-ordinate from the Bridge. T'Pol will assist you.
SIM: You're worried something'll happen to me, aren't you. You want to
make sure I'm around because you need part of my brain.
ARCHER: Yeah, that's part of it.
SIM: So your concern for my safety is really about saving Trip.
ARCHER: My main concern is that this plan work. If we don't make it out
of here in the next six hours it won't matter if Trip survives or not.
We'll all be dead.
 [Bridge]
(Sim is at Reed's station.)  SIM:
I've realigned the targeting scanners. They're set
for close proximity.
T'POL: Phase cannons are charged and ready. (They fire.)
ARCHER: Try the doors.
T'POL: They're still frozen. (Another shot and they open.)
ARCHER: Archer to shuttlepods one and two.
 [Shuttlepod
One]
 ARCHER
{OC}: You are clear to launch.
REED: Acknowledged.
 [Shuttlepod
Two]
 TRAVIS:
Shuttlepod two. Acknowledged. (Off they go and put grapples onto the
main hull.)
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Whenever you're ready.
SIM: Set the overrun ratio. We'll start at oh point one seven five.
 [Shuttlepod
One]
 REED:
Acknowledged.
 [Shuttlepod
Two]
MAYWEATHER: Oh point one seven five.
 [Bridge]
 SIM:
Prepare to initiate on my mark. Now.
 [Shuttlepod
One]
 REED:
One thousand kilodynes.
 [Shuttlepod
Two]
 TRAVIS:
Thrust vector holding steady.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Come on.
 [Shuttlepod
One]
 REED:
Two thousand kilodynes. Engine temperature's rising.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
I'm reading zero forward momentum.
REED [OC]: Two thousand five hundred kilodynes.
 [Shuttlepod
One]
 REED:
Engine temperature's nearing critical.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
We're still not moving.
ARCHER: Come on. SIM: Increase the overburn ratio another
 [Shuttlepod
One]
 SIM
[OC]: Thirty percent.
REED: Captain?
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
Go ahead.
 [Shuttlepod
One]
 REED:
Increasing thirty percent.
 [Shuttlepod
Two]
 TRAVIS:
I've got a temperature warning light.
 [Shuttlepod
One]
 REED:
I'm reading five hundred degrees above critical. (Things start to go
bang in both shuttlepods.)
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
Their systems are overloading.
ARCHER: Sim.
SIM: A few more seconds.
T'POL: They won't last a few seconds.
ARCHER: Sorry, Sim. Archer to the shuttlepods. (The ship judders.)
T'POL: We're moving. Point six two kilometres per hour.
 [Shuttlepod
Two]
 TRAVIS:
Twelve kilometres per hour and accelerating.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
How much do we need?
T'POL: At this speed we'll emerge from the field in six point one
hours.
ARCHER: That's good enough. Archer to shuttlepods one and two. Come on
home. (to Sim) Well done.
SIM: Thanks Captain.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER:
You wanted to see me?
PHLOX: There's been a development.
ARCHER: I'm listening.
PHLOX: Sim won't survive the transplant.
ARCHER: You told me you could remove the tissue without harming him.
PHLOX: That assessment was based on simbiots grown from Lyssarrian DNA.
My tests on Sim show that human based simbiots are not as resilient. If
I excise the quantity of neural tissue I need to save Commander Tucker,
Sim will die. I'm sorry, Captain.
 [Deleted
scene - Engineering]
T'POL: Your shift ended ninety minutes ago.
SIM: Just want to get these initiators in place.
T'POL: You've been working for eighteen straight hours.
SIM: If you had five days left, would you spend them sleeping? Besides,
tomorrow morning I'm walking into Sickbay to donate some of my unneeded
neural tissue. Which means that pretty soon I'll be answering to the
real Trip, and if I know him, he's going to want these engines in as
good a shape as they can be.
T'POL: I haven't commended you on the successful implementation of your
plan. You saved the ship.
SIM: I appreciate that.
T'POL: (noticing monitor display) Lyssarrian Desert Larva.
SIM: I wanted to learn something about my own species, so I've been
doing a little research. Mostly on lifespans. Did you know that at one
time in history human beings lived an average of only thirty five
years? The average Vulcan lifespan was only forty?
T'POL: Your point?
SIM: Just that both species expend a lot of effort to change those
statistics. I guess it's just natural for people to want to stick
around for as long as possible.
 [Sickbay]
 SIM:
Why not give up my life? I've only got five, six days left anyway.
ARCHER: That isn't how we see it.
SIM: Let me ask you something, Doc. When you researched Lyssarrian
larvae did you come across any references to the Velandran Circe?
PHLOX: They were a group of Lyssarrian scientists who conducted illegal
experiments on simbiots. They claimed to have developed an enzyme that
stopped the rapid aging process.
ARCHER: Is there any truth to it?
SIM: Why do you think he kept it a secret?
ARCHER: Doctor?
PHLOX: The enzyme is experimental, with very little empirical evidence
to suggest that it works. That's why I didn't mention it.
SIM: There's not much evidence, but it exists. The fact is, I may not
have to grow old and die in a week. There's a chance that I can live
out a normal lifespan. I can't change what happened to him but maybe I
can change what's going to happen to me.
 [Trip's
quarters]
 SIM:
Come in.
ARCHER: How long have you been staying here?
SIM: I was on the way to my room last night, but I came here instead.
ARCHER: These are Trip's quarters.
SIM: Which is where I belong. I have his memories, I have his feelings,
I have his body. How am I not Trip?
ARCHER: Commander Tucker is lying in Sickbay.
SIM: Then what am I? Just something you grew in a lab? Does that make
it easier for you to condemn me to death?
ARCHER: If you refuse to go through with this you'll be condemning Trip
to death.
SIM: I didn't put him in a coma.
ARCHER: No, but you can save him.
SIM: In a way I will, by saving myself.
ARCHER: Phlox says there's almost no chance that the enzyme will work.
SIM: My life is at stake! Any chance is worth taking.
ARCHER: But at what cost? It'll take a day to synthesise the enzyme. By
that time your neural tissue won't be compatible with Trip's anymore.
He'll die.
SIM: I know.
ARCHER: I can't let that happen.
SIM: So what are you going to do? Drag me down to Sickbay, force me
onto a biobed at gunpoint?
ARCHER: If you truly have all of Trip's memories, you know the answer
to that. I don't have to tell you what's at stake. I must complete this
mission, and to do that I need Trip. Trip! I'll take whatever step's
necessary to save him.
SIM: Even if it means killing me.
ARCHER: Even if it means killing you.
SIM: You're not a murderer.
ARCHER: Don't make me one.
 [Engineering]
 SIM: I
was wondering if there's anything I can still do. Maybe there's a panel
I can install or something. I've got a few hours to kill before my
operation.
T'POL: You wish to spend your last hours in Engineering?
SIM: Why not? The two things I care most about are in this room.
T'POL: If you'd like, the A3 injector port needs replacing.
SIM: I'll get right on it.
(Instead, he goes to a computer screen and starts doing something.)
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER:
What's the problem?
REED: Someone's rerouted the Launch Bay controls. We're shut out.
ARCHER: Archer to the Launch Bay. Come in.
HOSHI: Captain, I'm reading one person in there.
 [Launch
bay]
(Sim is sitting in the hatch of Pod One.)  SIM:
I was all ready to do it.
ARCHER: What stopped you?
SIM: Where the hell was I going to go? We're nowhere near any habitable
planet. Didn't really want to spend the rest of my life floating around
in a shuttlepod which doesn't even have any toilet facilities. Can you
imagine a lousier way to spend your old age? Cooped up in that thing,
peeing in a bottle? Actually, I can imagine a worse fate.
ARCHER: What would that be?
SIM: Being stuck in there with Malcolm. Damn, this is a screwed up
situation.
ARCHER: I can't argue with you there.
SIM: A lifetime in eight days. It's not that I'm scared of dying, it's
just that I can't imagine not being here tomorrow. You want to know
what really stopped me?
ARCHER: What?
SIM: My sister. And she was my sister as much as Trip's.
ARCHER: I believe that.
SIM: I don't want what happened to her to happen to anyone else.
ARCHER: That's why I gave the order to create you.
SIM: Do me a favour when this is over. If Commander Tucker decides to
do any more modifications to the engines, tell him to watch his ass.
 [Tucker's
quarters]
(Sim is stroking Porthos when the intercom beeps.)  SIM:
Yes.
PHLOX [OC]: We're ready for you.
SIM: On my way.
T'POL: May I come in? I just wanted to say how much your absence will
affect the crew. How much it will affect me.
SIM: I appreciate that. All in all, I guess I've had a pretty good
life. (T'Pol kisses him.) SIM: I couldn't have asked for a better going away
present.
 [Sickbay]
 SIM:
I'm sorry I doubted you, Doc.
PHLOX: No need to apologise.
SIM: I'm serious. You see, I don't just remember Trip's childhood, I
remember mine. You made a damn good father.
PHLOX: You were a damn good son.
SIM: You said to me once that commanding a starship was what you meant
to do. I guess this is what I was meant to do. Good luck, Captain.
ARCHER: Thanks. (Sim goes into Tucker's cubicle.)
SIM: You owe me one. (Sim returns to lie on the
biobed. Phlox injects him and his eyes close.)
 [Armoury]
 ARCHER:
We will never forget what he did for us, and for the ship he loved so
much. We will go forward with renewed determination to complete this
mission, so that his sacrifice won't just have been for the people on
this ship, but for all the citizens of Earth.
(During the speech, the camera continues its pan around from the
torpedo casing to Malcolm, Hoshi and Tucker. Malcolm and Travis put the lid on the casket and torpedo case 2744506 is
shot out into space.)

The Enterprise Transcripts - Carpenter Street
Carpenter
Street
Original Airdate: 26 Nov, 2003
  (On a rainy night in Detroit, 2004,, a car pulls
up and a man gets out, carrying a folder. He crosses the street and
goes into an apartment block. Up in his room, he bolts and chains the
door and gets a beer from the fridge. There's the remains of an old
pizza in the bathroom. He takes a bite. The telephone rings.)
 [Loomis'
apartment]
 LOOMIS:
Hello?
DAMRON [OC]: Have you made your selection?
LOOMIS: Yeah, yeah, it's all set, just like we discussed.
DAMRON [OC]: We'll be expecting you.
LOOMIS: And the money, same as last time, right?
 [Warehouse]
 DAMRON:
The same. Be careful with the sedative. You nearly killed the last one.
LOOMIS [OC]: One hundred milligrams. Don't worry, I'll get it right.
DAMRON: We'll be expecting you.
(Finally we see the speaker is - a Xindi Reptilian.)
 [Street,
night]
 (Loomis
stops his car near a pair of working girls, and one comes over.)
PROSTITUTE: Looking for a date, honey?
LOOMIS: Maybe with your friend.
PROSTITUTE: You don't know what you're missing. (She walks away and the
other comes over.)
GEORGIA: Ooo, what can I do for you, sweetheart? (She holds his hand.)
GEORGIA: Hey, I know you from this morning. You brought me the apple juice.
LOOMIS: What?
GEORGIA: At the clinic?
LOOMIS: Oh, yeah. Now I remember. Small world, huh?
GEORGIA: Want me to get in?
LOOMIS: Sure, yeah.
GEORGIA: Bye, girl. See you tomorrow. [Loomis' car](He drives off.)GEORGIA: There's a nice place to park
right in the neighbourhood. Turn left at the next light.
LOOMIS: Georgia Tandy, O negative.
GEORGIA: How the hell would you remember that? (Loomis pulls in to the
side.) GEORGIA: Er, it's another two blocks. (He gets out a bottle and a cloth.)
GEORGIA: If that's drugs, I am not interested. What you got in there?
LOOMIS: Come here. (There's a brief struggle as he puts the
chloroform-laden cloth over her mouth, then she passes out.) LOOMIS: There you
go. There you go. (Then he injects her with the sedative.) LOOMIS: It's okay.
They said they won't hurt you.
 [Warehouse
entrance]
 (Loomis
presses the intercom.)
DAMRON [OC]: Yes?
LOOMIS: Loomis. (The gates open, he drives in, parks up and carries
Georgia inside.)
 [Warehouse]
 (Inside
the American Wrecking Company building, there are two rows of beds, and
most have occupants. There are medical monitors and other hospital
equipment around.)
LOOMIS: There you go, nice and comfy. (He lays her on bed, attaches an
IV and puts a pair of electrodes on her forehead. Then he collects a
briefcase containing his money and leaves.)
 [Archer's
quarters]
 ARCHER:
(to Porthos) Good boy. Cheese? (Archer throws a piece and Porthos catches it.) ARCHER: This is
your last piece.
DANIELS: It's okay. How've you been, Jon?
ARCHER: About time you showed up. Our mission's changed quite a bit
since the last time I saw you, but I suppose you're aware of it.
DANIELS: I am.
ARCHER: Maybe you could fill in a few of the blanks for me. The Xindi
weapon would be a good place to start.
DANIELS: We don't know any more than you do.
ARCHER: I thought you and your colleagues were supposed to be keeping
an eye on the time line. You're from the thirtieth century. Hasn't all
this happened already?
DANIELS: History doesn't mention anything about a conflict between
humans and Xindi.
ARCHER: How could that be?
DANIELS: The events that are taking place are the result of temporal
incursions. They are not supposed to be happening.
ARCHER: But they are happening.
DANIELS: Yes, they are, but the outcome hasn't reached us yet. It takes
a while for changes to ripple through the time line.
ARCHER: The time traveller, the man the Suliban worked for.
DANIELS: What about him?
ARCHER: He's the one who told us about the weapon being built. Should I
believe him?
DANIELS: You have no reason not to.
ARCHER: You said I'm supposed to play some crucial part in history.
Does this have something to do with it?
DANIELS: I wish I could say that it does, but I don't know. I told you,
none of this was supposed to happen.
ARCHER: You're not being very helpful. Why are you here?
DANIELS: We've detected three Xindi where they're not supposed to be.
ARCHER: This Expanse is filled with Xindi.
DANIELS: I'm not talking about the Expanse. I'm talking about Detroit,
Michigan, a hundred and fifty years ago.
 [T'Pol's
quarters]
 (The
doorbell wakes her.)
ARCHER: Sorry to get you up, but this couldn't wait.
T'POL: Come in.
(Porthos makes himself right at home.)
ARCHER: I just had a visit from Daniels. I think all your doubts about
time travel are about to go out the window.
T'POL: Meaning?
ARCHER: Daniels and his team have discovered three Reptilians on Earth
in the early twenty first century. He wants to send us back to find out
what they're doing.
T'POL: Us?
ARCHER: He told me I could bring one person, no more.
T'POL: If Daniels is the time traveller he claims to be, why doesn't he
find our for himself?
ARCHER: It took him a long while to get permission to interact with me.
There are clearances. He said it would take too much time.
T'POL: I would think he would have all the time in the world.
ARCHER: He said the three Xindi travelled to Earth from our century.
They've been there for two months. They're not sight-seeing, T'Pol. We
have to find out what they're up to.
T'POL: How are we supposed to accomplish this?
ARCHER: He wants us to meet him in the Command Centre at oh eight
hundred tomorrow. (to Porthos) Come on, boy. Check the database. Find
something to wear that won't stand out in 2004.
 [Corridor]
 TUCKER:
Last time Daniels sent you to another century you had one hell of a
time getting back.
ARCHER: He gave me this, said he'd return us whenever we signalled him.
(Archer opens the box to show sixteen little items.) ARCHER: These are temporal tags. We can
use them to bring back anything that doesn't belong there.
TUCKER: If anyone asks where you went, what should I tell them? With
two shuttlepods in the bay it'll be hard to explain.
(T'Pol joins them, her hair covering her ears.)
ARCHER: I'm sure you'll think of something. Try to stay out of trouble.
TUCKER: You too.
ARCHER: Here's the duty roster. (Archer and T'Pol walk into the Command
Centre which is now)
 [Detroit,
street at night]
 T'POL:
We just travelled ninety light years back to Earth.
ARCHER: And a hundred and fifty years into the past.
T'POL: Forgive me if I'm not entirely convinced.
ARCHER: You will be. Come on. (They walk along scanning parked cars at
a row of meters.) ARCHER: This one has a motion activated security system. This
one too. (The third seems a good bet, and he uses the scanner to unlock
it.) ARCHER: We're in.
T'POL: This apparatus. It appears to have been designed to incapacitate
the vehicle.
(The car's been clamped. The next potential one with an open window
has a Rottweiler in it. They finally get into a truck with ladders on
the roof and a loud radio which Archer struggles to switch off)
RADIO: Sunday, the Tri-state Speedway, an all-star line-up of all your
favourite monster mayhem.
 [In
the truck]
 T'POL:
Have you ever operated a vehicle from this period?
ARC HER: I can pilot a starship. R N D 2 3 4.
T'POL: I suggest you begin with two.
ARCHER: Foot controls. (They eventually drive off)
T'POL: I don't believe you've activated your external lighting.
ARCHER: What year is that map from? (T'Pol reads her PADD.)
T'POL: 2002. It was the closest I could find in the
Starfleet database.
ARCHER: The layout shouldn't have changed a lot in two years.
T'POL: Turn starboard on twenty fourth street.
ARCHER: If that thing has a scanning radius of three kilometres, how
far are we going to have to drive to cover the entire city?
T'POL: I have created a search grid that requires a journey of
approximately eighty kilometres, but it's probably we'll find them
before we complete it.
(Later, a light has come on on the dashboard.)
T'POL: What's that icon?
ARCHER: It's a gasoline pump. We need to get fuel.
T'POL: Where?
ARCHER: Where isn't the problem. We're going to need money. US
currency.
T'POL: That's going to be difficult at this time of night.
ARCHER: Not necessarily.
 [Outside
bank]
 (The
scanner persuades an ATM to dispense notes.)
ARCHER: People used to go to jail for this.
T'POL: We'll return what we don't use.
 [Strode's
apartment]
 (Loomis
rings the bell on 602. The door opens slightly and the occupant answers from lower down, from behind the chain.)
STRODE: Yeah?
LOOMIS: Are you Vaughan Strode?
STRODE: Who are you?
LOOMIS: I'm from the blood bank. We had a screw-up this afternoon. We
gave you the wrong papers to sign.
STRODE: I'm not giving the money back.
LOOMIS: No, no, no, they don't want the money back. In fact. they're
going to pay you again. Twenty five bucks. They just need you to sign
the right papers.
STRODE: You bring them?
LOOMIS: No, they wouldn't let me. You've got to do it in front of the
supervisor. You know, the fat broad that paid you. They sent me to
drive you down.
STRODE: It's eleven o'clock at night.
LOOMIS: Yeah, I know. They want to send your blood work out first thing
in the morning and they can't do it without the right paperwork. You
want the twenty five bucks or not? (Strode opens the door and comes out in his wheelchair.)
STRODE: This going to
take long? I don't want to miss Conan.
 [In
the truck]
 T'POL:
Were they aware at this time that Earth's supply of fossil fuel was
nearing depletion?
ARCHER: They had been for thirty years, but it wasn't until 2061 that
they finally (The scanner beeps.)
T'POL: One kilometre, straight ahead. (Archer parka up
very neatly in a near-deserted car park.)
T'POL: Second structure from the left. Three Xindi biosigns.
ARCHER: Any humans?
T'POL: Five, in another part of the building.
ARCHER: This doesn't look very residential. Set your phase pistol to
kill. When the Reptilians boarded Enterprise, stun had no effect. See
what you can find out. I'll look over there.
 [Outside
the warehouse]
 (In different places, talking over their communicators. T'Pol is by the security fence, Archer by the wall.)
T'POL: Go ahead.
ARCHER: There's a neutronic power source coming from the
first floor.
T'POL: I've found a gate with an electric locking mechanism. We
shouldn't have a problem. Do you see the vehicle?(Archer ducks out of line of it's headlights.)
ARCHER: I see it.
DAMRON [OC]: Yes?
LOOMIS: Loomis. (The gate opens. He drives through as T'Pol watches)
 [Inside
the Warehouse]
 (Strode
is now laid out on a bed. Damron is hiding in the shadows.)
DAMRON: Did you disinfect your hands?
LOOMIS: I insert IVs all day, I told you that. If there are any
infections here it won't be because of me. You forget something?
DAMRON: We've decided to compensate you for the final three patients in
one payment.
LOOMIS: Well, that's not what we agreed. You said I'd get paid for each
one.
DAMRON: Bring us the last two blood types and you will be compensated.
LOOMIS: We should wait a while, a few more days at least. There was
something on the news. Cops are starting to get some complaints that
people have gone missing.
DAMRON: We can't wait a few more days. We need the last two.
LOOMIS: Look, as soon as they figure out that all these people here
have been to the clinic, it won't take a rocket scientist to point the
finger at me.
DAMRON: Then I suggest you finish your work quickly.
LOOMIS: Look, I don't know what you guys are up to, and I don't want to
know. It's not my business. But the cops don't take kindly to people
who help terrorists. I gotta be real careful.
DAMRON: We will double your fee for the final three, but the last two
must be here by tomorrow.
LOOMIS: Double? Tomorrow? Yeah, all right. I'll have them here by
tomorrow.
 [In
the truck]
(They're waiting for Loomis to leave.)
ARCHER: Here he comes. (They follow.)
 [Loomis'
apartment]
 (Back
home, Loomis paces a bit, then gets another beer, sits on his bed and
starts going through files.)
LOOMIS: Ninth floor. (rejected) Two hundred and eighty pounds.
(rejected) William Myers, second floor.
(There's a knock on the door, and it's someone he doesn't know.
Archer's scanner tracks him trying to get out down the fire escape and
breaks in. T'Pol is at the bottom of the ladder and floors Loomis with
a neck pinch.  Back in the apartment, Loomis is awake and tied to a chair.)
ARCHER: And the man in the wheelchair. Why were you bringing him to an
abandoned factory in the middle of the night?
LOOMIS: I swear I don't know what you're talking about.
T'POL: What's this? (She shows him the case of Methohexital.)
LOOMIS: Oh, I took that from the clinic. I work at the blood bank on
Porter Street. Check with them, they'll tell you. I've been there for
over a year.
ARCHER: Why would you take it?
LOOMIS: Make a few extra bucks. There's plenty of people on the street
looking for that stuff.
T'POL: Really. Why would anyone on the street be interested in
acquiring methohexitol?
ARCHER: You make it a habit of climbing out your window when someone
knocks on the door?
LOOMIS: I don't like cops.
ARCHER: Tell us about your friends on Carpenter Street.
LOOMIS: I've never been to Carpenter Street.
ARCHER: You were there an hour ago with the man in the wheelchair. Now
tell me who's inside that factory.
LOOMIS: I told you, I don't know what you're talking about. I think
it's time you find me a lawyer.
ARCHER: Untie him.
LOOMIS: You heard him. Untie me. (T'Pol unties him.) LOOMIS: That's better.
(Archer floors him with a massive punch then drags him back onto the
chair to be retied.)
ARCHER: I didn't feel right doing that with you tied up. Carpenter
Street.
LOOMIS: You're not allowed to hit me.
ARCHER: Untie him again.
LOOMIS: No, no, no, no, wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute, I
don't know who he is, I swear to God. A doctor, maybe. Says he's
working on a vaccine, experimental. He doesn't have approval or
something like that so he needed me to bring him people.
T'POL: Does it seem logical to you that legitimate medical research is
being conducted in an abandoned factory?
LOOMIS: I thought about that. Just tonight, I thought maybe he's some
kind of terrorist. But I swear if I knew that for a fact I never would
have agreed to help him.
T'POL: In one individual we've managed to find the worst qualities of
this era. Greed, violence, moral corruption.
LOOMIS: But he said he wasn't going to hurt anybody. I just saw them an
hour ago. They're all okay.
ARCHER: How many?
LOOMIS: Five. No, no, six. The wheelchair guy was number six.
ARCHER: How did this doctor find you.
LOOMIS: I told you, I work at the blood bank. He wanted someone from
every blood type. Eight blood types, eight people. He figured I had
access to that kind of information. (T'Pol hands Archer the files.)
T'POL: Did he also figure that you'd have no
compunctions about abducting people?
ARCHER: What's he paying you?
LOOMIS: Five thousand apiece, double for the last three.
T'POL: Is that what human life is worth in the twenty first century?
LOOMIS: I told you, he said he wasn't going to hurt any of them.
ARCHER: What does he look like?
LOOMIS: He only calls me on the phone. I saw him a couple of times, but
he stays in the shadows. You know, he's kind of tall, that's all I can
tell you. Why don't you let me go. I swear to you, I will never do it
again.
ARCHER: You are going to do it again. That is, if you have any hope of
staying out of prison.
LOOMIS: What are you talking about?
ARCHER: These two files, AB positive and B negative, they're the final
two?
LOOMIS: Yeah.
ARCHER: Well, then you're looking at your next victim, a healthy male
with B negative blood.
 [In
the truck]
(Loomis is sitting between Archer and T'Pol.)  LOOMIS:
If you think you're going to be in
there a long time, we should get something to eat first.
T'POL: Be quiet.
LOOMIS: Come on, I'm not talking about anything fancy. A burger, a
taco? There's a drive-through less than a mile from here. Cops have to
eat, don't they? What is the matter with you two? I'll pay.
T'POL: I told you to be quiet.
ARCHER: What side of the street is it on?
(At the drive-through burger shop.)
WOMAN [OC]: Welcome to Burgerland. How may I serve you, sir?
LOOMIS: I'll have the Double Superbeef, no lettuce.
ARCHER: One Double Superbeef without lettuce, please.
WOMAN [OC]: You can make that a triple for only forty cents extra.
LOOMIS: Do it.
ARCHER: A double will be fine.
WOMAN [OC]: Would you like to make that a combo?
LOOMIS: Yeah, fries and a medium root beer.
WOMAN [OC]: Will there be anything else today?
ARCHER: A hamburger, ketchup only.
WOMAN [OC]: You can make that a double for only forty cents extra.
ARCHER: No, thank you.
WOMAN [OC]: Would you like to make that a combo?
ARCHER: No, no combo.
WOMAN [OC]: Will there be anything else today?
T'POL: Does the Fiesta Salad contain animal products?
WOMAN [OC]: No, but we can add three strips of bacon for only seventy
five cents more.
T'POL: Nothing for me, thank you.
ARCHER: You're sure?
T'POL: Quite.
(Driving along again. Loomis is eating his burger with his hands tied.)
LOOMIS: You guys don't mind, do
you? I'm starving. You know, it'd make it a lot easier if you'd untie
my hands. It's not like I'm going anywhere.
ARCHER: Do the best you can. (A piece of meat falls in T'Pol's lap.)
LOOMIS: Uh oh, I told you. Let
me get that for you. Oh boy. (She pushes him back and throws the piece
out of the window.) LOOMIS: You're a veggie, I forgot. Why don't you take a fry,
they're probably okay. Have it your way.
 [Warehouse}
 (Loomis
wheels an unconscious looking Archer in, puts him on a bed and inserts
the IV into the back of his hand. He whispers as he puts the electrodes on his forehead.)
LOOMIS: They'll
come in to take fresh blood samples every hour. They re-administer the
sedative every six hours. I recommend you do whatever you're going to
do before then.
(The door at the top of the stairs opens.)
LOOMIS: Number seven.
DAMRON: Which one is it?
LOOMIS: B, B negative. You'll have AB positive by tomorrow night, I
swear.
DAMRON: Make certain I do. (Damron closes the door. Loomis takes the wheelchair
and leaves.)
 [In
the truck]
(T'Pol is crouched down holding a phase pistol.)  T'POL:
Engage the engine and proceed to
the second location.
LOOMIS: Nice ray gun. Am I supposed to believe that thing's for real?
(She fires at the driver's door and it makes a hole.)
T'POL: Drive.
LOOMIS: Ten grand a piece for the last three and I'm not going to see a
penny of it.
T'POL: Don't speak until we're out of visual range.
 [Warehouse]
REPTILIAN: (to other Reptilian) Fifteen millilitres from the new
arrival.
(Somehow Archer doesn't flinch as the needle is pushed into his neck
and the blood sample drawn.)
 [Loomis'
car]
 LOOMIS:
You catch these guys and I get immunity, right. We're not talking about
copping to a lesser charge.
T'POL: When my associate returns we'll discuss the details.
LOOMIS: Hey, I'm taking a big chance here, okay? If your associate
doesn't catch them, they're going to come looking for me, okay? You two
have to keep your word.
T'POL: You've been abducting people for money and you're questioning
our honesty?
(On the warehouse, Archer disentangles himself from the wires and IV
and starts following the Reptilians through the building using the
scanner. He has his phase pistol ready.)
T'POL: Sit back.
LOOMIS: Relax, just getting a smoke. (T'Pol stares in horror at him lighting up.)
T'POL: What are you doing?
LOOMIS: I don't know about you, honey, but I'm a little tense. know
what I mean?
T'POL: Extinguish that now!
LOOMIS: If you want some air, open your window. (She holds the phase pistol to his head.)
T'POL: Now.
(He throws the cigarette out of the vehicle. Her communicator chirps and she takes the keys from the ignition.)
T'POL: Stay exactly where you are. (She gets out of the car.) T'POL: T'Pol.
ARCHER [OC]: They brought a bio-reactor with them. They're synthesising
some kind of viral agent.
 [Warehouse
- looking down on the Xindi lab]
 ARCHER:
Rajiin warned us about a bio-weapon. This could be it.
 [Outside
warehouse]
 T'POL:
Why would they travel back through time?
ARCHER [OC]: Daniels said they might be hiding from someone.
 [Warehouse
- looking down on the Xindi lab]
 ARCHER:
The past seems like a pretty good place to hide.
 [Outside
warehouse]
 ARCHER
[OC]: We've got to keep them from getting it back to our time.
T'POL: Are you in a position to disable all three of them?
 [Warehouse
- looking down on the Xindi lab]
 ARCHER:
I don't know. I was thinking about trying to take out the bio-reactor,
but I could end up spreading whatever's in there across half the city.
 [Outside
factory]
 T'POL:
They must have some kind of temporal beacon. If you can destroy it,
they'll have no way of getting back.
 [Warehouse
- looking down on the Xindi lab]
 ARCHER:
I've got to find it first.
 [Outside
warehouse]
 T'POL:
Modify your scanner to a delta band frequency. That should help you
locate the signal from the temporal beacon. (Loomis digs a flick knife
out from the base of the passenger sea.t)
 [Warehouse
- looking down on the Xindi lab]
 (Archer
locates the beacon and fires his phase pistol at it. He also hits a
Xindi and starts a shooting match. The remaining two pull a metal tube
out of the middle of the machine and make a run for it. Archer jumps
down onto the floor of the lab and puts temporal tabs on the
bio-reactor and the fallen Xindi.)
ARCHER: (into communicator) They've gone out the west door. They could
be headed for the street. They have the virus.
 [Outside
factory - west]
 ARCHER:
T'Pol.
T'POL [OC]: Yes, Captain.
ARCHER: They're in the west alley way north of the main
 [Outside
warehouse]
 ARCHER
[OC]: Building. I could use some help.
T'POL: Acknowledged. (She returns to the car and throws the keys at
Loomis.) T'POL: Drive.
 [Loomis'
car]
 LOOMIS:
Trouble?
T'POL: Drive.
(Further on.)
T'POL: Pull over and stop here.
LOOMIS: They give you all that fancy equipment and what good does it do
you.
T'POL: Lower your window.
LOOMIS: (winding it down) I knew your partner's plan wouldn't work.
T'POL: Be quiet. They're coming. (As soon as the building door opens,
Loomis sounds the horn.) T'POL: Stop! (Loomis swings the knife at her but misses.
She fires her phase pistol and hits one Xindi, then disarms Loomis,
adjusts the setting on her phase pistol and stuns him. Archer is in hot
pursuit of the remaining Xindi, who heads up a ladder to the roof. They
both go up another ladder.)
ARCHER: Come on.
 [Warehouse
rooftop]
 (The
Xindi finds an extractor fan and takes the virus out of it's case.
Archer fires at him and he hides.)
ARCHER: He's trying to release the toxin.
T'POL: We've eliminated his only means of returning to his own century.
Perhaps he has no other choice.
ARCHER: If he's trying to destroy humanity, he's not going to be able
to do it with that. They only modified the virus for six blood types.
T'POL: If they can infect three quarters of Earth's population, it's
unlikely humans will pose a threat to them in the future.
ARCHER: Let's hope he can't see in the dark. Keep laying down fire.
(He circles around, jumping across a narrow alley to get behind and
above the Reptilian.)
ARCHER: Don't move a muscle. Drop it. Why a second weapon? Where were
you going to take it?
DAMRON: We won't allow you to destroy us. Your species is doomed.
(Damron lunges for the virus, but is shot. Nevertheless, he pushes the virus
case and it rolls towards the extractor fan. Archer grabs it before it
falls in. T'Pol tags the body.)
ARCHER: Let's go.
 [Corridor]
 TUCKER:
Problem, sir?
ARCHER: It's done.
TUCKER: Sir?
ARCHER: Archer to Lieutenant Reed.
REED [OC]: Go ahead.
ARCHER: Get a team down to the Command centre on the double.
REED [OC]: Aye sir.
ARCHER: (to T'Pol) Wait here for Malcolm. Have everything brought to
Cargo Bay two. I've got to get this to Phlox.
TUCKER: What's going on?
T'POL: Come with me. (The Command centre now contains the bio-reactor
and three Xindi-Reptilians.)
 [Outside
warehouse - day]
 (Patrol
cars screech to a halt, a little bit sideways.)
OFFICER 1: Get out of the car.
OFFICER 2: He's on something.
OFFICER 1: Get out of the car. (He pulls driver's door open.) OFFICER 1: Keep your
hands where we can see them.
OFFICER 2: Come on. Come on.
LOOMIS: What's going on? (He is pushed against the car and frisked.)LOOMIS: Hey, hey,
hey, I didn't do anything.
OFFICER 1: We got a tip says you did.
OFFICER 2: You're just lucky all six of them are still alive. (The officer cuffs Loomis.)
LOOMIS: Those two cops who came to my place, they offered me a deal.
That's the only reason I helped them.
OFFICER 1: I don't know what you're talking about. Get him out of here.
LOOMIS: Those creature, the lizard people,
they're around here somewhere. You've got to find them.
OFFICER 2: No problem, we'll get right on that.
LOOMIS: Be careful, be careful. They've got ray guns.
OFFICER 2: Ray guns. Got it. (He puts Loomis in the patrol car.) OFFICER 2:Watch your
head.

Original Airdate: 14 Jan, 2004
  [Shuttlepod]
 (The
pod is flying over a Sphere.)
TUCKER: It's identical to the other two. Even the smallest features are
exactly the same.
TRAVIS: Like they came off an assembly line.
TUCKER: I'd like to see the factory that made these. Well, that's the
last sensor sweep. Should give T'Pol plenty to chew on for a while.
(They fly off through the cloaking barrier.)
TRAVIS: Power fluctuations.
(The lights go out, then come on again.)
TUCKER: I think we're getting the hang of this.
TRAVIS: We're coming up on the outer edge of the cloaking barrier.
 [Alien
ship]
(Watching the shuttlepod come into view again.)
YARRICK: They're
emerging, heading back to their ship.
D'JAMAT: Visual. (An image of Enterprise.) D'JAMAT: I want to know what kind of
armaments they're carrying. We may have found what we're looking for.
 [Command
centre]
 T'POL:
This new data should help us map the anomalies more accurately. I
should also be able to calculate the exact number of Spheres in the
Expanse.
ARCHER: Any new theories on their purpose?
T'POL: Not yet.
REED [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Archer here.
REED [OC]: We've picked up a vessel approaching at impulse. They're
transmitting a distress signal.
 [Bridge]
 REED:
They're trapped in a cluster of anomalies. They've taken engine damage.
ARCHER: Let's see them.
(Ahe alien ship appears on the viewscreen.)
T'POL: Twenty three biosigns.
ARCHER: Hail them. This is Captain Jonathan Archer of the starship
Enterprise. Can we assist you?
D'JAMAT [OC]: Enterprise, we've suffered heavy damage. Our engines are
inoperative, our life support system is failing. Please assist us.
ARCHER: What kind of weapons do they have?
REED: Minimal.
ARCHER: Can you get us through the anomalies?
T'POL: I believe I can plot a safe course.
ARCHER: Full impulse.
(Enterprise reaches the stricken little ship.)
REED: Their life support system's failed.
ARCHER: Take full security precautions. Make sure none of them are
armed.
 [Sickbay]
 (With
the ship docked alongside - and it is small compared to Enterprise -
it's people are being treated.)
PHLOX: You'll be fine. Next case please.
MAN: Thank you, Doctor.
ARCHER: How are they?
PHLOX: I'm unable to perform detailed bioscans.
ARCHER: Why?
PHLOX: They have an aversion to any kind of invasive medical care, for
religious reasons. However, I have managed to ascertain that aside from
some minor injuries and one slight case of malnutrition, they appear to
be fine.
ARCHER: They're no strangers to anomalies. That looks like an old scar.
PHLOX: I found similar injuries on four others. Apparently they've been
in the vicinity of the sphere for several months.
ARCHER: Which one's the Captain? (Phlox indicates D'Jamat, a humanoid with grey hair pulled back into
a ponytail, and a red mark on the right hand side of his face - just
like the rest of them.)
PHLOX: He prefers the term Pri'Nam, a religious
designation.
ARCHER: I'm Captain Archer. Welcome aboard.
D'JAMAT: (shaking his hand) My name is D'Jamat. I can't express how
grateful we are. You saved our lives.
ARCHER: I understand you've been in this region for quite some time.
D'JAMAT: Yes, we're on a pilgrimage to the twelfth Sphere. It's taken
us a year to make the journey.
ARCHER: Your ship's in pretty rough shape. My engineer's taking a look
at it.
D'JAMAT: It's an old vessel, but sturdy. Unfortunately we are better at
prayer than we are at space travel.
ARCHER: Maybe there's some information about the Spheres we can share.
If you're feeling up to it, I'd like you to have dinner with me and my
Science Officer tonight.
D'JAMAT: I'd be honoured to accept your hospitality, Captain.
 [Captain's
mess]
D'JAMAT: Our home world is called Triannon. It's six point three light
years from here in the Maradas star cluster. Have you heard of it?
ARCHER: Doesn't ring a bell. We're new to the Expanse.
D'JAMAT: The Expanse? You mean the Chosen Realm.
ARCHER: I think we're talking about the same thing. We're here to learn
everything about a species you may have run into, the Xindi?
D'JAMAT: I'm not familiar with them. We place very little emphasis on
meeting other lifeforms. Space travel for us is merely a means to bring
us closer to the Spheres.
T'POL: You've studied them for some time?
D'JAMAT: We're not here to study the Spheres, we're here to venerate
them. We believe that it is through prayer and meditation that the
Makers become manifest.
ARCHER: The Makers?
D'JAMAT: The creators of the Spheres. I've felt their presence here.
(He shows a scar on his arm.)
T'POL: You're referring to spatial anomalies.
D'JAMAT: The Maker's Breath. It reshapes reality, allows ordinary men a
glimpse of the divine.
T'POL: That Breath nearly destroyed your ship.
D'JAMAT: Well, we became careless. It's easy to do when you're in the
presence of a Sphere.
ARCHER: They're certainly impressive. We've found three of them so far.
D'JAMAT: You're fortunate to have such a fast ship. I regret that I'll
die having seen only one of the many thousands of Spheres.
T'POL: Actually, we've determined that there are fifty nine Spheres in
the Expanse.
D'JAMAT: I think your estimates are a bit low.
T'POL: That's doubtful.
D'JAMAT: With the Makers there is no doubt.
T'POL: Doubt is the basis of all scientific progress.
D'JAMAT: Scientific progress has led many people astray.
ARCHER: Perhaps this is a subject we should discuss some other time?
D'JAMAT: I agree, Captain.
ARCHER: You'll be glad to know my engineer believes that he can repair
the damage to your vessel. He thinks it shouldn't take more than a
couple of days.
D'JAMAT: That is good news. I certainly hope that we'll have the
opportunity to repay your kindness.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX:
May I help you?
INDAVA: (a pretty young woman) I'd like to speak with you.
PHLOX: What is it? Are you feeling ill?
INDAVA: I wanted to ask you about a certain procedure. I'm sorry, it's
very difficult for me to talk about.
PHLOX: Why don't you have a seat? I was about to make some Janaran tea.
Would you like some?
INDAVA: Yes, thank you.
 [Mess
hall]
D'JAMAT: Is everyone in place?
YARRICK: Yes. They're just waiting for your signal.
D'JAMAT: You sound hesitant.
YARRICK: I'm sorry Pri'Nam, but are you certain this is the right thing
to do?
D'JAMAT: Do you think this ship just came to us by coincidence? This
encounter was clearly ordained by the Makers.
YARRICK: But these people risked their lives to save us.
D'JAMAT: They desecrated a Sphere. What we are about to do is not just
for our salvation, but for theirs as well. I know it can be difficult.
We've been away from home for a long time, but we have been given the
means to end the bloodshed for once and for all. Don't lose your faith
now, Yarrick.
YARRICK: Never, Pri'Nam.
 [Ready
room]
 ARCHER:
They believe that god-like beings they call the Makers created the
Spheres a thousand years ago.
T'POL: We have determined that the Spheres are nearly a thousand years
old.
ARCHER: Well. they also believe that the Makers are using the Spheres
to reshape the Expanse, creating a paradise for when they return.
T'POL: Mythology often has a basis in fact.
ARCHER: Come in.
D'JAMAT: Am I disturbing you?
ARCHER: Not at all.
T'POL: Excuse me. (She leaves.)
D'JAMAT: I said before that I hoped to be able to repay your kindness.
ARCHER: That isn't necessary.
D'JAMAT: It's already underway. Captain Archer, you, your crew, this
vessel, are all about to embark on a glorious mission. At this moment a
number of my people have taken positions around your vessel. Their
bodies have been equipped with powerful organic explosives. With a
single command I can order any one of them to sacrifice their lives.
(He speaks Triannon into his communicator)
 [Corridor]
 MAN:
Cala detash. Shika venus tikel. Shika venus tikel. Shika venus tikel.
(He kneels down and injects himself with the insignia emblem they all
wear, as a crewwoman stares. His veins expand then a hole is blown in
the hull.)
 [Bridge]
 REED:
There's been an explosion on C deck. We've got a hull breach.
ARCHER: Seal off the area. Get security teams
D'JAMAT: Stop. Two of my men are positioned next to your warp reactor.
Unless you turn this ship over to me, I'll destroy it.
 [Sickbay]
 (The
Triannons have raided the Armoury and put non-essential personnel under
guard. Some have evidently fought back.)
PHLOX: He has severe burns! The other two are suffering from the
effects of rapid decompression. They need immediate medical attention.
YARRICK: My orders are to escort everyone to their quarters.
PHLOX: I will not leave without treating these people.
YARRICK: Watch him.
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER:
They say they'll destroy Enterprise. I have to believe them.
TUCKER: I can't believe you're going along with this.
ARCHER: Remember what's at stake, why we're out here. Right now we
don't have a choice. Don't take any action against them. Is that clear?
TUCKER: Aye, Captain.
ARCHER: This isn't over. (leaves)
TUCKER: Make yourself at home.
 [Archer's
quarters]
D'JAMAT: You made the right decision. I promise you your people won't
be harmed.
ARCHER: You just murdered one of my people.
D'JAMAT: I had to erase any doubts you might have had about our
resolve.
ARCHER: What do you want with my ship?
D'JAMAT: When I'm satisfied the situation is secure, I'll answer your
questions. I also lost a crewman in that explosion, Captain. I'll say a
prayer for them both. (leaves)
ARCHER: Save your breath.
 [Bridge]
D'JAMAT: (to Travis) Were you given the coordinates for Triannon? Set
a course. Your highest warp factor. (to T'Pol) Prepare to fire two of
your torpedoes. Target my ship's reactor. You heard me. Release the
docking clamps. (The Triannon ship is destroyed)
 [Deleted
scene - Situation room]
YARRICK: A strike here will cut off their supply route.
D'JAMAT: No, I don't want a victory by attrition. We're going to
assault their positions directly.
T'POL: (under armed guard at her station) If you use Enterprise to
attack your enemies you may prevail, but your war will not end. (gets
up and walks over) Vulcan was once torn by violent conflict. Numerous
factions with opposing doctrines on logic. Each decisive victory drove
the defeated faction underground until they could regroup and fight
again. The cycle perpetuated itself for centuries. Only when we
embraced non-violence did we achieve peace.
D'JAMAT: We also plan to embrace non-violence. As soon as the heretics
are eliminated.
T'POL: That's illogical. It's not possible to eradicate everyone who
disagrees with you.
D'JAMAT: With the help of the Makers, all things are possible.
 [Command
centre]
D'JAMAT: I promised you an explanation. I owe you that.
ARCHER: Where are you taking this ship?
D'JAMAT: To my homeworld. We'll be there in three days. For the last
century, a violent group of heretics have tried to undermine our way of
life. With your ship I can deliver a final, decisive attack. I can end
this conflict forever.
ARCHER: A war. That was the glorious mission you were talking about?
D'JAMAT: I'm trying to save my people.
ARCHER: Why do I have the feeling these heretics would say the same
thing.
D'JAMAT: They might very well, but it doesn't change what they are.
Enemies of the truth.
ARCHER: Your truth.
D'JAMAT: There's only one.
ARCHER: How many people do you intend to kill with my ship?
D'JAMAT: Your species is obsessed with numbers. A characteristic of
your misguided belief that the secrets of the universe can be revealed
through science. This may sound barbaric to you, but it doesn't matter
how many heretics die. When the Makers return, only the faithful will
survive. Non-believers will be swept away. Not only Triannons, but
every race within the Chosen Realm.
ARCHER: Doctrines like that make it real easy to wipe out everyone who
doesn't agree with you.
D'JAMAT: You're wrong. It's not easy. If it were, I wouldn't be
dreading what I have to do next. I've been reviewing your records.
You've committed terrible acts of desecration. Not only have you flown
within the cloaking barrier of three Spheres, you've landed on one and
entered another. For crimes of this magnitude my faith obligates me to
destroy your ship and put your crew to death. However, I cannot ignore
the fact that you put yourselves at risk to save us, and that I like
you, Captain. I believe you're an honourable man, so I am going against
what my faith dictates. I'm going to temper the punishment. As
Commander of this ship you may choose one member of your crew to give
up their life.
ARCHER: You're out of your mind.
D'JAMAT: If you won't choose, I'll choose for you. I take no pleasure
in this, Captain, believe me.
ARCHER: I need time to think about this.
D'JAMAT: You have six hours. I urge you to use this time to search
within yourself, and put these lies out of your mind. All of this data
that you've collected must be erased from existence. (He starts deleting
the sensor files.19.3 XB are gone in seconds) D'JAMAT: Six hours, Captain.
 [Archer's
quarters]
YARRICK: An update on the repairs to your ship. D'Jamat felt you should
be kept appraised.
ARCHER: That's very considerate of him. Wait a minute. Your name's
Yarrick, isn't it?
YARRICK: It is.
ARCHER: I understand your wife paid a visit to Sickbay. She had a long
talk with my doctor. She's pregnant.
YARRICK: Yes.
ARCHER: I guess you also know she wants to end the pregnancy.
YARRICK: That's between her and me.
ARCHER: My doctor got the impression that she doesn't exactly agree
with D'Jamat's interpretation of your faith. As a matter of fact, Phlox
said she's grown to hate everything about it.
YARRICK: That's not true.
ARCHER: He also got the impression that you're not happy with the way
things are going either.
YARRICK: D'Jamat is my spiritual leader. I will follow him to my death.
ARCHER: From what I've seen, I'm pretty sure you're going to have that
opportunity.
 [Corridor]
YARRICK: You went to the doctor. You've put us at risk. He told his
Captain.
INDAVA: Does D'Jamat know?
YARRICK: I don't think so. Did you have the procedure?
INDAVA: No, the doctor said he needed time to review our physiology.
He's under guard now. It's too late.
YARRICK: It's just as well.
INDAVA: Have you changed your mind?
YARRICK: I'm not certain it's the right thing to do.
INDAVA: I won't watch my son or daughter fight in D'Jamat's war.
YARRICK: We have the ship now. We'll end the war once and for all.
INDAVA: You don't believe that any more than I do.
 [Ready
room]
D'JAMAT: Enter. Ah, I'm glad you've come. I was just looking at your
Captain's Logs. I had no idea we were such kindred spirits.
ARCHER: What makes you think that.
D'JAMAT: I know why you're here, in the Expanse. It turns out we're
both fighting to save our people.
ARCHER: I'm trying to stop my world from being destroyed. You're trying
to wipe out everyone who doesn't share your beliefs.
D'JAMAT: Our situations aren't as different as you think.
ARCHER: I draw the line at murdering innocent people.
D'JAMAT: And not torture? In your log there is an incident with a
prisoner. An interrogation that made use of an airlock.
ARCHER: I needed information critical to my mission. He wasn't hurt.
D'JAMAT: I sympathise with you, Captain. I've had to make hard choices
as well. When I was young, I fought with the Holy Regiments. I was
commanding a mission. We'd infiltrated a village known to be a heretic
stronghold. We were instructed to stay concealed and relay intelligence
about enemy movements, but one of the villagers discovered us. It was a
small boy, no more than six years old. We knew if we let him go he
would alert the village, and if we tried to hold him he might give us
away. There was only one action to take, so I took it.
ARCHER: You're proud of that.
D'JAMAT: In the service of the Makers, all actions are blessed ones.
ARCHER: There are no Makers. At least, not how you perceive them. The
Spheres are machines built for a reason you and I don't understand.
D'JAMAT: I was once like you, but then I felt the Breath. I prayed for
you, Captain. I had hoped that the Makers would open your eyes to the
truth, but it seems that they've turned away. You had a choice to make.
ARCHER: I've made it.
D'JAMAT: And which crew member have you selected?
ARCHER: I've chosen myself. You wanted to kill someone, kill me.
D'JAMAT: I urge you to reconsider.
ARCHER: I won't make someone else pay for something that happened under
my command.
D'JAMAT: But what about your mission? When I'm through with your ship,
your crew will need their Captain.
ARCHER: T'Pol's a fine commander.
D'JAMAT: We are more alike than you think, Captain. I would make the
same choice. I respect your decision.
ARCHER: Then maybe you'll grant a request.
D'JAMAT: What is it.
ARCHER: My people have certain customs regarding death. There's a
device on board. We use it to dispose of hazardous materials but, on
rare occasions, when the situation arises, we've also used it for
executions. It's considered humane.
D'JAMAT: Where is this device?
 [Transporter alcove]
 (T'Pol
dematerialises a box as a demonstration for D'Jamat and Yarrick.)
ARCHER: The molecules have been disassembled. Quick and painless.
D'JAMAT: I can't chance your mind?
ARCHER: No more than I can change yours.
D'JAMAT: Very well. Proceed.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: Ask Phlox to keep an eye on Porthos. Take care of Enterprise.
(He steps onto the transporter pad.) ARCHER: This won't end here. (And disappears.)
D'JAMAT: You have my sympathies. You should inform your crew. They
deserve to know.
 [Command
centre]
D'JAMAT: You've been quiet.
YARRICK: I'm just thinking about what's ahead, Pri'Nam.
D'JAMAT: I know you too well. Tell me what's wrong.
YARRICK: We've just begun this mission and already three people are
dead.
D'JAMAT: And that bothers you.
YARRICK: Shouldn't it? These people are not our enemy.
D'JAMAT: They are non-believers. That makes them our enemy.
YARRICK: Why?
D'JAMAT: Do you believe the Makers speak through me?
YARRICK: Yes.
D'JAMAT: Then when you question me, you question the Makers, and
there's a word for that. Heresy. Yarrick, when you begin to sympathise
with the enemy you risk becoming the enemy.
 [Sickbay]
 (Phlox
gets a text message on a monitor.)
ARCHER [text]: Don't feed him cheese. Can you talk?
PHLOX [text]: Go ahead.
ARCHER [text]: Can you neutralise the organic explosives?
PHLOX [text]: Need Triannon internal scans.
(The guard approaches and he clears the screen.)
PHLOX: Can I help you? (In a corridor, Archer jumps a Triannon and
knocks him out.)
 [Jefferies
tube]
 ARCHER:
I know, medical scans are against your beliefs. I don't think the
Makers will mind.
(He transmits the data to Phlox's monitor.)
 [Ready
room]
D'JAMAT: Enter.
JAREB: Lyaal's missing. He's not at his station.
D'JAMAT: (into communicator) Lyaal. Lyaal. We'll use the ship's
internal sensors to find him.
 [Bridge]
D'JAMAT: I need to locate one of my men. (The lights flicker.)
TRAVIS: We're dropping out of warp.
T'POL: Main power is being disrupted.
D'JAMAT: From where?
T'POL: I can't identify the location.
 [Engineering]
 (Archer
is pulling leads and cables out everywhere.)
TUCKER: I'm telling you, I didn't do anything. Ask your flunky over
here. He's been looking over my shoulder the whole time.
NALBIS: It's true. He never left my sight.
D'JAMAT: This did not happen by accident.
NALBIS: Pri'Nam, there's something wrong with the EPS manifolds on deck
D, section J15.
D'JAMAT: Yarrick, go with him.
 [Corridor]
 NALBIS:
It's on the left.
ARCHER: You past it. (Archer shoots him.) ARCHER: You don't want to do that.
YARRICK: You can't win. They'll destroy the ship.
ARCHER: Not if you help me.
YARRICK: No.
ARCHER: You know this is wrong. Everything he'd doing, we can put a
stop to it. All of it.
YARRICK: I won't betray my faith.
ARCHER: Your faith betrayed you. Is this really what the Makers want?
To kill people by the thousands in their name? Is that the faith you
were raised in?
YARRICK: No.
ARCHER: Then do what's right. If you don't help me, you'll be
condemning your wife and child to death, because that's how this is
going to end. As long as people like D'Jamat dictate what's true and
what isn't, all you'll ever have is war.
 [Bridge]
D'JAMAT: Have you located Lyaal?
JAREB: Internal sensors aren't functioning. Systems are down all over
the ship.
(Another alarm beeps.)
D'JAMAT: What is it?
TRAVIS: There's a convoy of ships approaching.
D'JAMAT: Let me see them.
(Four Triannon design ships appear on the viewscreen.)
 [Jefferies
tube]
 ARCHER:
These people you're fighting. What makes them heretics?
YARRICK: We believe the Makers created the Chosen Realm in nine days.
They believe it took ten.
ARCHER: For that, you've been at war for over a century? Found it.
YARRICK: What is it?
ARCHER: The environmental controls need to be re-routed to Sickbay.
That can only be done from the Bridge. I'm going to show you how to do
it.
YARRICK: Why?
ARCHER: Doctor Phlox has synthesised an airborne agent. It neutralises
one of the enzymes used in the organic explosives, renders it inert.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL:
They're hailing us.
D'JAMAT: Surrender now.(The Triannon on the viewscreen has a blue mark on the left side of his
face.) 
CERIS [on viewscreen]: I have four ships.
D'JAMAT: If you had ten ships you wouldn't survive against this vessel.
Run your scans. You'll see that I'm telling the truth. Surrender and
you'll be treated fairly.
CERIS [on viewscreen]: You consider us heretics. We know what you do to
them, D'Jamat.
D'JAMAT: Target the lead vessel. Do what I say.
T'POL: No. (She is replaced by Jareb.)
D'JAMAT: Prepare to fire torpedoes. (Two hit their target.)
JAREB: One of the ships has lost engines.
D'JAMAT: Target their main reactor. (T'Pol tries to stop him but fails.
The ship is destroyed and a shooting match begins, shaking Enterprise.)
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox's bat 'gets' loose in the attack.)
PHLOX: Don't worry, it's harmless unless it's agitated. (His minder
ducks as it flaps near him.)
 [Reed's
quarters]
 REED:
Captain. (Archer hands over a weapon.)
ARCHER: We have to get to the Armoury. We're
retaking the ship. We need the MACOs.
 [Bridge]
YARRICK: Pri'Nam.
D'JAMAT: It's begun. What's the status of the engines?
YARRICK: We've located the problem. It's under repair. The warp reactor
should be functioning in a few hours.
JAREB: They're retreating.
D'JAMAT: Stay with them. (He puts a gun to Travis's head.) D'JAMAT: Do what I say!
(T'Pol nods) Bring us within firing distance. Prepare to lock weapons.
(Meanwhile, Yarrick accesses the environmental controls.)
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX:
Careful, there's no antidote for the venom. (Phlox injects the guard as he
ducks away from the bat.) PHLOX: There'll be an extra helping of snow beetles for you
tonight, young lady. (He puts the jar of blue liquid into the
environmental system.)
 [Bridge]
 (As
Yarrick inputs commands on a screen at the back,)
JAREB: Their engines are at maximum. We're still gaining.
D'JAMAT: Good. We'll eliminate them one by one.
(Phlox sees the antidote enter the ship's systems.)
 [Armoury]
 (After
a shooting match)
TRIANNON: Hold your fire. (He drops his weapons and comes down the steps.)
REED: Don't move. (The Triannon injects himself but nothing happens. He
tries to run but is stunned.)
 [Bridge]
 JAREB:
They're coming into range.
D'JAMAT: Lock weapons.
(Another torpedo hit, and a piece of the Triannon ship falls off.
There's another gun fight, this time in Engineering. Again, a Triannon
discovers the explosive doesn't work anymore.  There's
fisticuffs in a corridor for Reed and Cole. When his phase
rifle runs out of charge. Indava saves Reed's life.)
YARRICK: They're sending a transmission. They want to surrender.
D'JAMAT: Continue firing.
JAREB: Weapons aren't functioning.
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to the Bridge. We've rerouted command functions to
Engineering. I've taken weapons offline.
D'JAMAT: Find him.
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER:
We've also neutralised your organic explosives.
D'JAMAT [OC]: You're lying.
ARCHER: Go ahead, try to blow yourself up.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER
[OC]: I'll wait.
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER:
Stand down before anyone else gets hurt.
 [Bridge]
D'JAMAT: You know I won't do that.
JAREB: Pri'Nam! They're coming about.
D'JAMAT: They're firing again, Captain. I suggest you bring your
weapons back online. Are you willing to sacrifice the lives of your
crew?
(Reed and the MACOs enter the Bridge. Naturally, there's a gun battle.
T'Pol takes a weapon from the fallen Jareb and finally takes out
D'Jamat.)
REED: Captain, it's Reed. We have the Bridge. This'd be a lot easier if
I had weapons back.
ARCHER [OC]: Stand by. (He enters the Bridge.) ARCHER: Hail them. (T'Pol opens a
channel.) ARCHER: This is Captain Archer. D'Jamat is no longer in control of
this vessel. Please respond. We've retaken the ship. I'm in command
again.
CERIS [on viewscreen]: Why should I believe you?
ARCHER: I'm powering down my weapons. See for yourself.
T'POL: They're moving off.
 [Brig]
(D'Jamat is sitting, meditating or praying when Archer opens the door
and goes in.)
ARCHER: We just entered orbit around Triannon. Let's go.
D'JAMAT: You've done a terrible thing, Captain. You've interfered with
something that was ordained. After centuries of fighting, I was going
to bring an end to the war. We would have had peace.
ARCHER: Peace? One of my crewmen is dead, six others are wounded, my
ship is damaged.
D'JAMAT: None of that is important. All that matters is the sacred
truth.
ARCHER: You want truth? I'll show you some truth.
 [Triannon]
 (Two
shuttlepods land on a planet which has been utterly devastated by war.
All the buildings are rubble. Scarcely one brick left upon another.)
ARCHER: From what we've been able to learn, this happened eight months
ago. Both sides have been decimated. There are no major cities left.
Millions are dead. Your faith was going to bring peace? Here it is.

Ground
 Mission Date: Dec 6, 2153
Original Airdate: 21 Jan, 2004
 
ARCHER [OC]: Previously on Enterprise
ARCHER [Bridge]
: Status.
T'POL: We're getting reports of anomalies on all decks.
ARCHER [OC]: If we continue, there's a good chance this ship is going
to get torn apart.
DEGRA [Xindi Council Chamber]: Think
what you're asking me to do. Build a weapon to destroy an entire world.
HUMANOID: We do not have enough information about the humans.
REPTILIAN: That can be remedied.
HOSHI [Bridge]:
They're locking onto the starboard docking port.
HOSHI [OC]: I'm reading twenty three intruders on decks C, D and E.
DEGRA [Weapon lab]: We're
preparing to test the weapon on an uninhabited planet, but we're going
to need another shipment of kemocite.
REPTILIAN: I'll contact Gralik.
ARCHER [Gralik's home]:
Gralik, I have some questions for you. I want to know where they're
shipping this kemocite. It could lead us to the weapon.
TUCKER [Engineering]:
There's no doubt about it, Captain. This isotope was used in the weapon
that attacked Earth.
ARCHER [Cave]: You
offered to help us. Are you still willing?
GRALIK: If you're prepared to trust me.
HOSHI [Transporter bay]: We've
modified the radiolitic signature. If you can get it on board their
ship, I'll be able to track it.
ARCHER [Gralik's home]:
Degra's going to discover that you sabotaged his kemocite.
GRALIK: You should just be concerned with finding this weapon.
TRAVIS [Bridge]: They
broke orbit five minutes ago, Captain.
ARCHER [OC]: Are you picking up the tracking signal?
HOSHI: Loud and clear.
 [Shran's Ready room]
 (Shran is pouring himself a glass of water when the
intercom beeps)
SHRAN: Yes.
TALAS [OC]: Commander Shran, would you come to the Bridge.
 [IW Kumari Bridge]
 SHRAN: Status.
TALAS: (a female) We've lost the warp trail.
SHRAN: Continue scanning. You know what we're looking for, Lieutenant.
It shouldn't be that difficult to find.
TALAS: Commander. We've been searching for weeks.
SHRAN: And we'll continue searching until we've accomplished our
mission.
TALAS: Or until we're destroyed? You've seen what this place is like.
What are the chances they've survived?
SHRAN: We have our orders.
TALAS: We should head back to Andoria while we're still able.
SHRAN: You sound like you're afraid of this Expanse, Lieutenant. I'd
expect that from a Vulcan, not a member of the Imperial Guard.
TALAS: Continue scanning.
SHRAN: Don't underestimate these pinkskins, Lieutenant. They're still
out there.
 [Xindi Council Chamber]
 DEGRA: Where are the others?
HUMANOID: Delayed.
DEGRA: I said the matter was urgent.
REPTILIAN: Typical humanoid arrogance. You expect us to come scurrying
whenever it suits you.
DEGRA: I'm sorry to inconvenience you, but I'm sure you'll find the
journey worth the effort.
ARBOREAL: The weapon is ready?
DEGRA: Not quite.
REPTILIAN: Then why are you wasting our time?
DEGRA: The new prototype has been completed. We've scheduled a test.
REPTILIAN: When?
DEGRA: Three days. You'll be able to view the test remotely from this
chamber. If everything goes as planned, we should be ready to deploy
the final version in a month, maybe sooner.
HUMANOID: And the human threat will finally be eliminated.
DEGRA: I hope you find that worth your time.
 [Command centre]
 HOSHI: The signal was so weak I wasn't even sure
it was there at first.
ARCHER: But you are now.
HOSHI: Yes, sir. The isotopic signature matches the kemocite that you
planted on the Xindi ship.
ARCHER: Set a course. Tell Trip I want everything he can give me from
the engines.
T'POL: Captain, as you know, Ensign Sato and I have been working to
reconstruct our database.
ARCHER: And?
HOSHI: We've managed to dig about thirty percent of our lost data out
of the redundant memory core.
T'POL: Enough to begin piecing together a map of the spatial anomalies.
The signal lies just beyond a dense field of them.
HOSHI: Here.
ARCHER: How long to go around it?
T'POL: A field this massive? Seventeen days at warp five.
ARCHER: Alert the crew. It's going to get rough.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Tucker to the Bridge.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
TUCKER: I've got the warp reactor buttoned up.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER [OC]: We're as ready as we'll ever be.
ARCHER: Acknowledged. T'Pol?
T'POL: I've charted the largest anomalies, but the field is extremely
dense. We may not be able to avoid all of them.
ARCHER: Do your best. Travis, take us in. One half impulse.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
T'POL: Come to bearing two seven five mark eight. Hard to port!
REED: We just grazed it. No damage.
ARCHER: Just how accurate is this map of yours?
T'POL: Considering I only have thirty percent of our database to work
with. There's an anomaly forming directly ahead. It's expanding.
ARCHER: Expanding?
T'POL: I've never seen this before. They're merging, building on one
another.
TRAVIS: Which way, Sub-Commander?
T'POL: It's growing too rapidly.
ARCHER: Emergency power to hull plating. Brace for impact.
(A big green nasty passes all the way through the ship, causing bangs
and injuries.)
REED: We're losing hull integrity. Atmosphere's venting on D deck.
ARCHER: Come about. Get us out of here.
TRAVIS: The helm's not responding.
T'POL: We've been completely enveloped.
REED: Main power's going down.
TRAVIS: Sir, I'm picking up something out there. I think it's a ship.
ARCHER: Can you identify it?
TRAVIS: There's too much distortion.
T'POL: A tractor beam's locked on to us. We've been pulled out.
HOSHI: They're hailing us.
ARCHER: I guess we owe someone a thank-you.
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: Captain Archer. Look at the trouble you've
gotten your pink skin into this time.
 [Ready room]
 SHRAN: You're braver than I imagined. I wouldn't
try to traverse an anomaly field in a ship this fragile.
ARCHER: You don't seem to be having any trouble.
SHRAN: We've discovered a few tricks to deal with them.
T'POL: How did you locate us?
SHRAN: We have a record of your warp signature from our last encounter.
Our ships are considerably faster than Enterprise. It wasn't difficult
to catch up with you.
ARCHER: That explains how you got here. It doesn't explain why.
SHRAN: Your world was brutally attacked. The Imperial Guard thought
you'd be grateful to have an ally, considering no one else came rushing
to your aid.
T'POL: And how did the Imperial Guard know Earth had been attacked?
SHRAN: Seven million killed? Not exactly a state secret.
T'POL: Especially if you're monitoring communications between Starfleet
and the Vulcan High Command.
SHRAN: What happened to your uniform, Sub-Commander? Not that I don't
find your new look becoming, but it's not exactly regulation, is it?
T'POL: I resigned my commission.
SHRAN: Yes, I believe I heard something about that.
ARCHER: Why are you here?
SHRAN: Your world is in jeopardy, and where are your friends, the
Vulcans? Where is their mighty fleet? They couldn't even spare one
officer. She was forced to abandon her career to remain on your ship. A
remarkably selfless act, for a Vulcan. But we've come to your aid.
We've come into the Expanse when they refused. We're here to help you.
If you don't want our assistance, we'll leave you to deal with the
Xindi on your own. Just like the Vulcans have done.
 [Armoury]
 REED: Targeting sensors are down, hull plating.
We're damn lucky the torpedoes were all in safe mode. If one of them
had detonated.
ARCHER: Phase cannons?
REED: They haven't even got enough power to light a camp fire.
ARCHER: How long to fix them?
REED: I couldn't even guess without a chance to sort this out.
ARCHER: Commander Shran offered to send his Tactical Officer over to
help.
REED: We'd be giving them access to critical systems, sir.
ARCHER: The kemocite signal Hoshi picked up could lead us to the Xindi
weapon. We're going to need our defences. I don't like the idea of
having the Andorians down here any more than you do, but we could use
their help.
REED: Aye, sir.
 [Corridor]
 T'POL: The Andorian shuttle has docked.
ARCHER: Good. Let's put them to work.
T'POL: I recommend we assign a security detail to each repair crew.
ARCHER: You been talking to Lieutenant Reed? They're here to help,
T'Pol.
T'POL: That doesn't mean we shouldn't exercise caution.
ARCHER: I'm not going to ask them to work with guns at their heads just
because you don't like them.
T'POL: I neither like nor dislike Andorians. I've simply had a great
deal of experience with them.
ARCHER: I appreciate that, but whatever problems exist between Vulcan
and Andoria don't involve us.
T'POL: Not at the moment. We weren't always so antagonistic, Captain.
In fact, despite their heightened emotions, our first contact with
Andorians seemed promising.
ARCHER: What happened?
T'POL: They were duplicitous. They only honoured agreements that didn't
conflict with their interests.
ARCHER: Is that your assessment or the High Commands?
T'POL: Considering the importance of this mission, I feel compelled to
point out that they've proven untrustworthy in the past.
ARCHER: I don't trust them either, T'Pol, but based on my experience I
think I can trust Commander Shran.
 [Mess hall]
 REED: Coffee, black.
TUCKER: No tea?
REED: Yeah, no crumpets either, thank you. I need all the caffeine I
can get. What's the situation in Engineering?
TUCKER: Bad. The Armoury?
REED: Worse.
TALAS: Which one of you is Reed?
REED: I'm Lieutenant Reed.
TALAS: I assumed I'd find you in the Armoury, not relaxing here. What
is that?
REED: It's coffee, and just for the record, I haven't left the Armoury
for so much as a bathroom break in nearly twelve hours. And you are?
TALAS: Lieutenant Talas of the Imperial Warship Kumari.
REED: This is Commander Tucker, our Chief Engineer.
TUCKER: Pleasure.
TALAS: I've been ordered to assist you.
REED: Indeed. Well, I'll see if I can find something for you to do.
TALAS: I have duties of my own. The sooner your ship is repaired, the
sooner I can get back to them.
TUCKER: Well, I'll let you two get acquainted.
 [Captain's Mess]
 SHRAN: I wasn't sure we'd find you alive. Under
the circumstances, I'd say we have something to celebrate. (He produces
two glasses and a tall curvy bottle of something blue.)
ARCHER: I appreciate the gesture, but we have a lot of repairs to make.
SHRAN: And your crew's doing a fine job of making them. Have a drink
with me. You've earned a brief respite. Andorian ale. You seemed to
enjoy it the last time we met. I took the liberty of bringing a few
extra bottles. (Archer takes the small, half-filled glass.)
ARCHER: Thanks.
SHRAN: To a swift victory. (Shran knocks his back in one.)
ARCHER: So, how did you get picked for this assignment?
SHRAN: I volunteered. It made sense. I've had the greatest amount of
contact with pink, with humans, and the last time we met you helped my
people avert a war. I don't like unpaid debts.
ARCHER: We keep doing each other favours.
SHRAN: Isn't that how alliances are born? (They make another silent toast.)
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: I haven't seen you in a while. As long as
you're here, maybe you can give me a hand. Touch this onto the phase
regulator, there, while I check the polarity. I thought you might be
avoiding me.
T'POL: Three neuro-pressure sessions a week is hardly avoiding you. The
Captain asked for an update on your repairs.
TUCKER: Three of the injectors are burnt out, the restrictor coils are
completely fried.
T'POL: How long until we have warp?
TUCKER: I would say at least two days, but the blue guys really know
their stuff. Should be up and running in about twelve hours? Is there a
problem?
T'POL: No. Keep me informed of your progress.
 [Armoury]
 REED: Hand me the micro-spanner, please.
TALAS: I've brought some equipment that should align those relays much
more precisely.
REED: The spanner will do the job nicely. If you wouldn't mind.
TALAS: Is there anything else I can get you? Some coffee, perhaps?
REED: That'd be lovely.
TALAS: Since you clearly don't need my help, I'll return to my ship.
Thank you for the hospitality.
REED: Give my regards to Commander Shran.
TALAS: For what it's worth, Lieutenant, I'm not here to steal your
secrets. It would hardly be worth the effort.
REED: I beg your pardon?
TALAS: Last time I saw weapons like these was during my early tactical
training.
REED: I'm sorry I wasted your time on our primitive systems.
TALAS: Not at all. I found it nostalgic. Just be careful when you
reconnect that to your power grid. You didn't reset the EPS
synchroniser. You may singe your eyebrows when you bring it back
online.
REED: Lieutenant Talas. I apologise if I've been rude. Why don't I get
us both a cup of coffee and we can align these relays together.
 Captain's starlog, December 6th, 2153. With some
assistance from the Andorians we've managed to steer clear of
anomalies.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Two hundred million kilometres.
ARCHER: Close enough, Travis. We don't want to give ourselves away.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
T'POL: It's a G-type star system, six planets with over a hundred
moons.
ARCHER: Any biosigns?
T'POL: There's a great deal of debris in the system. I can't tell from
this range.
SHRAN: Our sensors are more sophisticated than yours. We should be able
to scan the system without betraying our presence. If I may? (into
communicator) This is Commander Shran.
ANDORIAN [OC]: Go ahead.
SHRAN: Transfer our long range sensor data to Enterprise.
ANDORIAN [OC]: Yes, Commander.
HOSHI: It's coming in. (image of a blue gas giant, a moon and four
ships on the viewscreen)
T'POL: Four vessels, all Xindi.
 [Command centre]
 T'POL: Many of the moons show evidence of
extensive weapons bombardment.
SHRAN: Why attack an uninhabited system?
ARCHER: I don't think they attacked anyone. It's Bikini Atoll.
SHRAN: What?
ARCHER: When my species was developing primitive nuclear weapons they
needed places to test them. One was a remote island called Bikini
Atoll.
T'POL: So you believe this is some kind of proving ground.
ARCHER: It's possible. If they are getting ready to test their weapon,
we're running out of time.
SHRAN: I wouldn't recommend a frontal assault. Your weapons are
damaged, critical systems are down all over your ship, and your
out-numbered four to one.
T'POL: I thought it was four to two.
SHRAN: Even our combined forces don't stand a chance against that kind
of firepower. I'm not ready to risk my ship when we don't even know if
the Xindi weapon is here.
ARCHER: I agree. We need to get a closer look.
SHRAN: What do you propose we do? Fly up to them and ask them what
they're doing?
 [Corridor]
 (Shran is being escorted by a crew member.)
TUCKER: Ensign.
ENSIGN: Commander.
TUCKER: I'll take him from here.
SHRAN: Mister Tucker. How are your repairs coming along?
TUCKER: Pretty well, thanks to your people, but I was wondering if I
could ask a favour. I'm told your anti-matter injectors use variable
compression nozzles.
SHRAN: Told by whom? That's rather sensitive information.
TUCKER: I don't want to get anyone in trouble, but one of those
injectors would work wonders for our engines.
SHRAN: I imagine it would. I don't know, Commander, that's a
sophisticated piece of technology.
TUCKER: I thought we were allies here.
SHRAN: That remains to be seen. You have my condolences over the attack
on your world.
TUCKER: Thanks.
SHRAN: I understand your sister was killed. Captain Archer told me.
TUCKER: Well, lots of people lost family.
SHRAN: No great victory comes without sacrifice. The dispute between my
people and the Vulcans hasn't been bloodless. Border skirmishes were
common a few decades ago. They'd violate our territory, we'd retaliate.
I was still in school when my older brother joined the Imperial Guard.
He was assigned to a forward surveillance unit. I can understand why
you seek vengeance against these Xindi.
TUCKER: I'd love to get my hands on whoever ordered that attack, but
that's not why we're here.
SHRAN: You have no desire to make these people pay for the death of
your sister?
TUCKER: I just want to make sure they don't get the chance to finish
what they started. (Tucker opens the airlock.) TUCKER: So, any help you can give us.
SHRAN: I'll have that anti-matter injector delivered to you.
TUCKER: I appreciate it.
 [Weapon control centre]
 HUMANOID [OC]: Degra, what's the delay?
DEGRA: Stand by.
 [Xindi Council chamber]
 REPTILIAN: We have been standing by for nearly an
hour.
DEGRA [OC]: We're confirming final
 [Weapon control centre]
 DEGRA: power readings. I wouldn't want you to be
disappointed with the results. Deploy the weapon.
(A big ball is dropped towards a moon.)
DEGRA: Initiate firing protocols.
(An alarm goes off)
 [Xindi Council chamber]
 REPTILIAN: What is it?
DEGRA [OC]: A ship just entered the system.
INSECTOID: What kind of ship?
 [Weapon control centre]
 DEGRA: We can't identify it. Abort the test.
Return the weapon to the launch platform.
 [Xindi Council chamber]
 ARBOREAL: Degra, report.
DEGRA [OC]: Stand by.
 [Weapon control centre]
 DEGRA: Activate all defence systems. Contact the
other vessels and have them intercept that ship.
 [Xindi Council chamber]
 HUMANOID: Degra!
DEGRA [OC]: We're securing the weapon.
 [Weapon control centre]
 DEGRA: I'll resume contact when I can.
THALEN: We're receiving a transmission from the ship.
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Shran.
 [IW Kumari Bridge]
 (Archer and T'Pol are out of sight at the side of
the Bridge.)
SHRAN: Of the Andorian Mining Consortium.
DEGRA [on viewscreen]: You've entered restricted space. Leave
immediately.
 [Weapon control centre]
 SHRAN [on viewscreen]: Restricted? I had no idea.
We don't want to cause any trouble. We're looking for a rare element
 [IW Kumari Bridge]
 SHRAN: Archerite. We picked up some promising
readings coming from your system.
DEGRA [on viewscreen]: I don't care what you're looking for. Turn your
ship around and leave.
SHRAN: Of course, of course, but you don't mind if we finish our scans?
Archerite is
 [Weapon control centre]
 SHRAN [on viewscreen]: Extremely valuable to us.
Even a few kilos will pay our expenses for the next ten cycles.
THALEN: They're scanning our ships.
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: We're not trying to violate your privacy.
 [IW Kumari Bridge]
 SHRAN: Our sensors are omni-directional. There's
nothing to be concerned about.
 [Weapon control centre]
 DEGRA: Deactivate your scans and leave, or we'll
destroy you.
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: There's no need for threats. We'll leave, but if
this system does contain archerite, you just missed out your
opportunity to collect a generous percentage.
 [IW Kumari Bridge]
 SHRAN: Stop the scan. Take us out of the system,
but not too quickly. The Andorian Mining Consortium runs from no one.
 [Command centre]
 (A fuzzy picture of the weapon is on the big
screen.)
T'POL: It's emitting high levels of radiation.
SHRAN: It could be anything. Power generator of some kind, fusion
reactor.
T'POL: It has the same quantum signature as the weapon that attacked
Earth.
ARCHER: What's the status of our repairs?
T'POL: Impulse and warp engines are nominal, hull plating's at eighty
two percent.
ARCHER: Weapons?
T'POL: Mister Reed reports the anomaly caused more damage that he
originally estimated.
ARCHER: How long?
T'POL: He isn't certain. Perhaps two days.
ARCHER: If they are here to test that thing, we may not have two days.
SHRAN: Why the urgency? This can't be the final version of the weapon.
T'Pol's analysis shows it isn't powerful enough to destroy an entire
planet. Let them run their tests. Why destroy this prototype when we
can see it in use and gauge it's destructive power?
ARCHER: I don't intend to destroy it. If we could get our hands on this
weapon, Starfleet might be able to figure out a defence. We're going to
take it.
 [Armoury]
 TALAS: The phase couplers are charging.
REED: All we have left is to reset the emitters.
TALAS: What's the frequency?
REED: I'll do it.
TALAS: You don't trust me.
REED: No offence, but when it comes to our weapons frequencies I
wouldn't trust my own mother.
TALAS: Is your mother considered a security risk?
REED: It's just an expression.
TALAS: An odd one. My mother's security clearance is higher than mine.
REED: Really.
TALAS: She commanded an Imperial Infantry Unit.
REED: You come from a military family.
TALAS: Four generations.
REED: Three, on my father's side.
TALAS: He must be disappointed in you.
REED: What?
TALAS: Betraying your family tradition by serving on a ship of
exploration.
REED: Actually, we haven't done much exploring for quite a while, but
since you ask, he wasn't very pleased. The Royal Navy was his life.
TALAS: Perhaps he'd feel differently if he saw you now, fighting for
the survival of your race.
REED: I'm sure he would. Right, all done. I'll power it up and we'll
see where we stand.
(when his back is turned, Talas points a blue light at the couplers)
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Report.
T'POL: They've launched the prototype.
ARCHER: Can we get a closer look?
SHRAN: This is Shran.
ANDORIAN [OC]: Yes, Commander.
SHRAN: Transfer our sensor telemetry to Enterprise.
(Both they and the Xindi Council watch as the crust of the moon is
shattered into dust, although the core remains intact.)
 [Xindi Council chamber]
 REPTILIAN: Are these the satisfying results you
promised?
INSECTOID: You said the moon would be destroyed.
 [Weapon control centre]
 DEGRA: The device was building to an overload. We
were forced to shut it down.
HUMANOID [OC]: Why?
 [Xindi Council chamber]
 HUMANOID: What happened?
DEGRA [OC]: I need
 [Weapon control centre]
 DEGRA: Time to analyse the data.
 [Xindi Council chamber]
 REPTILIAN: Time? We have given you more than
enough time. We were promised a weapon to destroy the humans in one
stroke, not hack away at them bit by bit.
AQUATIC: He's right, Degra. Our patience is wearing thin.
ARBOREAL: That moon was nearly split in two. Clearly, progress has been
made.
REPTILIAN: Not enough. Every failure puts us at risk.
HUMANOID: Degra
 [Weapon control centre]
 HUMANOID [OC]: Can the problem be rectified?
DEGRA: Once I've recovered the device, I'll have more information.
REPTILIAN: We hope so.
 [Command centre]
 (Watching a playback of the test.)
T'POL: The output was much greater than the probe that attacked Earth,
but still, I don't believe the device reached it's maximum yield. We
detected power fluctuations. It appears it was building toward an
overload.
SHRAN: Are you saying this was a failure?
T'POL: A spectacular one, but yes.
ARCHER: Gralik. An arboreal Xindi that we met at a facility that
manufactured one of the components for the weapon. He promised to help
us. Looks like he kept his word.
SHRAN: Why haven't they retrieved it?
T'POL: It's still emitting high levels of radiation.
ARCHER: How long until it's safe enough to get close?
T'POL: Six hours, at least.
ARCHER: We've got to get to it before they do. What if we shield the
launch bay, evacuate all the adjacent compartments. Could we bring it
aboard any sooner?
T'POL: Our shielding wouldn't be sufficient to protect the crew.
SHRAN: Use my ship. Our forcefield will contain the radiation. We'll
secure the device in our cargo bay until it's safe to transfer to
Enterprise.
ARCHER: That's a generous offer, but what are we supposed to do, cheer
you on?
SHRAN: It's four against two, remember? This would be a joint venture.
ARCHER: Archer to Lieutenant Reed.
 [Armoury]
 REED: Reed here, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: What's the status on weapons?
REED: Torpedoes are back online, and thanks to Lieutenant Talas we
should have phase cannons within the hour.
ARCHER [OC]: We're going to need them. Archer out.
TALAS: I wish we had more time. You're only going to get ninety four
percent efficiency from the phase cannons.
REED: I've never gotten them above ninety three. If you ever decide to
leave the Imperial Guard, Starfleet could certainly use you.
TALAS: And if you get tired of exploring, you'd do well in the Imperial
Guard.
 [Command centre]
 ARCHER: I appreciate your offer, Shran. We accept.
SHRAN: I'll return to my ship.
ARCHER: I'm going with you. I plan to be there when you bring the
weapon aboard.
SHRAN: That won't be necessary. We'll keep you informed.
ARCHER: That's not good enough. If something goes wrong.
SHRAN: Kumari is a warship with a battle-tested crew. They're capable
of performing their duties without you looking over their shoulders.
ARCHER: What happened to this being a joint venture?
SHRAN: We'll render whatever assistance we can, but my crew won't take
orders from you.
ARCHER: They're going to have to.
SHRAN: The Imperial Guard doesn't serve at your leisure, pinkskin.
ARCHER: This is my mission.
SHRAN: And you'd pass up your best chance for success over a matter of
pride?
ARCHER: This isn't about pride. The Xindi killed seven million humans,
not Andorians. I won't put the fate of my people in the hands of the
Imperial Guard. Now, we could use your help, but if you're not happy
with me calling the shots then we'll go it alone.
 [Shran's ready room]
 GENERAL [on viewscreen]: I've seen the scans you
transmitted, Commander. Impressive.
SHRAN: Archer's science officer believes the weapon is unstable. It
nearly overloaded.
GENERAL [on viewscreen]: The Vulcan.
SHRAN: I have no reason to doubt her assessment. She seems competent.
GENERAL [on viewscreen]: We'll review her data. Proceed as planned.
SHRAN: General, the humans may yet become valuable allies.
GENERAL [on viewscreen]: If your mission is successful, we won't need
an alliance with them, or anyone.
SHRAN: Why squander the opportunity? Is this mission worth making
enemies of them?
GENERAL [on viewscreen]: It's not up to you to determine the value of
this mission, Commander. I trust your regard for this pinkskin won't
cause you to forget that.
 [Armoury]
 REED: What are you doing? Why are you accessing
the sensors? They weren't damaged.
TALAS: Not by the anomaly. With all the bypasses we've been running, we
obviously could have created some additional problems.
REED: You're just being thorough.
TALAS: You wouldn't want to be in a battle with the Xindi and suddenly
find yourself flying blind.
REED: So, anything we need to worry about?
TALAS: Your lateral array was out of alignment. I corrected it. All
other systems are functioning properly. I'd take this ship into combat
myself.
REED: Even with our primitive weapons?
TALAS: It's not the weapon, it's the soldier who wields it.
(She struts away, and he checks what she was doing.)
 [Weapon control centre]
 DEGRA: What is it?
THALEN: A ship.
DEGRA: The Andorians?
THALEN: No. Biosigns are human.
DEGRA: Send the escort ships to intercept. We have to keep them away
from the weapon.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Two Xindi ships approaching.
T'POL: Tactical alert. Evasive manoeuvres, Ensign.
TRAVIS: Aye.
T'POL: Hail the Captain.
 [IW Kumari Bridge]
 T'POL [on viewscreen]: The two reptilian ships are
moving towards us. The other vessels are holding position.
ARCHER: Try to keep them busy.
T'POL [on viewscreen]: Acknowledged.
SHRAN: I await your orders.
ARCHER: Let's go get it.
SHRAN: Charge weapons. Set a course.
 [Weapon control centre]
 THALEN: Another vessel. It's the Andorian ship.
They're heading for the weapon.
DEGRA: They're working together. Get our ships back here now!
 [Bridge]
 (the reptilian design ships are attacking
Enterprise)
REED: Hull plating's holding.
T'POL: Return fire. Target their engines.
REED: They're breaking off.
TRAVIS: They're heading back into the system.
T'POL: Pursuit course, Ensign. Continue firing all weapons.
 [IW Kumari Bridge]
 (Meanwhile, a tractor beam has grabbed the weapon
and hauled it away.)
TALAS: We have it.
SHRAN: Take us out of the system, maximum speed. (the cargo bay doors
close on their acquisition) Are they following?
TALAS: No. The human vessel disabled main propulsion on both ships.
ARCHER: What about Enterprise?
TALAS: They've gone to warp. No apparent damage.
ARCHER: Contact T'Pol. Have her meet us at the rendezvous point. Is
there a problem?
SHRAN: Inform the Imperial Guard we have the weapon. Set a course for
Andoria, maximum warp.
ARCHER: What are you doing?
SHRAN: I'm afraid we won't be taking orders from you any longer.
ARCHER: Now I see why you generously offered to let us use your ship,
you son of a bitch.
SHRAN: I was ordered to retrieve the weapon by whatever means
necessary.
ARCHER: I'm starting to think the Vulcans may be right about you.
SHRAN: The Vulcans are the reason we're doing this.
ARCHER: What are you talking about?
SHRAN: For two hundred years all that's kept them from invading Andoria
is the threat of massive retaliation. With a weapon of this magnitude
at our disposal they wouldn't dare attack us.
ARCHER: You're putting Earth at risk because of a border dispute with
the Vulcans?
SHRAN: We disrupted the Xindi test, took their weapon. We may have
helped save your world.
ARCHER: I guess I'm not familiar with the Andorian concept of help.
SHRAN: I don't need to justify my actions to you, pinkskin. I swore an
oath to the Imperial Guard, my loyalty lies with them.
ARCHER: My crew won't let you take the weapon without a fight.
SHRAN: Your ship isn't fast enough to catch us.
ARCHER: You'll have to slow down to pass back through the anomaly
field.
SHRAN: I anticipated that. When Talas was working on Enterprise she
disrupted the main sensor array. They may be able to catch up to us,
but they'll have no way to find us. Archer (connects with a good left hook to Shran's jaw.)
ARCHER: You like to
talk about repaying debts. I've owed you that for a long time.
SHRAN: Take the Captain to an escape pod. Don't worry, I'll alert
Enterprise where to find you.
 [Corridor]
 T'POL: We disabled main power on both reptilian
ships. The other vessels aren't pursing us.
ARCHER: What about our sensors?
REED: Back online. You were right, sir. If I hadn't been watching that
Andorian officer it might have taken weeks to find where she'd
sabotaged the array.
ARCHER: Their ship?
T'POL: It's approaching the anomaly field.
REED: They've reduced speed. We'll intercept them in fourteen minutes.
 [Shran's Ready room]
 SHRAN: We've begun examining the weapon.
GENERAL [on viewscreen]: Excellent work. I'll see that you receive a
commendation.
SHRAN: With respect, General, I'd prefer you didn't.
GENERAL [on viewscreen]: Transmit your analysis as soon as possible.
TALAS [OC]: Commander Shran.
SHRAN: What is it?
TALAS [OC}: Enterprise is approaching.
 [IW Kumari Bridge]
 SHRAN: Where are they?
TALAS: Eighty thousand kilometres. They're hailing us.
SHRAN: Captain Archer. Glad to see you made it back safely. How did you
find us?
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: You don't think I'd let your people work on my
ship without appropriate supervision. Give us the weapon.
SHRAN: I respect your perseverance, but you don't actually think you'll
be able to take it from us?
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: No, I think you're going to give it to us.
Willingly.
SHRAN: (amused) I should have warned you. Don't drink too much of that
Andorian ale in one sitting.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: You tossed me overboard before I had a chance
to thank you for letting us access your sensor telemetry. When the
Xindi tested the weapon we were able to intercept their activation
codes. Give it to us, or we'll detonate it in your cargo bay.
SHRAN: You'll lose your prize.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: I'd rather do that than let you take it back to
Andoria.
SHRAN: Why? We're not your enemy.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: I can't take the chance that you'd use it
against the Vulcans.
SHRAN: What have the Vulcans done to deserve your loyalty?
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: You said you came to help us, Shran. You can
still make good on your offer.
SHRAN: I'm sorry, pinkskin.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: You're not giving me any choice.
SHRAN: I don't believe you. Take us into the anomaly field.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: T'Pol. (she works at her station, and Archer
smirks at Shran)
SHRAN: Shran to cargo hold three. What's your status?
ANDORIAN [OC]: The firing matrix has activated. I believe the device is
arming itself.
SHRAN: Shut it down.
ANDORIAN [OC]: We're trying, Commander.
ARCHER [on viewscreen]: I'd get rid of it while you still can.
SHRAN: Report!
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: They have less than thirty seconds.
ARCHER: Shran.
 [IW Kumari Bridge]
 T'POL [OC]: Twenty seconds.
SHRAN: Clear the hold. Prepare to open the bay doors.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Six seconds.
ARCHER: Let's get moving.
TRAVIS: Already on it, sir.
(The big bang catches the Kumari in its shockwave.)
REED: No damage sir.
ARCHER: The Andorians?
REED: They were much closer than we were. Their hull's intact but
there's significant damage to their engines and power systems.
ARCHER: Open a channel to Shran. Ask him if he requires our assistance.
 Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Commander Shran
graciously declined our offer of help. The last we saw of them, they
were limping away on auxiliary power.
 [Command centre]
 ARCHER: You have something?
HOSHI: Just before we went to warp we received a transmission from the
Andorian ship.
T'POL: It wasn't on one of their normal comm. frequencies. It was
encrypted to look like subspace interference.
ARCHER: Let's see it.
HOSHI: Apparently they had time to take some detailed scans while it
was aboard their ship.
T'POL: Judging by the clandestine nature of the transmission, I'd guess
that whoever sent this didn't want to be discovered.
ARCHER: Get it to Starfleet Command right away. (Hoshi leaves.) ARCHER: Why
don't you and Trip join me for dinner tonight. I have some Andorian ale
you might like to try.

 Mission date: Dec 12, 2153
Original Airdate: 1 Feb, 2004
  [Shuttle]
 (Degra wakes up on the floor of a small vessel.
He's dishevelled, his hair is long, and they are being attacked.)
DEGRA: who are you? (Archer is at the controls, also dishevelled with long hair.)
ARCHER: They're
targeting our engines.
DEGRA: What do you want with me?
ARCHER: You're the weapons expert. See if you can get those shields
back online. If we don't raise the shields, the only that's going to be
left of this ship is a cloud of vapour. (He pushes Degra aside and does it
himself. Degra looks out of the porthole.)
DEGRA: Insectoids!
ARCHER: These could be shield emitters. They're not going to last for
long.
DEGRA: Open a channel to those ships.
ARCHER: What?
DEGRA: They're Xindi. I'll order them to hold their fire.
ARCHER: It's been a long time since any Xindi took orders from you.
We're carrying five hundred litres of warp plasma in the starboard
tanks. We'll have to vent it. Turn these down on my mark. They're going
to destroy us. Now!
DEGRA: What happened?
ARCHER: The plasma got into their intake manifolds. Their engines are
overheating.
DEGRA: I want to know who you are. Why you've abducted me.
ARCHER: You really don't remember. I was afraid this might happen. It's
me, Archer.
DEGRA: What species are you?
ARCHER: You've been through a lot in the last two days. Just let me
figure out
DEGRA: What species!
ARCHER: I'm human. (Degra backs away as far as he can.)
DEGRA: You're from the Earth vessel.
ARCHER: Degra, you have to listen to me. I'm not your enemy anymore.
You've spent the last two days in an interrogation chamber. Whatever
the insectoids did to you in there must have affected your memory. My
name is Jonathan Archer. The two of us just escaped from an insectoid
prison colony.
DEGRA: Prison?
ARCHER: We've shared a cell for almost three years.
DEGRA: That's not possible.
ARCHER: Roll up your sleeves. (They have similar tattoos on their
forearms.) ARCHER: The conflict between our people is over. We both lost. I
promise I'll explain everything. Right now we have to get out of here
before our friends out there repair their engines.
DEGRA: What are you doing?
ARCHER: There's a system about a week from here. It's isolated. I doubt
they'll look for us there. (As the shuttle rattles to warp, Degra
stares in disbelief at his reflection in a porthole.)
DEGRA: You expect me to believe my own people would hold me prisoner?
You think that's amusing?
ARCHER: It's been a while since you referred to those overgrown
grasshoppers as your own people.
DEGRA: Why don't I remember you?
ARCHER: Probably because of the bloodworms.
DEGRA: Bloodworms?
ARCHER: They're used during interrogations. Their secretions act as a
truth serum, makes the prisoners more co-operative. But there's a side
effect. Sometimes they can suppress memories. The same thing happened
when they questioned me. I forgot everything that happened since flight
school. It'll start to come back to you. Give it a few days.
DEGRA: You claim that I've been a prisoner for three years.
ARCHER: Three years.
DEGRA: If that's true, why would they question me now?
ARCHER: They wanted information about the weapon.
DEGRA: What kind of information?
ARCHER: This is going to take some time. What's the last thing you
remember?
DEGRA: I was on my vessel, approaching the planet in the Calindra
system.
ARCHER: The weapons test. It failed because your prototype was
sabotaged.
DEGRA: How would you know that?
ARCHER: Because I'm responsible for it. Your kemocite shipment was
tampered with.
DEGRA: Gralik.
ARCHER: He wasn't too happy when I told him what you were planning to
do with his kemocite.
DEGRA: He'll be executed for this.
ARCHER: He was. In the end it didn't make much of a difference. We
didn't stop your programme, we only slowed it down. A few weeks later
the weapon was launched. It destroyed my planet.
DEGRA: We were successful?
ARCHER: I don't know if you'd call it a success. After Earth was
destroyed the old Xindi rivalries surfaced again. The insectoids
started attacking other Xindi colonies. They killed thousands of your
people.
DEGRA: The reptilians and aquatics would never allow that.
ARCHER: There wasn't a lot they could do. While you were busy
constructing the weapon, the insectoids were secretly building hundreds
of new ships. They used Earth as a diversion. Their real goal was to
dominate the other Xindi species. Are you all right? (Something moves
under the skin of Degra's forearm.) ARCHER: It's just a bloodworm. It'll work
its was out.
DEGRA: Can you remove it?
(Archer rummages in a couple of lockers and finds a knife and a glass
vial.)
ARCHER: Hold still. (Archer cuts into Degra's arm, pulls out the six inch
long worm and puts it in the vial. Putting things away again
afterwards, he finds a bottle of something.) ARCHER: I think you need this more
than I do. Suit yourself. (He takes a swig.)
DEGRA: I don't understand how a Xindi and a human could put aside their
differences so quickly.
ARCHER: Trust me, it didn't happen overnight. (He points at to scar on his
forehead.) ARCHER: You gave me this the first day we were locked up together.
The guards thought it would be entertaining to put us in the same cell.
They even placed wagers on who would survive the longest. I was in
pretty bad shape at the time so you were the odds-on favourite. Your
people killed everyone I ever cared about. I was going to make sure you
never walked out of that cell. For weeks we tried to kill each other. I
was lying in the infirmary when I finally asked myself, what was the
point. My world was gone, but so was yours. So I made a proposal. The
two of us would work together to get out of that place. Took us longer
than either one of us thought, but here we are.
DEGRA: I don't recognise this type of ship.
ARCHER: It's a Malosian cargo shuttle.
DEGRA: Malosian.
ARCHER: They're traders. They bring supplies to the prison a few times
a month. No weapons, but she's sturdy enough to get us where we're
going.
DEGRA: Perhaps we should set a course to your vessel. Is it still in
the Expanse?
ARCHER: Not exactly. When we were getting close to finding your weapon
the insectoids sent their ships after us. They boarded Enterprise and
took me prisoner, then they planted spatial charges around our warp
reactor. My crew was still aboard when they detonated them.
DEGRA: The insectoids were always the aggressive species, but I never
thought them capable of this. They destroyed everything the Council
worked for.
ARCHER: The Council?
DEGRA: It was formed when our planet was destroyed. It was created to
find a new home world for all Xindi. After years of searching we found
a few suitable locations, but as usual couldn't agree on a final
choice. Our plan for reunification was put aside when we learned of the
threat from Earth. I was ordered to begin designing the weapon. I
devoted years to it. I made so many sacrifices. So did my wife. Do I
know what happened to my family?
ARCHER: You told me you'd heard from Naara before you were sent to
prison. She and the children were safe. We have a ship now. We can look
for them.
DEGRA: They were on a colony near a red giant.
ARCHER: There's nothing in range. Do you remember the coordinates?
DEGRA: I doubt if there's anything left. It would have been one of the
first colonies to be attacked.
ARCHER: There may have been survivors.
DEGRA: It's too dangerous. Patrol ships are still looking for us. We
should find a refuge in case.
(There's a hiss, and green gas starts coming into the cabin.)
ARCHER: Reactor coolant. The conduit must have ruptured in the attack.
Take it. (The only oxygen mask.)
DEGRA: What about you?
ARCHER: You're the one with a family. You want to see them again? Try
to seal the rupture. I'll see if I can close off the coolant tanks.
(Archer collapses as Degra seals the gash with a mini welder. Once he's done
it, he shares the oxygen with Archer as the air clears. Later, as Degra sleeps, Archer gets a hypospray from its hiding place
and injects him.)
 [Command centre]
 ARCHER [on monitor]: T'Pol.
(She presses a button and the shuttle's doors open.)
 [Cargo Bay two]
 PHLOX: He should remain unconscious for at least
two hours.
TUCKER: The son of a bitch designed the weapon.
ARCHER: Keep an eye on him. Trip. 
 [Command centre]
 ARCHER: What have we got?
T'POL: There are seven red giants in this region, but they're spread
over approximately forty light years.
ARCHER: Can we scan them for a weapons facility?
T'POL: Not at this distance.
TUCKER: This red giant might be a red herring. He only told you his
family was living near one of these stars. We don't know that the
weapon is there.
ARCHER: Degra's a senior official. We know he's designing the weapon.
There's a chance he'd keep his family close by.
HOSHI: For a moment, I thought he was going to give you the
co-ordinates.
TUCKER: Too bad he didn't go for the Andorian ale. That would've
loosened him up.
T'POL: You appear to have gained his trust. Perhaps you should try a
more direct approach.
ARCHER: What do you mean?
T'POL: Ask him where the weapon is being constructed.
ARCHER: It's too risky. If he suspects something, we'll wind up right
back where we started. He'll tell me. I just need a little more time.
 Three Days Earlier
 Captain's starlog, December 12th, 2153. We've
returned to the site where the Xindi were testing the prototype weapon.
An analysis of the debris may tell us more about it.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: I'm picking up a ship at the edge of the
system.
T'POL: It's Xindi.
ARCHER: Why didn't we see it before?
T'POL: It may have been travelling through one of the subspace vortices
that they use. It's hull signature matches the Xindi ships that were
here two days ago.
REED: Captain, I'm reading three biosigns on board.
ARCHER: Have they seen us yet?
T'POL: I don't believe so.
 [Degra's ship]
 DEGRA: Set course for the inner moon. Stand by to
deploy the sensor drones. (The ship shudders.) DEGRA: What's that?
THALEN: Weapons fire.
DEGRA: From where?
THALEN: There's a ship closing. It's the human vessel.
DEGRA: You said there was no one in the system.
THALEN: They must have been hiding in the debris.
DEGRA: Contact the Council.
THALEN: They've disabled our subspace transceiver.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: They're making a run for it.
ARCHER: See what you can do about their engines. (Four phase cannon shots later.)
REED: They're not going anywhere, sir.
ARCHER: Hail them. (Hoshi opens the channel and nods.) ARCHER: Stand down and
prepare to be boarded.
 [Degra's ship]
 DEGRA: Thalen. (He does something to a computer
panel. Later, when the two ships are docked together.)
ARCHER: Anything?
T'POL: They were attempting to erase the computer core when we boarded
the ship. There's very little data left.
ARCHER: What about navigational logs?
T'POL: They've been deleted.
HOSHI: I may have something here, sir. I think these are fragments from
a personal file. There are parts of a letter from someone named Degra.
ARCHER: Does it mention the weapon?
HOSHI: No. There's a reference to a planet he visited recently, Azati
Prime.
ARCHER: Let me know what else you find.
(He goes over to Tucker studying the engines.)
TUCKER: I'd love to spend an afternoon taking this engine apart.
ARCHER: Not your typical nacelle configuration?
TUCKER: Look how everything's tied in through their main deflector.
ARCHER: Learn everything you can.
 [Brig]
 (Archer activates the intercom.)
ARCHER: I want to know where you're building the weapon.
DEGRA: I don't know what you're talking about.
ARCHER: The hell you don't. Your name is Degra. I was at the Xindi
colony when you picked up your shipment of kemocite. Your people are
planning another attack. I'm not going to let that happen.
DEGRA: By capturing us, you've accomplished nothing.
ARCHER: Where's the weapon? (The power fluctuates.) ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge.
Report.
 [Bridge]
 REED: There's a surge in the plasma network.
ARCHER [OC]: What's causing it?
TRAVIS: Radiation from the debris field. It's starting to affect our
systems.
REED: Sir, I recommend putting a safe distance between us and the test
site.
ARCHER: All right. Take the ship out of the field but keep us close by.
REED: Understood.
 [Brig]
 ARCHER: If you won't tell me what I need to know,
perhaps one of your men will.
DEGRA: When my superiors learn we're missing, they'll find your ship
and destroy it.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: I could make a truth serum, but it could
take weeks to synthesise the correct formula. I've been studying Xindi
neuro-physiology. It may be possible to erase his most recent memory
engrams. That way Degra will never know that he came aboard, or that he
met any of us.
ARCHER: But this is a Xindi reptilian. Would it work on a primate?
PHLOX: Their neural pathways are virtually identical. I'll need to
perform a few tests, but I don't expect it will be a problem.
ARCHER: How selective could this memory wipe be?
 [Situation room]
 TUCKER: I've built flight simulators for Starfleet
training. This wouldn't be that different.
REED: It's not simply a matter of constructing a shuttle, it has to be
designed. What species built it, what language would the control
interface use.
ARCHER: Hoshi can help with that.
HOSHI: I've recovered a letter Degra wrote to his wife a few months
ago. Her name's Naara. They have two children.
T'POL: It may be necessary to communicate with you while you're inside
the simulator.
REED: The MACOs use subdermal transceivers.
PHLOX: They're relatively easy to implant.
ARCHER: Let's get started. (The meeting adjourns.) ARCHER: T'Pol, I could use
your help with some of the details.
T'POL: Details?
ARCHER: If he buys into this, Degra's going to want to know everything
that's happened in the last three years. I can't make up the whole
story on the spot.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: Nice work. (Phlox is making Degra's tattoo.)
PHLOX: Thank you. Dermal art used to be very
common on Denobula. Fortunately, my parents insisted I study it. I've
also stimulated his hair follicles.
ARCHER: I'm not sure about the grey. This is only supposed to be three
years from now.
PHLOX: Ah, but you're forgetting about the stress of imprisonment and
torture. It could very well have an effect on hair pigmentation.
(He fetches a jar from the counter.)
ARCHER: You're sure these are safe?
PHLOX: Oh, yes. I've treated patients with Regulan bloodworms for
years. There should be no side-effects aside from a thoroughly cleansed
lymphatic system. Please try not to injure it. They're difficult to
replace.
ARCHER: I'll do my best.
 [Shuttle]
 DEGRA: What is it?
ARCHER: Spatial anomalies. We're passing through a field of them. Hold
on.
 [Command centre]
 (The scene in the shuttle is on a monitor.)
T'POL: T'Pol to Cargo Bay two.
 [Cargo Bay two]
 T'POL [OC]: Increase hydraulics to level six.
 [Shuttle]
 DEGRA: Is the hull lined with trellium?
ARCHER: Obviously not.
 [Command centre]
 T'POL: Increase to level seven.
 [Cargo Bay two]
 T'POL [OC]: On my mark, initiate a sharp jolt to
starboard.
TUCKER: How sharp
 [Command centre]
 TUCKER [OC]: do you want it?
T'POL: Sharp.
 [Cargo Bay two]
 TUCKER: You heard the lady.
 [Command centre]
 T'POL: Let the Captain know.
HOSHI: This is going to be a rough one, sir.
 [Shuttle]
 (It is, and Degra falls over while Archer nearly
falls out of his seat.)
ARCHER: We're losing structural integrity. I'm taking us out of warp.
We'll never make it through this field in one piece.
DEGRA: Can we go around?
ARCHER: We don't have enough fuel. We should send a distress call. One
of your ships might be close enough to hear it.
DEGRA: What if the insectoids pick it up?
ARCHER: We don't have a lot of choices.
DEGRA: There's a comm. channel used by high-ranking primate officials.
I doubt the insectoids know it.
ARCHER: What's the frequency?
DEGRA: It would be easier for me to enter it directly.
(Archer transfers communications to another panel, and lets Degra be
secretive about his frequency.)
 [Command centre]
 T'POL: Ensign?
HOSHI: I've got it.
T'POL: Stand by to respond.
REED [OC]: Bridge to Command centre.
T'POL: Go ahead.
 [Bridge]
 REED: I'm picking up a distortion in subspace. I
believe it's a Xindi ship.
 [Command centre]
 T'POL: How long until they arrive?
 [Bridge]
 REED: About six hours.
 [Command centre]
 HOSHI: Their sensors are pretty sophisticated.
They might see us long before then.
T'POL: Lieutenant, take us back into the debris field.
REED [OC]: The radiation could overload our systems again.
T'POL: I'm aware of the risks. Carry out my orders.
REED [OC]: Acknowledged.
 [Shuttle]
 ARCHER: One of the inmates told me all about
Maarek Three. He used it as a staging area when he was smuggling
dilithium. (Degra shares the Andorian ale.)
DEGRA: What did he say it was like?
ARCHER: Beautiful, with beaches that go on for thousands of kilometres.
First thing I'm going to do is find a cold lake and take the longest
bath of my life.
 [Command centre]
 ARCHER [on monitor]: It sounded a lot like Earth,
the way he described it.
HOSHI: The Captain's certainly drinking a lot.
T'POL: The Doctor gave him an anti-intoxicant.
ARCHER [on monitor]: This colony of yours, you never told me about it.
DEGRA [on monitor]: It was bleak, desolate.
 [Shuttle]
 DEGRA: The planet was barely habitable.
ARCHER: Why'd you live there?
DEGRA: It wasn't by choice. Naara was desperate to leave, she didn't
think a military habitat was the right environment for the children. Do
you have a family, Captain?
ARCHER: It's been a long time since anyone called me Captain. It's
Jonathan, remember? I never really had an opportunity to start one. I
was away from home a lot.
DEGRA: You should make the time. I've learned that our work, in the
end, means very little. Our real legacy is the children. I would do
anything to protect mine. After I was told of the threat from humanity
I left my theoretical studies and agreed to design the prototype
weapon. When it arrived in your star system, I watched the incoming
telemetry with the other members of the Council. Seven million lives
were extinguished in front of my eyes. I asked myself how many of those
were children. I suppose I've told you this before.
ARCHER: Actually, you haven't.
DEGRA: Three years. My children may not even recognise me after so
much.
ARCHER: We're being hailed. Whoever it is, they must be pretty far
away. I'll try to clear it up.
THALEN [OC]: Transmission. This is Thalen responding to your distress
call. Please acknowledge.
DEGRA: It's one of my colleagues. (He opens a channel.) DEGRA: Thalen, can you
hear me? It's Degra.
THALEN [OC]: Degra? It's good to hear your voice. I'd heard from my
sources
 [Command centre]
 HOSHI: That you'd been captured by the insectoids.
There were reports that you had been executed.
DEGRA [OC]: They haven't killed me yet. I need your help. My friend and
I
 [Shuttle]
 DEGRA: Have escaped from an Insectoid prison.
Their patrols are looking for us.
THALEN [OC]: I'm losing your signal. Please repeat.
ARCHER: Better make it fast.
DEGRA: Thalen, where are you?
THALEN [OC]: I'm on Azati Prime. It's safe here.
DEGRA: Is my family still there, are they safe? Thalen!
THALEN [OC]: Naara is here, and the children. I'll tell them to expect
you. (Fades into gibberish.)
ARCHER: At least you know they're all right.
DEGRA: There were more than a thousand primates and arboreals at that
colony. I don't understand why it wasn't destroyed.
 [Command centre]
 ARCHER [on monitor]: We should still change
course. Do you know the coordinates? What's wrong?
DEGRA: You must forgive me. To me, it's been only a day since we were
enemies. Giving you the coordinates to a classified installation is
difficult.
ARCHER: Be my guest.
 [Command centre]
 HOSHI: They're coming in. One one two seven point
four by four zero five two by three nine zero one point one.
T'POL: A red giant. Open a comm. line to the Captain.
ARCHER [on monitor]: You encrypted the navigation controls.
 [Shuttle]
 DEGRA: Yes.
T'POL [OC]: Captain, the coordinates match the location of one of the
red giants.
ARCHER: Do you mind if I ask how long it will take to get there?
DEGRA: Not long.
T'POL [OC]: Approximately three weeks at maximum warp.
 [Command centre]
 T'POL: A considerable detour if the weapon isn't
there.
(Archer taps a control, and the words Stand By come up on the main
monito.r)
 [Shuttle]
 ARCHER: What will your people think when you show
up with me. Humans probably aren't their favourite species.
DEGRA: I'll tell them everything you did to help me. I'm a senior
official. There won't be any problems.
ARCHER: I appreciate that.
DEGRA: It's a diverse community. Far more pleasant than most military
(The ship rattles.)
 [Cargo Bay two]
 TUCKER: Travis?
TRAVIS: The port hydraulics are acting up.
TUCKER: Shut them down.
TRAVIS: They're not responding.
T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Cargo Bay two. Report.
TUCKER: The radiation from the debris is
 [Command centre]
 TUCKER [OC]: Overloading the hydraulic system.
T'POL: Can you stabilise the simulator?
TUCKER [OC]: I'm working on it.
 [Shuttle]
 DEGRA: More anomalies?
ARCHER: I'm not sure.
 [Command centre]
 T'POL: Captain, we're having some problems. Stand
by. T'Pol to the Bridge. Take us out of the debris field.
REED [OC]: Understood. (Degra sees something out of the porthole.)
REED [OC]: Bridge to the Command centre. We're clear of the debris field.
T'POL: Acknowledged.
 [Shuttle]
 DEGRA: What was the problem?
ARCHER: Subspace turbulence.
DEGRA: Really. I'm curious, Jonathan. If we've been friends for as long
as you say, I must have told you the names of my children.
 [Command centre]
 ARCHER [on monitor]: You still don't believe me,
do you.
HOSHI: There's something in his hand.
DEGRA [on monitor]: I'm sure I would have told you
T'POL: Magnify.
ARCHER [on monitor]: It's been years since you've said anything.
T'POL: Captain, he has a weapon.
 [Shuttle]
 DEGRA: I just need you to tell me.
 [Command centre]
 DEGRA [on monitor]: What their names are.
T'POL: We're coming in.
ARCHER [on monitor]: This isn't necessary.
HOSHI: Piral and Jaina.
 [Shuttle]
 ARCHER: Piral and Jaina.
DEGRA: Which one is older.
 [Command centre]
 HOSHI: It's not in here, sir.
 [Shuttle]
 (They fight, Archer gets cut but overpowers Degra
just as Tucker, Travis and the MACO burst in.)
DEGRA: You'll never find the weapon.
ARCHER: Take him to the Brig.
 [Brig]
 DEGRA: We were told humans were ruthless, but I
didn't know you were also skilled at deception. (Archer is cleaned up and back in uniform.)
ARCHER: When did you realise.
DEGRA: I had my suspicions from the beginning, but it was the comm.
signal from my colleague on Azati Prime that confirmed them.
ARCHER: We know your ship has been there, recently.
DEGRA: There's an Insectoid deuterium facility on Azati Prime. That's
the last place my people would have gone to hide from them. If it
weren't for that one mistake, your plan might have succeeded.
ARCHER: You gave us the coordinates of a red giant.
DEGRA: I gave you what you thought you wanted.
ARCHER: I guess I'll just have to wipe your memory clean again, go back
into the simulator and start this whole thing over.
DEGRA: I doubt there's time for that. We both know my people are
searching for me.
ARCHER: I think you didn't figure it out until after the malfunction.
I'd be willing to bet those co-ordinates are real.
DEGRA: Then I suggest you proceed there at maximum warp.
 [Command centre]
 HOSHI: Why would he encrypt the coordinates if
they weren't accurate?
T'POL: Perhaps he thought it would make them appear more convincing.
TUCKER: He's got to be lying, sir. Something must have happened during
the radiation surge that tipped him off.
ARCHER: We can't afford to lose three weeks if the weapon isn't there.
Have you learned anything more about how they open the subspace
vortices?
TUCKER: They use some kind of phase deflector pulses. Once they're in,
their ships can travel half a dozen light years in a couple of minutes.
ARCHER: I want to see all the data you've collected.
 [Engineering]
 ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: We're ready.
T'POL: Tactical alert. Engage. (Everything starts to shake.)
 [Brig]
 REED: Open it.
SECURITY: Sir.
REED: You two, come with me. I said move! (He drags Degra and Thalen out.)
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: We'll fracture the hull if this goes on
any longer.
(Reed comes in with his two prisoners.)
T'POL [OC]: Hull breaches on decks D and E.
ARCHER: Emergency bulkheads! You're the engineer?
THALEN: Yes.
ARCHER: You're going to help us. We adapted your technology, used our
main deflector to open a subspace vortex.
DEGRA: That's impossible.
TUCKER: The vortex is starting to collapse. I need you to stabilise it.
ARCHER: If you don't do what he says, this ship will break apart.
Lieutenant. (Archer takes the phase pistol off Reed and holds it to Degra's neck.)
ARCHER: Tell him to do what he's told.
DEGRA: Do nothing to help them.
TUCKER: The pylons are buckling.
(Flames come shooting up the inter-deck lift.)
T'POL [OC]: Engineering, we're losing hull integrity. (The shaking stops.)
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: It wasn't me, Captain. (He checks his monitor.) TUCKER: I'll be damned.
Travis inverted the warp field. It dropped us back into normal space.
T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: Please report to the Bridge.
ARCHER: Take him back to the Brig. (Thalen is taken off, Degra goes
with Archer.)
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Report.
T'POL: We've reached the coordinates. Ensign, magnify.
(A red giant sun glowers on the viewscreen.)
REED: I'm picking up several Xindi vessels. I'm also reading
significant quantities of kemocite.
ARCHER: What's our status?
REED: Minimal damage. The hull plating's coming back online.
ARCHER: Arm all weapons. Lay in a course for those kemocite signatures,
full impulse. Get him out of here.
DEGRA: You'll never get close to the weapon! Our defence perimeter will
destroy you!
ARCHER: Show him. (The viewscreen switches from red giant to weapons
testing asteroid.) ARCHER: Thanks for your help. Take him to Sickbay. (A MACO
takes Degra out.) ARCHER: I think you overdid the turbulence just a little,
Ensign.
TRAVIS: I'll try to do better next time, sir.
 [Degra's ship]
 (The unconscious crew are being placed in their
seats.)
ARCHER: How's it coming?
T'POL: We've made it appear as if a plasma conduit ruptured, rendering
them unconscious.
PHLOX: I'm injecting them with trace amounts of the plasma. It won't be
harmful.
T'POL: This accident won't explain how their computer core was deleted.
ARCHER: As long as they don't know we were here, we can leave them with
a mystery. (into communicator) Go ahead.
REED [OC]: The Xindi vessel's less than an hour away, sir.
 Captain's starlog, supplemental. Hopefully the
journey to Azati Prime will be the final leg in our search for the
Xindi weapon.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Harbinger
Harbinger
 Mission date: Dec 27, 2153
Original Airdate: 11 Feb, 2004
 
T'POL [OC]: Previously on Enterprise.
ARCHER [Command
centre] : Whoever built these Spheres may have done it to
create the Expanse.
T'POL: Why would someone want to create a web of crippling anomalies?
D'JAMAT [Captain's mess]: We
believe that it is through prayer and meditation that the Makers become
manifest.
ARCHER: The Makers?
D'JAMAT: The creators of the Spheres.
HAYES [Mess Hall]: The
quicker you folks find these Xindi, the quicker we can get to work.
HOSHI: Military Assault Command.
HAYES: Captain Archer wanted the best.
REED [Armoury]: I've
seen men like Hayes all my life.
T'POL: Lieutenant?
REED: That had nothing to do with who knows Enterprise inside and out.
It had to do with who the Major thinks is more capable of carrying out
this rescue.
DEGRA [Shuttle]: It's
only been a day since we were enemies.
DEGRA [Command centre] [on
monitor]: Giving you the coordinates to a classified installation is
difficult.
HOSHI: They're coming in.
T'POL: The coordinates match the location of one of the red giants.
ARCHER [Engineering]: Doctor
Phlox says we have to prepare for the possibility that Trip won't
survive.
PHLOX [Sickbay]: When
implanted with DNA from another species, it exactly replicates that
species' lifecycle.
ARCHER: It becomes a clone.
SIM [T'Pol's quarters]:
You and Trip used to spend a lot of time here together.
T'POL: I was instructing him in the practice of Vulcan neuro-pressure.
SIM: He was really starting to enjoy those sessions with you. What's
driving me crazy is I don't know if these feelings are mine or his.
 [Tucker's quarters]
 (It's a neuro-pressure session, and he is working
on her foot.)
TUCKER: Malcolm can be a tough man to get to know, I'll grant you that.
He likes to keep to himself. This feel okay?
(He presses a point on her foot.)
TUCKER: But, you spend enough time around him, you come to realise
there's no one you'd rather have watching your back.
(She pulls her foot away.)
TUCKER: I thought you said you weren't ticklish.
COLE: I didn't used to be.
TUCKER: Maybe I'm doing this wrong.
COLE: Maybe we should try another position.
TUCKER: Posture? Sure. Take a seat.
COLE: I just get the feeling whenever Lieutenant Reed looks at one of
us, he sees the enemy.
TUCKER: I don't think Malcolm thinks of MACOs as the enemy. Competition
maybe. Relax.
(He puts his thumbs by her spine.)
TUCKER: This is one of the first pressure points T'Pol worked on.
Helped me get through many a night.
COLE: Feels great. Too bad this can't be a part of our training
routine.
TUCKER: You should bring it up with Hayes.
COLE: His training regimen hasn't changed since I joined up. Major
Hayes likes consistency.
TUCKER: So does Malcolm. He told me that while he was in Starfleet
training, he ate the exact same three meals every day for a year.
COLE: They're definitely cut from the same cloth.
TUCKER: Maybe that's why they get along so well. (pressing harder)
How's it feeling?
COLE: Still great.
TUCKER: There.
(He lets go. Cole turns
around and faces him.)
COLE: feel like I've just had twelve hours sleep.
TUCKER: Well I guess I did it right.
(She kisses him.)
TUCKER: Well.
COLE: Well.
TUCKER: That was unexpected.
COLE: Nothing wrong with unexpected.
TUCKER: No. With a little warning.
COLE: Consider that a little warning for next time.
(She leaves him grinning like an idiot.)
 Captain's starlog, December 27th, 2153. Using the
coordinates we got from Degra, we're en route to the location of the
red giant star and with any luck, the Xindi weapon.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in.
REED: You wanted to see me, sir.
ARCHER: I had a conversation with Major Hayes this morning. He wants to
put your security team and all the senior officers through a series of
training drills.
REED: We run drills twice a week. Senior officers are free to attend.
ARCHER: These would be different. They'd be conducted by Major Hayes
and the MACOs.
REED: Sir?
ARCHER: We're heading into a hostile situation. We don't know what
we're going to face when we get there.
REED: My people are ready, sir.
ARCHER: The MACOs' tactics and technology are two, three years beyond
Starfleet's. Why not let them pass on some of that expertise? You don't
agree.
REED: The MACOs' expertise comes from simulated combat, all conducted
on Earth. On the other hand, we've fought numerous alien species on
many different worlds. If anything, we should be giving the MACOs the
benefit of our experience.
ARCHER: Hayes and his men have gone up against a few aliens on this
mission, including the Xindi. They've handled themselves pretty well.
I'd like you to co-ordinate the training sessions with the Major.
REED: Aye, sir.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: Ah, I appreciate your stopping by so
quickly.
T'POL: What did you want to ask me.
PHLOX: Are you acquainted with Corporal Amanda Cole?
T'POL: She's one of the MACOs.
PHLOX: She was in this morning with a mild headache. Says she's been
experiencing it for a week now. Every test I ran came back negative.
Frankly, I was mystified until she mentioned she was receiving Vulcan
neuro-pressure from Commander Tucker.
T'POL: You believe it's causing her headaches?
PHLOX: Well, I wanted to ask you. Neuro-pressure's a highly specialised
discipline. Commander Tucker's only be receiving it for a couple of
months. I thought it was possible that he might have misapplied one of
it's techniques.
T'POL: It's possible.
PHLOX: Well, I've already spoken to Corporal Cole about using caution,
but I was wondering if you might have a word with Commander Tucker.
Perhaps during your next session with him?
T'POL: Gladly.
PHLOX: Everything all right?
T'POL: Yes. If there's nothing else.
PHLOX: Oh, there is one other thing. If you find time, perhaps you
could schedule a neuro-pressure session with Corporal Cole. Maybe undo
some of Commander Tucker's work.
 [Corridor]
 HAYES: Okay, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday. How does
oh eight hundred sound.
REED: I prefer to train in the evenings.
HAYES: Any reason?
REED: You get a better workout. Muscles are looser, reaction times
quicker.
HAYES: How about Tuesdays and Fridays in the morning, Wednesdays in the
evening.
REED: How about Tuesdays and Fridays in the evenings, and Wednesday in
the morning.
HAYES: You're not making this very easy.
REED: I'm not trying to make it difficult.
HAYES: With all due respect, I think that's exactly what you're trying
to do.
REED: With all due respect? Is that what you call circumventing my
authority?
HAYES: I wasn't aware I'd done that.
REED: And what did you think you were doing when you went to the
Captain with this proposal?
HAYES: If I'd come to you first you'd have turned me down flat.
REED: You're probably right, but the decision was mine to make.
HAYES: I didn't mean to deprive you of the opportunity.
REED: I think that's exactly what you meant to do.
HAYES: Whatever you might think, sir, my only concern is the successful
outcome of this mission.
REED: As is mine. Tuesdays and Fridays, in the evenings.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: What's the problem.
TRAVIS: I can't understand it, Captain. It's like the stars keep
shifting positions.
ARCHER: What do you mean?
TRAVIS: There, they just did it again.
ARCHER: Maybe it's one of the navigational sensors.
TRAVIS: I've already run two diagnostics. I can't find anything wrong.
T'POL: I think I have the cause. An unusually strong gravimetric
disturbance approximately three light years away.
ARCHER: Let's go take a look.
(They arrive at an orangey brown bubbly gloop anomaly.)
T'POL: It appears to be a convergence of spatial anomalies.
REED: It's more than seven hundred million kilometres in diameter.
HOSHI: Captain, I'm picking up an intermittent signal. Very faint.
T'POL: An object, approximately five metres in length.
ARCHER: Let's see it.
(There in the gloop is an escape pod or something similar.)
T'POL: It's just a few hundred metres from the edge. I'm reading one
biosign. Humanoid.
REED: Could be an escape pod.
ARCHER: Are there any other ships in the vicinity?
T'POL: None. The biosigns are very erratic.
ARCHER: Bring the grappler online.
(It misses because the gloop slows and deflects it.)
ARCHER: Try again.
REED: I'll see if I can compensate.
(It gets the pod, but orange whatever surges out and over the hull.)
ARCHER: Travis.
(The air goes purple and the Bridge fills with sparkly things and gas.
Consoles go bang.)
REED: We're losing systems all over the ship.
TRAVIS: Helm's not responding.
T'POL: There are rising levels on ammonium sulphide in the atmosphere.
ARCHER: Archer to Engineering.
TUCKER [OC]: Commander Tucker.
ARCHER: The helm's not responding. We need full reverse
 [Engineering]
 (The atmosphere here is clean.)
ARCHER [OC]: Right away.
TUCKER: I'm on it.
 [Bridge]
 (A jolt backwards out of the gloop, the air clears
and the sparkly things disappear.)
TRAVIS: Helm's back online.
ARCHER: Get us out of here.
TRAVIS: Love to.
 [Launch bay]
 TUCKER: We're ready to open the hatch.
(He and Malcolm remove the front of the pod. Vapour pours out, and a
body in a clear tube is ejected.)
 [Sickbay]
 (The alien is awake and shaking. He looks as if he
has a bad case of icthyosis.)
PHLOX: He's suffering from a form of rapid cellular degeneration.
ARCHER: Do you think you can stop it?
PHLOX: I don't know yet. I've managed to revive him, but he's in a fair
amount of pain.
ARCHER: (goes to the biobed) I'm Captain Archer.
ALIEN: You had no right to bring me here.
PHLOX: We were trying to save your life.
ALIEN: I didn't ask for your help. Return me to my ship.
ARCHER: Your vessel has minimal life support. You wouldn't last too
long if we took you back.
ALIEN: That's none of your concern.
ARCHER: What was that pod designed to do?
ALIEN: I'm not answering any of your questions.
ARCHER: You're dying. We're doing everything we can for you, but
ALIEN: Take me back to my ship!
PHLOX: He may be going into shock.
 [Command centre]
 ARCHER: How's it coming?
TRAVIS: Good, sir. We're adjusting the nav sensors to compensate for
the gravimetric waves.
ARCHER: Get us underway as soon as you can.
TRAVIS: Just need a day to upload and test these corrections.
(Travis leaves.)
ARCHER: Learn anything?
T'POL: A great deal. The disturbance appears to be expanding at a rate
of several kilometres per second, and it's location is exactly
equidistant to five of the Spheres.
ARCHER: Do you think the Spheres have something to do with creating
this thing?
T'POL: It's possible. This planet was once an inhabited world. It was
engulfed some time ago. I couldn't find any signs of life.
ARCHER: Maybe the alien we picked up is the last survivor.
T'POL: A possibility.
ARCHER: I want you and Trip to take a look at the pod. If we can't
revive the alien, it may be our best source of information.
 [Cargo bay]
(Hayes is giving a martial arts demonstration.)
 HAYES: We incorporate elements from numerous
disciplines. It's extremely effective in hand to hand situations. What
I'd like to do now is break up into sparring pairs, run through some of
the moves you just saw. Let's get started.
(Tucker pairs up with Cole, the other senior staff with other MACOs,
T'Pol is watching Tucker get his bottom slapped when she gets floored
by a simple punch.)
HAYES: Try the combination. Nice cross.
(Travis floors his opponent every time.)
HAYES: Excellent. Effective combination.
(The tables are turned, Travis gets slammed against the floor and
bloodied.)
HAYES: You were looking at his hands when you should have been watching
his eyes.
TRAVIS: Good match.
(He shakes his opponent's hand,)
HAYES: All right, why don't we take five minutes
REED: That's all for today.
HAYES: We still have the shoulder throws to cover.
REED: Session is over.
HAYES: Okay. For next time, work on your forearm blocks, and the elbow
strikes.
REED: Dismissed.
(The rest leave.)
REED: What the hell was that.
HAYES: That was a sparring demonstration.
REED: It was way out of line. That last throw was completely
unnecessary.
HAYES: He was on his feet. That made him fair game.
REED: Fair game.
HAYES: It's just a little blood, sir. No one got hurt.
REED: These are training sessions, Major. If your men can't understand
that then I'm going to put a stop to this right now. Is that clear?
HAYES: Perfectly.
REED: Jolly good.
 [Launch bay]
 TUCKER: I think it's a transmitter. I just can't
pin-point the frequency.
T'POL: Doctor Phlox has asked me to speak with you.
TUCKER: What about?
T'POL: Corporal Cole's been experiencing headaches. The Doctor believes
they might be caused by your neuro-pressure sessions.
TUCKER: She never said anything about headaches.
T'POL: Perhaps she didn't want to worry you.
TUCKER: Why would neuro-pressure be the cause?
T'POL: It shouldn't be performed by novices. If misapplied, you could
cause nerve damage.
TUCKER: I've performed it on you plenty of times.
T'POL: Under my supervision.
TUCKER: I see. You want to supervise me and Corporal Cole?
T'POL: I think it would simply be best if you ended the sessions. These
electrodes were collecting biometric data from the occupant.
TUCKER: Amanda won't be too happy about ending the sessions.
T'POL: I'm sure she won't.
TUCKER: What do you mean by that?
T'POL: I've noticed that you and Corporal Cole have become somewhat
friendly.
TUCKER: Friendly.
T'POL: Last week you were eating together in the mess hall, and in the
training session yesterday she touched your behind.
TUCKER: You've been keeping a pretty close eye on us.
T'POL: You're hard to miss.
TUCKER: Look, Amanda and I just share a lot of interests, that's all.
We both come from Florida
T'POL: There's no reason to justify your behaviour. I was simply
suggesting you might use some discretion.
TUCKER: Discretion.
T'POL: It's not appropriate for a senior officer to fraternise with a
subordinate.
TUCKER: She's not Starfleet. There's nothing inappropriate about it.
What's wrong?
T'POL: We need to get this data to the Captain immediately.
 [Ready room]
 T'POL: There's no mistake. The pod's hull contains
the exact combination of alloys we found on the surface of the Spheres.
ARCHER: You remember the Triannon creation myth?
T'POL: They believed the Spheres were created by divine beings who will
one day return to the Chosen Realm.
ARCHER: And that the Spheres were reshaping the Expanse into a paradise
for the faithful.
T'POL: Perhaps Triannon mythology has a basis in fact. It appears the
pod was designed to transmit data regarding the alien's physiological
status. I believe he was inserted into the disturbance so someone could
monitor his exposure to the environment.
ARCHER: A canary. On Earth, miners used to take canaries into the
tunnels with them. If the canary didn't die, the miners knew the air
would be safe to breathe, and they could proceed.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: His condition has worsened. He's literally
disintegrating and there doesn't seem to be any way to stop it.
ARCHER: I want to talk to him again.
PHLOX: I don't even know if I can revive him.
ARCHER: Find a way.
PHLOX: Captain, this man is dying a painful death. To keep him
conscious is unethical.
ARCHER: Until I get the answers I need, we're going to have to bend a
few ethics.
PHLOX: Very well, I'll do what I can.
ARCHER: Notify me when he's conscious.
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 T'POL: Corporal. Come in.
COLE: Thank you, ma'am. I appreciate your doing this.
T'POL: Please sit down. Remove your jacket. I assume Commander Tucker
briefed you on the proper breathing technique.
COLE: He did.
T'POL: Begin with a deep breath. Good. Doctor Phlox did caution you
against any further neuro-pressure from Commander Tucker?
COLE: I got the lecture.
(T'Pol works from Cole's neck to her shoulders.)
T'POL: You and Commander Tucker appear to enjoy each others
company.
COLE: We do have a lot in common. Did he tell you we grew up less than
fifty kilometres from each other?
T'POL: He didn't mention it.
COLE: Our high school's were rivals, we went to the same movie
theatres. What are the odds?
T'POL: Extremely low.
COLE: Unfortunately, neither of our home towns exists any more. They
were both destroyed in the attack.
T'POL: Did you lose any relatives?
COLE: My family moved up north a few years ago. I was lucky.
T'POL: Commander Tucker was greatly affected by his sister's death.
COLE: He talks about her a lot.
T'POL: You're quite fond of him.
COLE: What's not to like. He's a gentleman, he's great to be around,
and he has very nice arms. Ow.
(T'Pol is working down the spine.)
T'POL: I apologise. I'll try not to press so hard.
 [Armoury]
 (There's a device on the wall, a console in a
corner, and a mark on the floor. The group are gathered around.)
HAYES: We developed this specialised training system at Jupiter Station
a few months ago. The goal is to hit as many targets as you can in ten
seconds. Lieutenant, if you're up for it. Fall back. Start him off at
level two.
(Holographic target balls come flying around as Reed takes pot shots at
them.)
HAYES: Four targets in ten seconds. Not bad for a first go, but you
might schedule a little extra practice time. Kick it up to level four.
(Hayes takes his own turn.)
HAYES: Nine hits. That's a mid-range score. Corporal Cole here has the
record, fourteen hits at level four.
COLE: I was having a lucky day.
HAYES: Okay, lets do some shooting. We'll start at level two and work
our way up. Who'd like to go next?
(Tucker steps forward.)
 [Mess hall]
 TUCKER: That target practice was something. Sure
looked a easier than it was.
REED: You don't say.
TUCKER: Oh, come on. Your score got a lot better as the session went
on.
REED: I started picturing Hayes' head in place of the target.
TUCKER: You two really ought to declare a truce.
REED: Oh, no. This is a fight to the death.
TUCKER: I guess if I were in your shoes, I'd be just as upset.
REED: He's determined to take over the security of this ship, you know.
TUCKER: You really believe that?
REED: Everything he does points to the fact.
TUCKER: Well, it could also be that he wants everyone to be as prepared
as possible. You have to admit the extra training isn't such a bad
idea.
REED: Just drop it.
TUCKER: Okay.
REED: So, why don't you tell me about you and Miss Cole?
TUCKER: We're friends. Is everyone on this ship watching us?
REED: You're pretty hard to miss.
TUCKER: That's what T'Pol said.
REED: Is it true she's giving Amanda neuro-pressure now?
TUCKER: So?
REED: I heard it was damage control from your tender touch.
TUCKER: T'Pol's just smoothing out some of the rough spots. That's all.
REED: And why were you giving Amanda Cole neuro-pressure anyway?
TUCKER: What's it to you?
REED: Well, from what I'm told, it's a pretty intimate procedure, for
just friends.
TUCKER: I do it with T'Pol. Are you implying there's something going on
there as well?
REED: That's the rumour.
TUCKER: Look, for the last time, there's nothing going on with any of
us, between any of us.
REED: Right. You're all just friends.
TUCKER: That's right.
REED: I guess this Vulcan neuro-pressure isn't that intimate after all.
TUCKER: Exactly.
REED: In that case, I've got a nasty little pain just
TUCKER: Just drop it.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: We know you were sent here as some kind of
test subject. The region of space where we found you. What is it?
PHLOX: His pain medication's wearing off.
ARCHER: Hold off a second.
PHLOX: Captain.
ALIEN: I was sent against my will. I am not from your part of space. I
come from a trans-dimensional realm.
ARCHER: Keep going.
ALIEN: I don't know why I was sent here.
ARCHER: I find that hard to believe.
ALIEN: It's the truth. I was a prisoner. Because of my transgressions,
I've spent my entire adult life inside a cell. One day the guards
offered me freedom if I would participate in an experiment. I agreed.
That's all I remember before I woke up here.
ARCHER: We found you drifting in a pod, hooked up to banks of
monitoring equipment. You're telling me you have no idea why?
ALIEN: The experiment was important to them. They wouldn't abandon me.
Take me back.
ARCHER: That's impossible.
ALIEN: If you don't, I'll die. Please. (his hand disappears and
reappears) What's happening to me? What's happening to me?
 Captain's starlog, supplemental. With Travis's
adjustments in place, we've resumed course for the red giant.
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 TUCKER: Between all this training and the extra
shifts in Engineering, I've been looking forward to this all day.
T'POL: Sit up.
TUCKER: You aren't saying much tonight. Don't tell me you're still
upset about me and Amanda.
T'POL: I'm not upset.
TUCKER: It sure sounds like it.
T'POL: You're mistaken.
TUCKER: Why would a few neuro-pressure sessions between me and a MACO
be such a big deal? Unless.
T'POL: Unless what?
TUCKER: Unless you're a little jealous.
T'POL: I don't experience jealousy.
TUCKER: You're doing a pretty fair imitation of it.
T'POL: I am not, in any way, jealous of you and Corporal Cole.
TUCKER: You know, your voice is tensing up. It's a dead giveaway.
T'POL: I didn't know you were an expert in vocal inflections.
TUCKER: I don't need to be an expert to read you. Come on, admit it.
You're a little jealous.
T'POL: You're implying that I'm attracted to you.
TUCKER: That kind of goes along with the assumption, doesn't it?
T'POL: I think you're mistaken about who's attracted to whom.
TUCKER: Are you saying I'm attracted to you?
T'POL: I don't need to say it. You already have.
TUCKER: I don't remember that conversation.
T'POL: It wasn't you, it was your clone. Sim told me.
TUCKER: Sim?
T'POL: He said he had feelings for me.
TUCKER: He told you that.
T'POL: Standing right there.
TUCKER: What the hell was he doing in your room?
T'POL: Your voice is tensing up.
TUCKER: Oh, now you're the vocal expert.
T'POL: I don't need to be an expert to read you.
TUCKER: I can't believe this. I'm jealous of myself?
T'POL: You're jealous?
TUCKER: No, absolutely not. Okay, maybe. Maybe I am, a little.
T'POL: Which would mean you're attracted to me. It goes with the
assumption.
TUCKER: What just happened here? Did we? Are we?
(She kisses him, then completely disrobes.)
 [Sickbay]
 ALIEN: You're not like the others on this ship.
PHLOX: They're from a different world than I am.
ALIEN: What are they called, your two worlds?
PHLOX: Mine is called Denobula, my shipmates are from Earth.
ALIEN: Am I going to die?
PHLOX: I'm doing everything I can.
ALIEN: I'm grateful to you for trying, Doctor.
PHLOX: Try to rest.
(Phlox goes over to a monitor and the alien grabs him, his arm passing
through Phlox's throat and knocking him out. The alien goes for a walk
through the walls.)
 [Cargo bay]
 (Reed is shadow-fighting in front of a large
mirror as Hayes enters.)
REED: Are you leaving so soon?
HAYES: I don't want to distract you.
REED: It's no distraction. In fact, I could use a sparring partner, if
you're up for it.
HAYES: Always. Good forearm block. Nice back-fist. Show me the
combination.
(Reed gets thrown.)
HAYES: Faster on that combination. You're improving.
REED: You want to keep that left up. That's it, stay loose, excellent
(He gets in a rabbit punch.)
REED: You're improving.
(Reed pins Hayes to the floor.)
REED: You see, you were looking at my hands when you should have been
looking at my eyes.
HAYES: Okay, Lieutenant.
REED: Major.
(Reed gives the bring it on sign and ends up on his back.)
HAYES: Tell me something.
REED: What.
HAYES: Why won't you let me do my job?
REED: Because you're here to enhance the combat capacity of this crew,
not take over security.
HAYES: Is that what this is all about? You think I want to replace you?
REED: You just can't stand taking orders from me, can you.
HAYES: I have no problems taking orders from you.
(Hayes gives Reed a good beating.)
HAYES: After lunar survival training I could handle just about
anything. Good sparring with you.
REED: Hayes!
 [Corridor]
 (The fight continues into the corridor.)
REED: (to passing crewman) As you were.
(The crewman carefully retraces his steps as the pair carry on beating
seven bells out of each other.)
HAYES: (completely floored) What was that?
REED: (barely standing) It's a little Klingon move I picked up.
(They square up again, when )
ARCHER [OC]: Tactical alert. Senior officers to their posts.
 [Bridge]
 (As the alien continues to walk through bulkheads,
startling crew members.)
T'POL: He's disrupting systems as he goes. We can use that to track
him. (lights dim) That was the secondary relay coupling.
ARCHER: He's on B deck.
T'POL: Between the A1 and A3 bulkheads.
 [Corridor]
 REED: We're coming up on access tube seventeen
baker.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: He's moving in your direction.
 [Corridor]
 REED: Can you be any more specific?
(The alien walks out of a console and down another corridor. Reed and
Hayes shoot at him, but of course phase pistol fire is useless.)
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Malcolm, status.
REED [OC]: Our weapons had no effect on him.
 [Corridor]
 REED: He's heading towards the centre of the ship.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Archer to Engineering.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: Tucker.
(Just as things go bang. Reed finds him unconscious.)
HAYES: Lieutenant.
(The alien climbs onto the warp drive and sticks his hand in.
Everything goes crazy and the crew get thrown about.)
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Magnetic containment is fluctuating.
 [Engineering]
 REED: We need to reverse polarity on the plasma
coils. It'll trigger a feedback pulse. Turn the T-valve all the way to
the left.
HAYES: All right.
(Reed is at the warp core controls.)
REED: Let's see if you can handle this.
(The alien screams, becomes totally solid and is thrown to the floor.)
 [Mess hall]
 TUCKER: Morning.
T'POL: Commander.
TUCKER: Coffee, strong. Some night.
T'POL: Eventful.
TUCKER: I don't know who did more damage to the engine, the alien or
Malcolm.
T'POL: How long before we can get underway?
TUCKER: Another day at least. I guess we should talk about what
happened last night.
T'POL: I've been briefed on the situation.
TUCKER: Well, I was referring to what happened between us, in your
quarters. I guess I'll go first. Actually, why don't you go first?
T'POL: I suppose I should thank you.
TUCKER: No need to thank me.
T'POL: For facilitating my exploration of human sexuality.
TUCKER: I'm not sure I follow.
T'POL: It's one of the many aspects of your species which I've been
meaning to explore since I left the High Command.
TUCKER: Sounds like you're saying last night was some kind of
experiment.
T'POL: I wouldn't use that term.
TUCKER: But that's the general idea.
T'POL: Are you getting emotional?
TUCKER: No, I'm not getting emotional. I just don't like being compared
to a lab rat.
T'POL: I'm sorry if I offended you.
TUCKER: Forget it. I'd appreciate it if we could keep this between us.
In fact, we probably should forget it ever happened.
T'POL: Agreed.
TUCKER: Doesn't mean we can't keep doing the neuro-pressure though.
 [Ready room]
 (A pair of visibly bruised and battered men are
standing to attention.)
ARCHER: Doctor Phlox says you have a detached retina, a bruised left
kidney. We're in a dangerous region of space. We're trying to stop an
alien race from destroying Earth. We face attacks from all sides,
enemies everywhere we go. The last thing I need is to hear that two of
my senior officers have been admitted to Sickbay because they suddenly
regressed to the level of five year olds.
REED: Captain.
ARCHER: Don't try to tell me who started it! I don't know what the
problem is between you two, and to tell you the truth I don't care, but
I want it settled right now. Settle it! That's an order!
REED: There's no problem, Captain.
HAYES: It's settled, sir.
ARCHER: How are the drills going?
HAYES: Good, sir.
REED: Very good, sir. (intercom beeps)
ARCHER: Archer.
PHLOX [OC]: Please come to Sickbay, Captain. The alien has regained
consciousness.
ARCHER: On my way.
(Archer leaves.)
REED: Think we're dismissed?
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: I'm afraid there's nothing I can do.
(the alien is phasing in and out, obviously in pain)
ARCHER: You weren't sent here against your will. You know exactly what
your mission was. What were your people trying to do? You tried to
destroy my ship. Why? Answer me!
ALIEN: When the Xindi destroy Earth, my people will prevail.
(The alien vanishes. Archer thumps
the biobed in frustration)
ARCHER: Damn.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Doctor's Orders
Doctor's
Orders
 Original Airdate: 18 Feb, 2004

(Enterprise is travelling slowly through one of the special effects
department's ubiquitous purple hazes, and the ship appears deserted -
except for one canine running away from ...)
 [Corridor]
 PHLOX: Porthos, come back here. Porthos, stop.
Return. Heel, that's it. Heel. Porthos.
(Outside Archer's quarters, the faithful companion scratches at the
door and yips.)
PHLOX: All right, but just for a moment.
 [Archer's quarters]
 (Porthos jumps onto the still figure on the bed
and licks his face.)
PHLOX: That's enough. You can come and see him again tomorrow.
(Phlox picks Porthos up and leaves. Archer never even twitched.)
 [Phlox's quarters]
 PHLOX: (reading) It says here that canines can be
quite territorial. Is that why you keep returning to the Captain's
quarters? On Earth, a dog called Scruffers travelled three thousand
kilometres attempting to reunite with it's human keeper. I heard of a
Pycan space moth that drifted half a light year trying to return to
it's home world, but I don't believe it had a name. I could use a walk.
How about you?
 [Corridor]
 PHLOX: (dictating) Dear Doctor Lucas. I apologise
in responding to your last letter. As you can imagine, the crew and I
have been quite busy.
 [Galley]
 PHLOX: In we go. I
was deeply saddened to hear about your colleagues lost in the Xindi
attack. You have my condolences. It's unfortunate you were forced to
cut your time on Denobula short, but obviously you're needed on Earth.
Perhaps when our mission is successfully completed I'll see you back in
San Francisco. The Expanse. An extremely curious place. (He takes
something from a jar labeled Dr Phlox - do not eat.) PHLOX: For example, we've
recently encountered a phenomenon that, er. (to Porthos) Do you want
one of these? I doubt you'd like it. It's a leech, you know. It will
clean out your intestinal tract. Don't tell the Captain. (Porthos
catches the morsel.) PHLOX: I apparently find myself in somewhat unsettling
circumstances, Doctor Lucas. Although they have allowed me the luxury
of catching up on my correspondence.
(Phlox eats a leech himself.)
 [Situation room]
 PHLOX [OC]: We first encountered the phenomenon
responsible for this situation two days ago.
T'POL: It's directly on our route to Azati Prime.
ARCHER: Why didn't sensors pick it up before now?
T'POL: Because it wasn't there before now. It's similar to the
phenomenon we encountered several weeks ago.
ARCHER: A trans-dimensional disturbance.
T'POL: This region is being rapidly reconfigured as we speak.
ARCHER: How long would it take to go around it?
T'POL: Two weeks.
REED: Another detour.
T'POL: Perhaps not. Since this region was formed only recently, it
hasn't been completely reconfigured. We should still be able to cross
it safely.
TUCKER: You said nothing from our universe could survive inside these
things.
T'POL: Doctor.
PHLOX: That's true, unless we take the appropriate precautions. The
reconfigured space disrupts the human neocortex, but I can counteract
the effects by dampening the crew's neurological activity. It would be
like, oh, shutting down the main computer to protect it from an ion
storm.
TUCKER: How do you plan to shut down our neocortexes?
PHLOX: Quite simply, I can place each of you in a comatose state until
we've passed through the affected region.
ARCHER: How quickly can we get across it?
T'POL: Less than an hour at warp four.
TUCKER: I don't want to risk going to warp in there. Who knows what
kind of effect this disturbance will have on our warp field. We'll be
safer sticking to impulse. You'll have to keep us in comas for at least
four days.
REED: That's still less time than it would take to go around it.
ARCHER: Can you keep us under that long?
PHLOX: Shouldn't cause any problems.
 [Travis's quarters]
 PHLOX: Commander Tucker was none too keen on my
plan. However, I was able to convince Captain Archer. Since my
Denobulan physiology is immune to the effects of the disturbance, I
volunteered to watch over the crew. So far, they've been no trouble at
all.
 [Bridge - memory]
 (Phlox is getting a practical driving lesson.)
PHLOX [OC]: While the computer's controlling most of the ship's
systems, I was given a quick tutorial, just in case. Despite the dire
circumstances I must say I relished the challenge and soon developed a
new-found respect for Ensign Mayweather.
 [Engineering - memory]
 TUCKER: You need to check this every two hours,
minimum.
PHLOX: Every two hours.
TUCKER: If the impulse manifolds get clogged, the engines'll overload.
That would be very bad.
PHLOX: I imagine it would.
TUCKER: No offence, Doc, but under normal circumstances I wouldn't even
let you in here without four years of Starfleet training under your
belt.
PHLOX: These are hardly normal circumstances.
TUCKER: Listen. If something happens, something you can't handle, I
want you to wake me up.
PHLOX: I can't do that. Even a few minutes of exposure would cause
permanent damage.
TUCKER: If it comes down to saving the ship? Look, I'm making it easy
for you. Okay?
 [Archer's quarters]
 ARCHER: How's the rest of the crew doing?
PHLOX: Sleeping peacefully, except for you. Now, lie back.
ARCHER: Doctor.
PHLOX: Please, Captain, I've told you the procedure's completely safe.
ARCHER: I'm sure it is, but I
PHLOX: Captain, I have already had this discussion with Commander
Tucker, Lieutenant Reed and virtually every other officer on the ship.
I'm not comfortable being incapacitated, I really should be at my post,
I'm willing to risk staying awake. Well you can't, nor do you need to.
I assure you I have everything well in hand.
ARCHER: I know, Doctor. As Captain of the ship I'm the one who's
responsible for everyone aboard. There aren't many people I'd willingly
turn that responsibility over to. You're one of them.
PHLOX: Well, thank you, Captain.
ARCHER: I just wanted to say that before you put me under.
(Archer lies down on his bed, and Phlox does the deed.)
PHLOX [OC]: I must say, Doctor Lucas, that I appreciated the Captain's
vote of confidence. I had in fact been feeling some trepidation over
the responsibility I'd been handed, but after two days at the helm the
ship is running perfectly.
 [Engineering]
 (He hears a door slamming somewhere.)
PHLOX: Hello? Hello? (finds no one) Nonetheless, I'm not ashamed to
admit I'll be relieved when I can wake up the crew in two days, sixteen
hours and forty three minutes.
 [Sickbay]
 (Phlox jogs down a corridor, singing something Denobulan,
with Porthos following him. In Sickbay, strategically placed items spare our blushes as a
naked Phlox comes in to feed his menagerie.)
PHLOX: I know, I know, I'm sorry I'm late.
 [Mess hall]
 (Movie night is The Court Jester starring Danny
Kaye.)
HAWKINS: I don't want the vessel with the pestle, I want the chalice
from the what?
JEAN: The chalice from the palace.
WITCH: It's a little crystal chalice with a figure of a palace.
HAWKINS: The chalice from the palace have the pellet with the poison?
WITCH: No, the pellet with the poison's in the vessel with a pestle.
HAWKINS: Oh, oh, the pestle with the vessel.
JEAN: The vessel with a pestle.
HAWKINS: What about the palace from the chalice?
WITCH: Not the palace from the chalice! The chalice from the palace!
HAWKINS: Where's the pellet with the poison?
WITCH: In the vessel with a pestle!
JEAN: Don't you see? The pellet with the poison's in the vessel with
the pestle.
WITCH: The chalice from the palace has the brew that is true!
JEAN: It's so easy, I can say it!
HAWKINS: Well then you fight him!
WITCH: Listen carefully. The pellet with the poison's in the vessel
with a pestle, the chalice from the palace has the brew that is true.
HAWKINS: Where the pellet with the poison's in the vessel with a
pestle, the chalice from the palace has the brew that is true.
JEAN: Good man!
PHLOX: (to Porthos, his faithful companion) Did you hear that?
WITCH: Just remember that.
MAN: Sir Giacomo, into your armour, and you to your place in the
pavilion.
HAWKINS: The pellet with the poison, the pellet with the poison.
PHLOX: Computer, mute sound. (I have no idea what he hears) That
doesn't sound normal, does it. I suppose we should investigate, hmm.
I'm not going alone. Come, Porthos, come. (picks him up) I'd be better
off talking to my Pyrithian bat.
 [Corridor]
 PHLOX: Perhaps we are letting our imaginations run
away with us. I should never have let Mister Tucker talk me into
watching The Exorcist last week. (Another strange clunk.)
 [Launch bay]
 PHLOX: Hello? It's Doctor Phlox. (Porthos barks)
Porthos! Porthos, come back here. Porthos.
(He sees a vent of steam rattling a chain handrail.)
PHLOX: Well, now don't you feel foolish.
(A door closes, and he turns to see - and clutches at his heart.)
PHLOX: I called out. Didn't you hear me?
T'POL: I was running a diagnostic. Do you require my assistance? What
are you doing here? I thought it was movie night.
PHLOX: You could hear that all the way from the mess hall.
T'POL: I'll make a note of it in the maintenance log.
PHLOX: Bangs, squeaks, rattling chains. (He turns off the venting steam.)
PHLOX: Is this a starship or a haunted house?
T'POL: Are you all right, Doctor? You seem somewhat agitated.
PHLOX: Considering you nearly sent me into cardiac shock.
T'POL: I apologise if I startled you. You're certain that's all?
PHLOX: I have had a slight headache since we entered this region.
Perhaps Vulcans and Earth canines are better able to adapt to it than
Denobulans. How are you? I've barely seen you the last two days.
T'POL: I've had my duties to attend to. The rest of the time I've spent
in my quarters, reading, meditating.
PHLOX: Then you're due for a night out. Why don't you join Porthos and
me?
T'POL: I'd like to complete the diagnostic.
PHLOX: The movie's quite amusing.
T'POL: No, thank you.
PHLOX: T'Pol, I, er, perhaps you'll share a meal with me later.
T'POL: If you like.
 [Engineering]
 (Another door sound.)
PHLOX: Hello? (and again) T'Pol? Is that you? (It seems like someone runs
along the upper walkway.) PHLOX: Stop! Phlox to T'Pol.
T'POL [OC]: Go ahead.
PHLOX: Would you mind not creeping around the ship like a Draxxan cloud
viper.
T'POL [OC]: Doctor?
PHLOX: Please. I wouldn't have imagined that Vulcans engaged in
childish games.
T'POL [OC]: I don't understand.
PHLOX: What were you doing in Engineering just now?
T'POL [OC]: Doctor, I'm on the Bridge.
 [Galley]
 PHLOX: I hope you don't mind eating here in the
galley. Mess hall seems a bit, er, oh, melancholy. All the empty
chairs.
T'POL: This is fine.
PHLOX: My fifth grandmother made this for each of my weddings (ladling
liquid). Chef's tried to prepare it, but he never gets it quite right.
T'POL: Yes, his plomeek broth leaves something to be desired as well.
PHLOX: I always thought so, but was afraid to mention it. T'Pol, you're
sure you weren't in Engineering today?
T'POL: Quite sure. What were you doing there? I'm responsible for
monitoring the engines.
PHLOX: We're supposed to be assisting each other. It's a large ship for
two people to maintain.
T'POL: Do you have anything to report? Doctor?
PHLOX: I could have sworn there was someone in that room with me.
T'POL: A member of the crew?
PHLOX: No, everyone except us is in deep neuro-sedation.
T'POL: Then obviously you were mistaken.
PHLOX: Obviously. You've never been to Denobula, have you.
T'POL: No.
PHLOX: The cities are quite crowded, by choice, not by necessity. The
atmosphere is vibrant, communal.
T'POL: It sounds fascinating.
PHLOX: What I'm saying is that we're a sociable people. Being alone on
Enterprise, just the two of us, has proven more stressful than I
imagined. Two people aren't even enough for a Denobulan marriage, a
proper one anyway.
T'POL: I'm sorry I haven't been better company.
PHLOX: That isn't what I meant.
T'POL: I know. It is ironic, however, that I should be your sole
companion. Unlike your people, most Vulcans will go to great lengths to
find solitude. At times it has been trying for me to co-exist with
eighty humans. Especially the more irrational ones.
PHLOX: Such as Commander Tucker.
T'POL: I've found the last two days to be a welcome respite.
PHLOX: I understand, but I for one will never complain again when I
can't get a good seat on movie night.
(T'Pol has not touched the food)
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: (dictating) Despite the tragic
circumstances surrounding your homecoming, Doctor Lucas, you must be
happy to return to Earth. As I've mentioned before, I've no regrets
about accepting my position on Enterprise. However, it has struck me
recently how much I miss the familiar pleasures of my home.
 [Corridor]
 PHLOX: You've experienced the nightclubs in our
Kaybin district, so you know the excitement of meeting a new companion
or two. The intimacy that can develop so quickly when all parties are
receptive. You humans are a truly remarkable species, Doctor Lucas, but
when Enterprise has accomplished its mission I look forward to being
among Denobulans again. The more of them, the better.
 [Archer's quarters]
 PHLOX: Good afternoon, Captain. How are we feeling
today? Neurochemistry looks excellent, theta waves are good, you should
wake up extremely well rested. (There's a creaking noise. He looks out
of the porthole and recoils as something comes at him.) PHLOX: Phlox to T'Pol.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Internal sensors don't show any additional
biosigns.
PHLOX: I told you, it was outside of the ship, on the hull.
T'POL: There are no lifeforms anywhere in this vicinity.
PHLOX: What about alien vessels?
T'POL: You can see for yourself there's nothing there.
PHLOX: You said this reconfigured space could be affecting our systems.
What if it's interfering with our sensors?
T'POL: That's possible, but we should consider another explanation. You
mentioned you were having difficulty adjusting to the solitude of the
past few days.
PHLOX: I didn't imagine it! I saw something.
T'POL: Outside the ship, crawling on the hull.
PHLOX: What about what I saw in Engineering?
T'POL: You ran the scans yourself. There is nothing unusual on board.
You said you haven't slept much since we entered this disturbance.
Perhaps you should return to your quarters, try to rest.
PHLOX: I need to finish my rounds.
 [Hoshi's quarters]
 (He sees an Insectoid standing over Hoshi.)
PHLOX: Get away from her!
(It comes after him, so he runs down a corridor, sees the shadow of
another and hides in an airlock.)
 [Corridor]
 PHLOX: Phlox to T'Pol.
T'POL [OC]: Go ahead, Doctor.
PHLOX: It's the Xindi. They're on board.
 [Armoury]
 PHLOX: We'll need to arm ourselves. I saw two.
There could be more of them.
T'POL: There's nothing on sensors.
PHLOX: Then the sensors must be wrong.
T'POL: Doctor. Phlox! I thought you were going to get some rest.
PHLOX: They were real. I saw them.
T'POL: If that's true, then how did they get on the ship? All external
hatches and docking ports are sealed.
PHLOX: They could have transporter technology.
T'POL: There were no transporter signatures.
PHLOX: What difference does it make how they got on board. If we wake
up Lieutenant Reed or the MACOs they will be incapacitated in minutes,
dead within hours. It is up to us to deal with this situation. I plan
to start on G deck and work my way up. (She doesn't take the weapon he
offers her.) PHLOX: I'm going to stop them whether you help me or not.
 [Corridor]
 T'POL: We've searched four decks.
PHLOX: That leaves three to go.
T'POL: If there are Xindi aboard, why are they concealing themselves?
PHLOX: They could be trying to destroy Enterprise. What better time
than while the crew is incapacitated. (his scanner beeps) A biosign.
T'POL: There are over eighty biosigns aboard, not counting your pets in
Sickbay.
PHLOX: This isn't human.
T'POL: Neither are your pets.
PHLOX: I can't lock onto it.
T'POL: There must be some interference, possibly from the reconfigured
space.
PHLOX: You said it wasn't affecting our sensors.
T'POL: I said it wasn't affecting main sensors. That hand scanner is
far less powerful, you know that.
PHLOX: I have it. (further on) It's just ahead. (something comes round
the corner, Phlox fires and thankfully misses Porthos)
T'POL: Doctor!
PHLOX: It's all right. Fortunately I'm not very proficient with hand
weapons.
T'POL: How did he get out?
PHLOX: I, er, I believe I. We went for a walk earlier. I might have
neglected to put him back in my quarters.
T'POL: And you simply forgot.
PHLOX: I've been distracted. I would have thought this could tell the
difference between a giant insect and a beagle.
T'POL: It can, if you use it properly.
PHLOX: You're the science officer, you might have offered some
assistance in that area.
T'POL: You feel I haven't been helpful? How would you characterise the
two hours I wasted searching for a figment of your imagination?
PHLOX: I'm not delusional.
T'POL: Are you certain? As I recall, you once told Ensign Sato that
it's considered healthy for Denobulans to hallucinate. It's how you
release stress. You've been under a lot of stress lately, haven't you,
Doctor.
PHLOX: It's not unheard of, but I
T'POL: You said you've been having headaches. Is there anything else
you care to tell me?
PHLOX: I'm fine.
T'POL: You nearly shot the Captain's dog!
PHLOX: I'm going to recalibrate this to exclude canine biosigns and
then I'm going to finish searching this ship. I'm not seeing things and
I intend to prove it. (stomps off)
HOSHI [OC]: Ensign Sato to the Doctor.
PHLOX: Hoshi? Hoshi?
 [Hoshi's quarters]
 (The shower is running, her bed is empty.)
PHLOX: Ensign? Hoshi? What are you doing? I have to put you back under
sedation immediately. You'll suffer permanent damage. (He sees a
disfigured woman.) PHLOX: Hoshi?
HOSHI: You did this.
PHLOX: What?
HOSHI: You said we'd be safe.
PHLOX: Let me get you to Sickbay.
HOSHI: You promised us!
(Phlox backs away, falls over, then sees Hoshi lying peacefully on her bed.)
PHLOX: T'Pol, please meet me in Sickbay immediately.
 [Corridor outside turbolift]
 ARCHER: Where've you been? I was calling you.
PHLOX: Captain. What are you doing up?
ARCHER: T'Pol woke me. She said something was wrong.
PHLOX: I don't know what's happening.
ARCHER: She said you've been seeing things. Something about Xindi on
board the ship.
PHLOX: You're not concerned about that? (He starts backing away down the
corridor.)
ARCHER: I'm more concerned about you. I obviously expected too much
from you.
PHLOX: You're not real.
ARCHER: Why don't you go to your quarters. Lie down. I'll take over.
You did the best you could.
PHLOX: You are not real!
T'POL: Doctor.
(Phlox turns to look at her, and when he looks back, Archer has gone.)
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: I was so busy monitoring the crew I never
thought to run another neural scan on myself. The effects are subtle
and difficult to detect, but there are disruptions deep within my
neocortex. You were right. I was hallucinating.
T'POL: Are you in danger?
PHLOX: I don't believe there'll be any permanent damage. However, it's
obviously affecting my judgment. I have no choice but to put myself
under neuro-sedation and ask you to look after the crew.
T'POL: I don't have the medical expertise.
PHLOX: With your scientific background, you should have no problems.
T'POL: I have my own duties. I can't possibly monitor the entire crew.
PHLOX: It won't be for long. We'll be coming out of the disturbance in
less than six hours. T'Pol, I'm asking for your help.
T'POL: I can't.
PHLOX: Why not?
T'POL: When we were searching the ship, I became irritated with you.
PHLOX: Apparently, I deserved it.
T'POL: You don't understand. I was on the verge of losing control of my
emotions. This reconfigured space is effecting me as well.
PHLOX: Why didn't you tell me?
T'POL: I'd hoped to control it, but it's proven more difficult than I
thought. The crew is better off in your hands.
PHLOX: I doubt that. I nearly killed Porthos, remember. What if one of
these delusions causes me to open an airlock or shut down life support?
T'POL: You won't do that.
PHLOX: How do you know?
T'POL: Because your duty is to look out for the welfare of this crew.
Why do you think the Captain allowed you to sedate him over Commander
Tucker's objections? Because he trusts you, as do I.
PHLOX: I'm not sure I trust myself.
T'POL: Just a few more hours, Doctor.
 [Bridge]
 PHLOX [OC]: So, Doctor Lucas, while the past few
days have proven challenging, both T'Pol and I are relieved that our
adventure is nearly over.
PHLOX: (taking the helm) Once we've confirmed we're out of the
disturbance I can begin waking the senior officers. My medical staff
should be next. They can assist me with the rest of the(He gazes in
disbelief at a purple viewscreen.) PHLOX: We should have been out of the
disturbance half an hour ago.
T'POL: There could have been some slight navigational discrepancies.
PHLOX: I thought space travel was supposed to be precise.
T'POL: Not always. Check long range sensors. (Phlox dashes to the back of the Situation room.) PHLOX: What do you think
I'm doing. There's more than a slight discrepancy.
T'POL: This can't be correct. We're nearly a quarter of a light year
from the far edge.
PHLOX: At our current rate of speed we won't be out of this for another
ten weeks! Autonavigation is still engaged, engines are online, why
aren't we through?
T'POL: The reconfigured space has expanded.
PHLOX: But we knew it would. Travis said our course and speed would
compensate. T'Pol?
T'POL: Obviously the rate of acceleration has accelerated. We need to
increase speed.
PHLOX: We're already at full impulse.
T'POL: As you can see, that's insufficient. We need to go to warp.
PHLOX: Commander Tucker said it would be too dangerous. We don't know
what might happen.
T'POL: What do you propose? Keeping the crew comatose for the next ten
weeks?
 [Engineering]
 PHLOX: All right, what do we do first?
T'POL: I'm afraid I may not be of much assistance.
PHLOX: Do I need to keep reminding you, you are the Science Officer.
T'POL: I already told you, I'm finding it difficult to focus.
PHLOX: On your worst day you're more qualified to operate the warp
engines than I am.
T'POL: Unfortunately, this is by far one of my worst days.
PHLOX: I'm a physician, not an engineer.
T'POL: You hold a dozen scientific degrees.
PHLOX: None of them are in warp theory.
T'POL: The procedures for restarting the reactor are in the database.
PHLOX: You're suggesting I read the manual? (but he does, from a
screen) Output must be confined to within three hundred and three
hundred twelve millicochranes to prevent fusion of the dilithium
matrix.
T'POL: That seems simple enough.
PHLOX: Unless the spatial compression index is greater than five point
six two percent, or the ship is within two parsecs of a class C
gravimetric field distortion?
T'POL: I realise this is a complex procedure.
PHLOX: Complex? This is utterly baffling. It might as well be written
ancient Klingon for all the sense I can make of it. I'm sorry.
T'POL: I understand. I just wish I could be more helpful.
PHLOX: You're doing fine. We have to close the plasma relays before we
can begin the start-up sequence. Would you mind?
TUCKER: What the hell are you doing? I told you not to mess with the
warp engines.
PHLOX: I don't have time for this.
TUCKER: You'd better make time, Doc. I told you, you can't start the
warp reactor inside this disturbance.
PHLOX: Actually you told me it would be difficult, not impossible.
TUCKER: That machine was designed to manipulate space, to violate the
laws of motion. You make the tiniest mistake, you'll collapse the warp
field, you'll crush this ship.
PHLOX: Thank you for the warning.
TUCKER: You're going to screw this up, Phlox!
PHLOX: Go away.
TUCKER: You're going to kill everybody.
PHLOX: Can't you see I'm busy!
T'POL: Doctor, are you all right?
PHLOX: Fine.
T'POL: Doctor, I can't find the plasma relays.
PHLOX: I'll do it myself. (He goes to the main reactor controls.) PHLOX: Deuterium
pressure is nominal. Anti-matter constrictor coils are online. Warp two
should be sufficient.
T'POL: Shall we try?
(Bits of engine room start to light up.)
PHLOX: The intermix is stable. A warp field is forming.
(An alarm sounds.)
T'POL: What's wrong?
PHLOX: I don't know. (The ship shakes and the nacelles stutter.) PHLOX: I
followed the procedures exactly. What did I do wrong?
T'POL: You need to
PHLOX: What? What, T'Pol? Help me. Is it the particle confinement?
T'POL: Perhaps you should increase it.
PHLOX: How do I do that? (He dashes to his help screen.) PHLOX: Particle
confinement, particle confinement. (Things go bang.)
T'POL: Doctor, perhaps we should wake Commander
Tucker.
PHLOX: He'll die.
T'POL: If we destroy the ship, we'll all die.
PHLOX: I know.
T'POL: If we can't accomplish our mission, billions of people on Earth
could die. Isn't it logical to sacrifice one life to save so many?
PHLOX: I'm not willing to make that sacrifice yet. Particle
confinement. Increase power to the magnetic constriction coils. (She
can't touch the controls, and looks plaintively at him.) PHLOX: T'Pol! Here.
(He does it himself and the shaking stops.)
T'POL: The field is stabilising.
PHLOX: It's holding.
T'POL: Then I suggest we go to warp.
PHLOX: Engaging warp engines. Warp one point one, point two. (The
engine gets unhappy again.) PHLOX: Pressure on the hull's increasing.
T'POL: What are you doing?
PHLOX: Lieutenant Reed insisted on showing me how to transfer power to
the hull plating, just in case. It seems to be working. Warp one point
eight, one point nine, warp two!
 [Archer's quarters]
 (Safely back in normal space, Phlox removes the
neural inhibitor from Archer's forehead and gives him a hypo.)
ARCHER: Doctor.
PHLOX: Lie still. Your neocortex may need a few moments to warm up.
ARCHER: Are we through the disturbance?
PHLOX: Yes. I'll begin waking the rest of the crew shortly.
ARCHER: Any problems?
PHLOX: A few minor glitches. It will all be in my log. If you're
feeling up to it, you have a visitor.
ARCHER: Hey. (fondling Porthos) Thanks, Doctor.
 [Corridor]
 PHLOX: How are you feeling?
TUCKER: A little woozy.
PHLOX: I'm not surprised. You haven't eaten anything in four days. Get
to the Mess hall.
TUCKER: Aye, aye, Doc. (Tucker leaves.)
T'POL: I'll assist you in waking the others.
PHLOX: Oh, that won't be necessary. I appreciate the offer but you need
some rest. Let me walk you to your quarters.
T'POL: Doctor's orders?
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 T'POL: Thank you.
PHLOX: I'll stop by and check on you in a few hours. (He glances at the
bed and sees T'Pol lying there, comatose. The T'Pol he was talking to
has vanished.)
 [Mess hall]
 PHLOX [OC]: As you might guess, Doctor Lucas, I
had considered deleting this letter and starting over, since large
sections of it are now obviously fictitious. However, I decided that my
delusional account would probably prove entertaining. As always, you
have my best wishes. Your friend and colleague, Phlox.
PHLOX: May I join you?
T'POL: Of course. Commander Tucker was complaining that it will take
him days to realign the warp coils.
PHLOX: Yes, he gave me quite a talking to.
T'POL: He also said, and I quote, Phlox did one hell of a job. You must
have enjoyed having the ship to yourself.
PHLOX: It wasn't nearly as empty as I'd anticipated.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Hatchery
Hatchery
 Mission date: Jan 8, 2154
Original Airdate: 25 Feb, 2004
 
ARCHER: Previously on Enterprise
REED [Bridge]: The Insectoid ship's been damaged.
TUCKER: Target the second one.
HAYES [Cargo bay]: Is that what this is all about? You think that I want to replace
you?
REED: You just can't stand taking orders from me, can you.
HAYES: Tell me something.
REED: What.
HAYES: Why won't you let me do my job?
ARCHER [Brig]: I want to know where you're building the weapon.
DEGRA: I don't know what you're talking about.
ARCHER: The hell you don't.
HOSHI [Degra's ship]: There is a reference to a planet he visited recently. Azati
Prime.
T'POL [Command centre]: The coordinates match the location of one of the red giants.
ARCHER [Bridge]: Set a course to Azati Prime, maximum warp.
 [Bridge]
 (In orbit of a brown and white planet.)
ARCHER: Magnify. (There's a crashed ship on the surface.)
REED: It's definitely Xindi, sir. The hull composition matches the
other ships we've seen.
ARCHER: It doesn't look like a reptilian or a primate design. Biosigns?
T'POL: None that I can detect. There's no atmosphere aboard.
ARCHER: Anyone else in the system?
TRAVIS: No, sir.
ARCHER: Put a team together.
REED: Aye, sir.
 [Crashed ship]
 (The EV-suited team finds a couple of insectoid
bodies.)
ARCHER: We'll take them back to Enterprise. Tell Phlox I want a
complete autopsy. (to T'Pol) The Major and I will search the port side.
See if you can access their ship's database.
(Archer and Hayes find a closed door, and pries it up to reveal a huge
chamber. They investigate, while elsewhere -)
T'POL: It's a computer interface.
TUCKER: See what you can download.
REED: My father'd love to get a look at this place. He's fascinated by
insects, always filling the house up with bugs he's collected. Drives
my mother crazy.
TUCKER: Maybe we can bring home something new for his collection. (Tucker and Reed are at a bulkhead that Tucker's scanner has lead him to.)
REED: It's heavily
reinforced.
(They open the hexagonal hatch and step through.)
 [Hatchery airlock]
 (The hatch shuts automatically behind them.)
REED: It's pressurising. Oxygen nitrogen atmosphere.
TUCKER: After you. (Reed opens his helmet a little.)
REED: A little stale, but breathable.
Biosigns, very faint. Coming from in here. (Another hatch.)
 [Xindi shuttlebay]
 (investigating a craft inside the huge chamber)
HAYES: Some kind of shuttlecraft?
ARCHER: More like an assault vehicle. I'm reading a half dozen particle
cannons, torpedo launchers. Archer.
TUCKER [OC]: You'd better get over here, sir.
 [Hatchery]
 (Archer and Hayes enter the hatchery to find their
colleagues gazing in wonder at the things hanging from the ceiling, and
the fact that the power is on. They remove their helmets.)
T'POL: The DNA is identical to the bodies we found. They would appear
to be the crew's offspring.
ARCHER: A hatchery?
TUCKER: They built this place to take quite a beating. Reinforced
bulkheads, back-up power systems.
T'POL: Thirty one eggs are still viable.
TUCKER: They won't survive for long. The bio-support's losing power.
ARCHER: Do you think you can repair it?
TUCKER: I wouldn't even know where to start.
ARCHER: There's a shuttlecraft in their port bay. Get it back to the
ship. I want an analysis of their tactical systems as soon as possible.
REED: Aye sir. (He leaves with Tucker. Archer looks at a cluster of dangling eggs.)
ARCHER: Did you find their
Bridge?
T'POL: I'm not certain there is one. Their command functions appear to
be distributed through various (Archer gets splattered by a dangling
egg.) T'POL: Captain!
ARCHER: I'm all right.
T'POL: We should get you to Sickbay.
 [Sickbay]
 (Archer has a bright rash where the egg squirted
him.)
PHLOX: A mild neurotoxin. Likely part of an autonomic defence system.
The egg probably considered you a threat.
ARCHER: Humans seem to have that effect on the Xindi.
PHLOX: An analgesic should take care of the irritation.
ARCHER: Malcolm's bringing you two dead insectoids. I want you to learn
as much as you can about them.
PHLOX: Understood.
T'POL: We've located their Armoury. We found several particle weapons
and torpedo casings.
ARCHER: What about the data you recovered?
T'POL: Ensign Sato's translating it. We'll be ready to leave orbit as
soon as the Xindi shuttle's aboard.
 [Shuttlepod]
(Towing the Xindi shuttle, which is about the same
size.)
REED: We've cleared the thermosphere. (The pod shakes, and a corpse
falls over.) REED: You might want to do a better job securing our guests.
(Hayes kicks the bodybag.) REED: I think it's safe to assume it's dead.
HAYES: Just being cautious. (He puts it back on the bench and straps it
in.) HAYES: Certain insects on Earth are known to hibernate. (Hayes sits down and
draws his weapon.)
REED: Do you intent do shoot me, Major?
HAYES: It's not you I'm worried about. I've been going over the results
from the last training session. Your senior officers have shown a lot
of improvement, but I think they can do better. With your permission
I'd like to schedule some more target practice for Monday evening.
REED: That won't go over well with Commander Tucker. Monday night is
movie night.
HAYES: Maybe he can sacrifice some leisure time for the sake of this
mission.
REED: The senior officers do have other duties. We can't all spend our
time playing holographic games in the Armoury.
HAYES: I'm not sure that's how the Captain would see it.
HOSHI [OC]: Enterprise to Shuttlepod two. You're clear to approach.
REED: Acknowledged. Deploy the docking arm.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in.
(T'Pol and Tucker enter.)
TUCKER: I think we figured out what happened to them. One of the
nacelles fractured when they were coming out of a subspace vortex. They
probably tried to make an emergency landing on this planet.
ARCHER: According to Phlox, the insectoids we found weren't killed in
the crash, they suffocated?
T'POL: Most of the crew appear to have died when they transferred their
life-support to the hatchery.
ARCHER: They sacrificed themselves to save their children. You said the
hatchery's losing biosupport. How long will it last?
TUCKER: Another day, at most.
ARCHER: I want you to assign a team to repair it.
TUCKER: Captain?
T'POL: What about Azati Prime?
ARCHER: It's not going anywhere. This is a sentient species. We can't
abandon them.
TUCKER: Captain, with all due respect, why the hell not? I've got half
a mind to take a plasma torch to that place.
ARCHER: What if we found a nursery filled with thirty one infant
primates. Would you want to torch them? The Xindi are trying to destroy
Earth because they heard that humans are ruthless. This is a chance to
prove them wrong.
T'POL: We can bring the eggs aboard, reconfigure one of the cargo bays.
ARCHER: I already talked to Phlox. He says they're integrated into the
hatchery walls. If we remove them, they'll die.
TUCKER: Sir, this is crazy. These people are trying to kill us.
ARCHER: This isn't open for discussion. I'll lead the engineering team.
I need you up here to help Travis figure out how to operate that Xindi
shuttle.
TUCKER: Captain.
ARCHER: I've made my decision. Get to work.
 Captain's Starlog, January 8th 2154. We've been in
orbit for more than a day. The crew is restless, eager to resume our
mission, but I'm certain my decision to stay was the right one.
 [Xindi shuttle]
 TUCKER: They may know how to make a weapon, but
these people could learn a thing or two about designing a comfortable
chair.
TRAVIS: For an Insectoid, maybe they are comfortable.
TUCKER: And the power grid doesn't make much sense. Almost half of it's
routed to structural integrity.
TRAVIS: You could probably fly this thing inside a gas giant.
TUCKER: Assuming you could figure out how to fly it.
TRAVIS: This icon looks like it might represent the impulse manifolds.
TUCKER: Give it a shot. (There's an Insectoid warning then the lights
go out.)
TRAVIS: I don't think this ship likes us very much.
 [Mess hall]
 REED: (using PADD) You're going to have to remove
the relays here and here. That should disable the security protocols.
TUCKER: We can't initialise the engines without them.
TRAVIS: What about the ship on the surface? We might be able to salvage
what we need.
TUCKER: Yeah.
REED: Any word on how much longer he's planning to stay in orbit?
TUCKER: The repairs are moving slow.
REED: I'd be the last to question the Captain's orders, but doesn't it
seem a little odd that we're staying here to save a nest of Xindi?
TUCKER: The Captain thinks it's the right thing to do. We may be at
war, but these creatures need our help.
REED: Meanwhile, their big brothers are trying to destroy Earth.
TRAVIS: Every day we stay here gives them more time to finish their
weapon.
TUCKER: Look, there's a chance we'll run into more insectoids when we
reach that red giant. Spending an extra day or two studying their
tactical systems might be useful.
 [Sickbay]
 (Phlox is in autopsy rubbers standing over an Insectoid with it's chest cavity open, when Archer comes in.)
PHLOX: Ah, Captain. I've learnt quite a bit about this fascinating
fellow. Perhaps fellow is the wrong word. Their species is genderless.
ARCHER: Then who made all those eggs?
PHLOX: They reproduce asexually. Each adult appears capable of
producing multiple egg sacs. I wouldn't be surprised if every insectoid
vessel had it's own hatchery. I'd estimate their lifespan is no more
than twelve Earth years. This individual may be one of the elder
members of the crew. It was nearly ten years old.
ARCHER: What about the hatchery? When will the eggs mature?
PHLOX: Without knowing more about their incubation cycle it's
impossible to say, but probably no more than a week at most. Captain,
if you don't mind my saying, you look as if you could use some rest.
ARCHER: We've got to get the repairs finished.
PHLOX: Surely a few hours sleep wouldn't
ARCHER: Contact me if you find anything else.
 [Hatchery airlock]
 (T'Pol has walked through the Xindi ship without
an EV suit.)
T'POL: Is there a problem, Corporal?
CHANG: No, ma'am.
T'POL: Why are you guarding this chamber?
CHANG: Captain's orders.
 [Hatchery]
 (Archer is working on the main life support
control unit in the middle of the chamber.)
T'POL: Lieutenant Reed's report.
ARCHER: What?
T'POL: You requested a tactical analysis of the Insectoid ship.
ARCHER: Later. Are we ready?
TUCKER: Just a few seconds, Captain.
T'POL: There are two MACOs posted outside.
ARCHER: I asked Major Hayes to assign them. These eggs are vulnerable.
There are breaches in the outer hull. There could be predators around.
T'POL: Aside from microbes, we found no evidence of life on this
planet.
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: We're ready. Start at forty megajoules, but keep an eye on that
matrix converter. Take it up to fifty. (Systems start to light up, then
something goes bang.)
ARCHER: Trip. (An egg sac explodes and an engineer goes flying.) ARCHER: Shut it
down. What happened.
TUCKER: It must have been a surge in the power grid. I'll need a few
minutes, Captain.
(The burst sac contained two babies, one of which is moving slightly.)
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise. Medical emergency.
 [Sickbay]
(Phlox holda the tiny stiff corpse in one hand.)
 PHLOX: There was nothing I could do. I'm sorry.
ARCHER: How's Hoshi coming with that translation.
T'POL: Their iconography is different from the other Xindi species.
It's taking some time.
ARCHER: When she's done, ask her to search their database. See if she
can locate anything about their burial rituals.
T'POL: Do you plan to hold a funeral?
TUCKER [OC]: Tucker to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
TUCKER [OC]: I think I've figured out the problem. Their power grid
can't handle our converters.
 [Hatchery]
 TUCKER: It's going to take at least three days to
make them compatible.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: What about the reactor? Any way to bring
it online?
TUCKER [OC]: It's possible
 [Hatchery]
 TUCKER: But they lost most of their antimatter in
the accident.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: Stand by. Work with Trip. Help him get
their reactor up and running.
T'POL: Sir?
ARCHER: We're going to transfer our antimatter to their ship. Use as
much as you have to.
T'POL: Our reserves are at less than sixty percent.
ARCHER: I'm not going to let any more of them die.
 [Command centre]
 TUCKER: To get that reactor running again, we'll
have to use a third of our antimatter reserves.
REED: Why so much?
TUCKER: Every system on that ship is integrated. The only way to bring
biosupport back online is to power up the whole thing.
REED: That's not going to leave much antimatter for our torpedoes,
never mind our engines.
T'POL: Did you inform the Captain?
TUCKER: I wanted to run it by both of you first.
REED: I never imagined Captain Archer would put the welfare of a few
Xindi before his own people. Do you know, he spent nearly two days in
that hatchery. From what I'm told, he hasn't stopped working long
enough to even sleep!
T'POL: Delay the transfer for now.
TUCKER: The Captain gave us an order.
T'POL: I'll speak with him.
 [Hatchery]
 (Archer's still trying to repair a console, and
Hayes is standing guard)
ARCHER: Where's Trip? Did you bring the antimatter?
T'POL: No.
ARCHER: What's the problem?
T'POL: Initialising their reactor will deplete our reserves by over one
third.
ARCHER: We can spare it. We're only a few light years from the red
giant. We'll still have more than enough fuel get there.
T'POL: We don't know for certain if the weapon is in that system.
ARCHER: There are lives at risk here.
T'POL: Billions of lives are at risk on Earth if our mission fails.
ARCHER: I'm well aware of that. These Xindi are innocent. If we let
them die, we'll be proving to the others that they're right about us. I
don't know much about Vulcan ethics, but humans don't throw morality
out the window when things start getting a little rough.
T'POL: Commander Tucker and Lieutenant Reed also believe that this
would compromise our mission.
ARCHER: Your opinions have been noted. Now get back to Enterprise and
start the antimatter transfer.
T'POL: I'm sorry, Captain. I can't obey that order.
ARCHER: You may not be wearing a uniform, but you can still be charged
with insubordination.
T'POL: Perhaps we should contact Starfleet, and discuss this with
Admiral Forrest.
ARCHER: You're relieved as First Officer. Major, escort T'Pol back to
the ship and confine her to her quarters.
HAYES: Sir?
ARCHER: I gave you an order.
HAYES: Ma'am.
(A glance from the Captain sends the gobsmacked engineers scurrying
back to work.)
 [Archer's quarters]
 (Archer comes out of the bathroom, showered and
shaved, when the doorbell chimes.)
ARCHER: Come in.
TUCKER: The first shuttlepod's on it's way.
ARCHER: How long will it take to transfer the antimatter?
TUCKER: Using both shuttlepods, about four or five hours.
ARCHER: I didn't realise how badly I needed a shower. I've spent too
much time in that hatchery.
TUCKER: If you're looking for a new first officer, you should consider
Malcolm. You're going to want someone on the Bridge full time, and I'm
a little busy at the moment.
ARCHER: I'm happy with the command structure the way it is. This is
only temporary. T'Pol just needed a slap on the wrist.
TUCKER: She's questioned your orders lots of times, but you've never
locked her up before. You have to admit its a little out of the
ordinary.
ARCHER: These aren't ordinary circumstances. T'Pol refused a direct
order in front of the crew. I can't have senior officers behaving like
that, especially on a mission this important.
TUCKER: Maybe you ought to confine me to quarters too, sir, because I'm
still not sure we're doing the right thing here. If the roles were
reversed I can't imagine these Xindi would do the same for us.
ARCHER: My great grandfather was in North Africa during the Eugenics
Wars. His battalion was evacuating civilians from a war zone when they
came under attack. There was a school full of children directly between
them and the enemy. If his men had returned fire, they might have hit
it. So he called the commander on the other side, and got him to agree
to hold his fire long enough to evacuate the school. There are rules,
Trip, even in war. We have to help these children.
 [Armoury]
 (On the screen, an image of Enterprise chases an
image of an Insectoid ship.)
REED: This is what you wanted to show me, a battle simulation?
HAYES: Scenarios like this can tell us a lot about the enemy's tactical
capabilities. Much more that we'd learn from a standard analysis.
REED: I asked you to look for weaknesses in their shields, not to play
more games.
HAYES: This isn't exactly a game, Lieutenant. The simulation found that
they're vulnerable here. They've got minimal shielding around their
impulse manifolds. A pair of torpedoes should be enough to take out the
engines.
REED: Those manifolds are pretty narrow, but our targeting scanners
should be able to get a lock. Nice work.
HAYES: Thank you, sir.
REED: I apologise. I over-reacted. A lot of the crew's on edge lately.
HAYES: They certainly are.
REED: I heard things got pretty ugly down there.
HAYES: It's not every day I'm asked to confine a senior officer. I
can't say I disagree with the Captain's decision. If one of my men
disobeyed orders I'd throw him in the stockade.
REED: I've got to get back to the Bridge. Let me know if your
simulation finds anything else.
 [Outside T'Pol's quarters]
 TUCKER: I need to see T'Pol.
CHANG: She's not suppose to have any visitors, sir.
TUCKER: This isn't a social call. I'm here for my neuropressure
treatment. Doctor's orders. You don't want me to bring Phlox down here,
do you?
(Chang steps aside.)
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 T'POL: What's our status?
TUCKER: The antimatter's on it's way. I had a talk with him.
Everything's going to be all right. This whole thing'll blow over in a
day or two.
T'POL: Our antimatter supply will be depleted by then. The Captain's
behaviour is becoming increasingly illogical, even for a human. He's
preoccupied with the hatchery, he's displaying signs of paranoia.
TUCKER: I think you're overstating things just a little.
T'POL: You can't allow him to use our antimatter.
TUCKER: What do you suggest I do, start a mutiny?
T'POL: You have to speak with Phlox. Ask him to run a full exam on the
Captain.
TUCKER: What good would that do?
T'POL: If the Doctor can find something wrong, we may have medical
grounds to relieve him of command.
TUCKER: Relieve him? Look, I know you're upset about what happened, but
I think you're taking this personally.
T'POL: How long before the reactor's brought online?
TUCKER: Assuming Hoshi can translate the interface, about twelve hours.
T'POL: You have to delay it until we can verify the Captain's mental
state.
TUCKER: If he finds out what we're doing, we'll both end up in the
Brig. You're asking me to betray him.
T'POL: You can't allow your personal feelings for the Captain to affect
your decision. We both know he's endangering this ship and our mission.
 [Bridge]
 REED: What is it?
TRAVIS: A subspace vortex is opening off the port bow.
REED: Tactical alert. Captain Archer, report to the Bridge.
HOSHI: It's an insectoid, three biosigns aboard.
TRAVIS: They're firing. (Enterprise rocks to the impact.) TRAVIS: They're moving
away at full impulse.
REED: Pursuit course. Arm phase cannons. Disable their engines. (Two
phase shots are fired.)
TRAVIS: No effect.
HOSHI: Their main deflector's charging. They could be trying to open a
vortex.
REED: Torpedoes. Maximum yield. Target their impulse manifolds.
OFFICER: Ready.
REED: Fire.
(One torpedo misses, the other blows it to pieces just as Archer comes
on deck.)
ARCHER: What the hell's going on?
REED: An insectoid ship, sir.
ARCHER: You destroyed them?
REED: They were opening a vortex. They would have escaped.
ARCHER: The crew might have been able to take care of the hatchery.
REED: Sir?
ARCHER: We could have kept our antimatter and continued the mission.
REED: They would have told their superiors, sir. Given away our
position.
ARCHER: If you'd explained to them why we were here, you might have
avoided a fire fight.
REED: With all due respect sir, they didn't seem particularly
interested in talking.
ARCHER: Archer to Major Hayes.
HAYES [OC]: Go ahead, Captain.
ARCHER: Report to my Ready room, on the double.
HAYES [OC]: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: I'm relieving you as Tactical officer. From now on, you'll
report to Major Hayes.
REED: I did what was necessary to protect this ship and its mission.
ARCHER: You'll be confined to quarters until further notice.
REED: Captain.
ARCHER: Dismissed.
REED: Yes, sir. (Reed leaves.)
ARCHER: Are you done with that translation?
HOSHI: Almost.
ARCHER: I want you to put together a distress call in the Insectoid
language. Transmit it on all frequencies as soon as you're ready.
HOSHI: Understood.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: There's nothing more important than the
success of this mission. Do you agree, Major?
HAYES: Of course, sir.
ARCHER: My senior officers don't seem to understand what I'm trying to
do here. I guess I have myself to blame. In the past, I've encouraged
them to ask questions, but we don't have time for that now. I need
officers who respect the chain of command and can follow orders.
HAYES: It won't be a problem, sir.
ARCHER: I thought what happened with T'Pol might have been an isolated
incident, but I'm not so sure now. Lieutenant Reed destroyed a ship
that could have helped us. I'm starting to wonder if he deliberately
tried to sabotage this mission. You're in command while I'm on the
surface. You answer to me, and me alone. Is that understood, Major?
HAYES: Perfectly, sir.
ARCHER: That'll be all.
 [Launch bay]
 TUCKER: Can we talk to you for a minute, sir? (Archer is loading canisters into Shuttlepod One.)
ARCHER: What is it?
TUCKER: I'd like you to go to Sickbay with Phlox.
ARCHER: Do I look sick to you?
TUCKER: Hoshi says you ordered her to transmit a distress call.
ARCHER: That's right.
TUCKER: Don't you think that's a little dangerous?
ARCHER: We'll be light years from here before the Xindi respond to it.
TUCKER: We don't know how far away their ships are. If we send that
message we'll be taking a hell of a risk.
ARCHER: We can't afford to play it safe anymore. This mission's too
important.
TUCKER: This mission is to save Earth, not an alien hatchery.
PHLOX: Captain, you haven't eaten or slept in almost two days. You've
shown signs of obsessional behaviour and paranoia.
ARCHER: If it'll make the two of you feel better, I'll go to Sickbay
for a complete physical as soon as that reactor's online.
TUCKER: That's not good enough, sir. Phlox has the authority to order
you to Sickbay.
ARCHER: T'Pol's manipulating you, isn't she. If I'm declared unfit for
duty, then she takes over.
PHLOX: Captain, if you won't come with me then I'll be required under
Starfleet order 104 section C to relieve you of command.
ARCHER: I expected something like this from her, but not from the two
of you. Corporal. (A MACO comes from around the corner.) ARCHER: I've already
confined two senior officers today.
(As they leave, Phlox checks the medical scanner he had hidden in his
pocket.)
 [Sickbay]
 (Looking at the results of the scan on the
overhead monitor.)
PHLOX: His neurochemistry appears normal.
TUCKER: There's nothing wrong with him?
PHLOX: This scan is hardly conclusive. I'll need to get him into the
imaging chamber and run a complete neurological series.
TUCKER: When Hoshi sends that distress call, every Xindi ship that
picks it up will start heading this way. He's got Hayes on the Bridge,
MACOs posted all over the ship. Whatever we do, we're going to have to
do it fast.
PHLOX: What are you proposing, Commander?
TUCKER: I think it's time we throw the rule book out the window.
 [Hatchery]
 CREWMAN: Captain. (Some eggs are starting to
hatch.)
 [Outside T'Pol's quarters]
 (Tucker is clutching his shoulder and looking
uncomfortable.)
CHANG: I'm sorry sir, no visitors.
TUCKER: You let me in before.
CHANG: I have new orders from Major Hayes.
TUCKER: Look, T'Pol was a little rough with me during the last session.
I think she caused some nerve damage.
CHANG: You'll have to speak with the Major, sir.
(We see Reed and Phlox sneaking down the corridor while Chang is
distracted.)
TUCKER: This is a Starfleet ship. I don't have to ask Major Hayes for
anything.
CHANG: Step away, sir. (Reed is holding a phase pistol.)
REED: Stand down, Corporal. (Phlox injects
Chang.)
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 TUCKER: The Captain gave Hayes control of the
Bridge, posted MACOs on every deck.
T'POL: Is he still on the surface?
TUCKER: Yeah.
T'POL: Retrieving him and the antimatter should be the priority.
REED: I'd advise securing the Bridge first. If Hayes gets wind of this
we could have a fire-fight on our hands.
PHLOX: Perhaps we should approach the Major and explain the situation.
He seems like a reasonable man.
REED: That would be risky. If Hayes sides with the Captain, this mutiny
will be over before it begins.
T'POL: We'll need more people. Who's on duty in the Armoury?
REED: Ensign Walsh and two of my men. They'll side with us, but Hayes
posted two MACO there.
 [Hatchery]
 (Lots of the eggs are starting to jiggle.)
ARCHER: Take the shuttlepod back to Enterprise.
CREWMAN: What about you, sir?
ARCHER: You heard me.
(The two crewmen pick up the boxes and go.)
 [Armoury]
 (T'Pol comes down the steps in a Starfleet uniform
and baseball cap, then neck pinches one MACO.)
REED: Hold it. Sorry. (He stuns at other MACO.)
TUCKER: That's going to leave a bruise. (They all arm themselves.) TUCKER: All
right? You're with me.
WALSH: Yes, sir.
(Walsh and Tucker transport themselves into the crashed ship.)
 [Corridor]
 (Seeing two MACO by the turbolift.)
REED: Well, we won't get to the Bridge this way.
(The four head to an access ladder instead.)
 [Hatchery]
 (The hatch opens and Tucker throws in a stun
grenade to knock out the MACOs in the airlock before heading into the
main chamber.) TUCKER: Captain! (There are young Insectoids
running around the floor.) TUCKER: Captain, it's Trip!
ARCHER: You shouldn't have weapons in here.
 [Bridge]
 HAYES: Go ahead.
HAWKINGS [OC]: Major, Corporal Chang's been found unconscious in
T'Pol's quarters.
HAYES: Where's T'Pol?
HAWKINGS [OC]: Not here, sir.
HAYES: Hayes to the Armoury. Armoury, respond. (He nods to the MACO at
Tactical who leaves his post, then the Bridge doors open at the side
and in the Situation room. There's a standoff between the mutineers and
the MACOs, particularly Reed and Hayes with pistols aimed at each
other's heads.)
REED: Stand down!
HAYES: You intend to shoot me, Lieutenant?
REED: Tell them to stand down.
HAYES: The Captain relieved you of duty. Both of you.
T'POL: We don't want anyone injured. Put down your weapons.
HAYES: Until the Captain says otherwise, I give the orders on this
Bridge.
 [Hatchery]
 ARCHER: Go back to the ship.
TUCKER: You have to come with us. (An Insectoid leaves it's egg and
crawls over Archer.) TUCKER: Captain!
ARCHER: Shush. It's all right. (A second baby climbs onto him, and a
third. Tucker stuns him.)
 [Bridge]
 HAYES: Contact the Captain.
T'POL: Belay that.
HAYES: I gave you a direct order, Ensign.
HOSHI: I'm sorry, Major.
(Hayes starts to back up to open a comm. channel himself, and Travis
jumps him. One Starfleet and two MACOs get stunned. Reed holds a pistol to Hayes' head.)
REED: It's over, Major. Take him to his
quarters.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
HOSHI: It's Commander Tucker.
T'POL: Put him through. Go ahead.
TUCKER [OC]: We've got the Captain. What's going on up there?
T'POL: The Bridge is secure.
 [Hatchery]
 TUCKER: Tell Phlox to get the imaging chamber
ready. We've got a patient for him.T'POL [OC]: Acting Captain's starlog,
supplemental. We've resumed our course for Azati Prime. Major Hayes and
his men have been temporarily relieved of duty. Doctor Phlox believes
he has found an explanation for the Captain's behaviour.
 [Sickbay]
 HAYES: Where is he?
PHLOX: In his quarters, resting. Do you recall when the Captain was
attacked by one of the eggs?
HAYES: It sprayed something in his face.
PHLOX: I thought it was a defence reflex, but it was actually something
far more sophisticated. The substance contained a unique neurochemical.
It infiltrated the Captain's synaptic pathways, causing him to reverse
imprint on the baby insectoids. It's the opposite of what happens when
a young animal bonds with its mother.
HAYES: Are you saying he thought he was the mother of those things?
PHLOX: Well, more likely a caretaker. Of course, the Captain didn't
realise this on a conscious level. Eventually he became obsessed with
protecting the eggs to the exclusion of everything else.
T'POL: Including our mission.
HAYES: I'd like to speak with him, if you don't mind.
PHLOX: He'll be awake in a few hours. He should be fully recovered by
then.
T'POL: I want you and your men to return to duty.
HAYES: Yes, ma'am. (T'Pol and Trip leave.) HAYES: Not the sort of thing they
trained us for at West Point.
REED: I imagine not.
HAYES: You could have come to me, explained the situation.
REED: We couldn't take the chance that you'd side with the Captain.
HAYES: I probably would have.
REED: Yeah.
 [Archer's quarters]
 (The room is darkened, Archer is dozing with
Porthos by his side when the doorbell chimes.)
ARCHER: Come in.
TUCKER: I didn't mean to wake you, sir.
ARCHER: It's all right, I was getting up anyway.
TUCKER: How are you feeling?
ARCHER: Oh, I've been better. Are you sure you had that pistol set to
stun?
TUCKER: Captain. I hope you understand, if there'd been any other way
ARCHER: You were protecting our mission, Trip. I would have done the
same thing.
TUCKER: Still, I never thought I'd find myself pointing a weapon at
you, no matter what the circumstances.
ARCHER: Let's put this behind us, okay?
TUCKER: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: What's our status?
TUCKER: We just recovered the last of our antimatter reserves.
ARCHER: The hatchlings?
TUCKER: Phlox says there's nineteen of them running around down there.
Chances are they'll survive until the next Xindi ship comes along.
ARCHER: It's time we got back on the road. I want you at your post.
We're going to be pushing the engines pretty hard. I'll be on the
Bridge.
TUCKER: Aren't you supposed to get some rest?
ARCHER: I've had plenty.
TUCKER: I'm sorry, sir, but the Doctor was insistent.
ARCHER: Okay. I guess I don't want another mutiny on my hands. Tell
Travis to set a course for Azati Prime, maximum warp.
TUCKER: Right away, sir.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Azati Prime
Azati
Prime
 Original Airdate: 3 Mar, 2004
  [Bridge]
 (Enterprise has arrived at a red giant solar
system.)
ARCHER: One quarter impulse.
T'POL:: There appears to be considerable activity around two of the
inner planets. Numerous ships, all Xindi.
REED: I'm picking up a large array of satellites. They're generating a
detection grid.
ARCHER: Degra mentioned a security net.
REED: Seems like we've come to the right place.
ARCHER: The planetoid we passed on the way in, put us on the other side
of it.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
T'POL: A convoy of ships is approaching the detection grid.
ARCHER: Let's see them. (A mixture of Reptilian and Humanoid designs.)
ARCHER: Magnify the lead ship. Show me the warp signature. Degra.
 [Degra's ship]
 (Drinks are being poured.)
DEGRA: It may seem odd to celebrate the completion of a weapon,
particularly one designed to destroy an entire planet, but recall the
words of Enarchis written some fifty years into the Great Diaspora.
Without a world of our own we are but children lost in the wilderness.
One day we'll emerge from this wilderness, and our work here will
ensure that we'll never be lost again. To a new era for all Xindi.
(They toast the sentiment.)
 [Council ship]
 (It is of reptilian design.)
ARBOREAL: Degra, it is good to see you again.
DEGRA: Welcome.
REPTILIAN: When can we get underway?
DEGRA: Momentarily. Patience.
REPTILIAN: Patience is for the dead.
ARBOREAL: You've accomplished a great deal in a very short time.
HUMANOID: We owe you our gratitude.
REPTILIAN: It's too early to speak of accomplishments. I'll reserve my
gratitude for when the humans have been annihilated.
 [Situation room]
 REED: I've analysed every link in the grid. I
can't find a single weakness.
T'POL: The grid is extremely sensitive. We'd be detected the instant we
passed through.
TUCKER: We could try disabling it.
T'POL: It utilises thousands of satellites. If one of them goes out of
commission, it fills the gap.
ARCHER: What about the insectoid shuttle?
REED: Make like one of the locals?
ARCHER: We could fly in, try to locate where the weapon's being
completed.
T'POL: Their shuttle might be able to get through the grid without
raising suspicion.
TRAVIS: Captain, we're not exactly experts at piloting that thing.
TUCKER: It's going to take at least a couple of hours to get up to
speed.
ARCHER: Take them. I want to launch as soon as we can.
 [Insectoid shuttle]
 (Hovering in the launch bay.)
TRAVIS: I think I've found reverse.
TUCKER: Great, but unless we plan to fly in ass first we'd better
figure out how to make it go forward.
TRAVIS: Can't argue with that.
TUCKER: Let's cycle through these console settings again. Try the port
actuator.
TRAVIS: Closed.
 [Bridge]
 (Hoshi is working on the Insectoid language.)
T'POL: Commander Tucker is going to need time to install the
translation matrix.
HOSHI: If Commander Tucker wants to speak insectoid I have to get this
right first. (She plays a sequence of clicks and hisses.) HOSHI: Believe it or
not, that was have a nice day, or it's equivalent.
 [Insectoid shuttle]
 ARCHER: Just get in there, find this thing, scan
it and get out. Remember, whatever information you gather won't do us
any good unless you bring it back.
TUCKER: We'll keep that in mind.
ARCHER: Good luck.
TUCKER: Thank you, sir.
TRAVIS: Thanks, Captain.
(the shuttle launches. It's a rough ride with beeps going off)
TUCKER: Trouble?
TRAVIS: It's like steering an asteroid miner with a bad axis coil.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Their flightpath is somewhat erratic.
(The little shuttle turns towards Enterprise.)
ARCHER: Open a channel. Trip? (The shuttle scrapes Enterprise's hull.)
 [Insectoid shuttle]
 TUCKER: Sorry!
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: No problem. I'll send you the bill.
 [Insectoid shuttle]
 (The ride smoothes out.)
TRAVIS: I think I'm getting a feel for her.
TUCKER: Sensors are up and running. Let's get this show on the road.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Keep a sensor lock for as long as you can.
 [Insectoid shuttle]
 TUCKER: Five hundred metres, two hundred. Here we
go.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: They're passing through the grid.
 [insectoid shuttle]
 TUCKER: We're in. Xindi patrol ship, coming up
from behind. They're hailing us.
TRAVIS: Doesn't exactly sound like welcome to the neighbourhood.
TUCKER: Hoshi, don't fail us now.
XINDI [OC]: Your presence inside the detection grid is unauthorised.
Explain.
TUCKER: We had a slight navigational malfunction that threw us off
course. It's been corrected.
XINDI [OC]: Rendezvous with your carrier ship immediately.
TUCKER: Understood.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: The detection grid is creating too much
interference. I've lost them.
REED: We're being scanned.
ARCHER: Where's it coming from?
REED: I'm not picking up any vessels in the vicinity.
T'POL: From the moon's surface. A small monitoring station. The moon's
rotation brought it into scanning range.
ARCHER: Let's see it. Malcolm.
T'POL: I'm reading three Xindi biosigns.
ARCHER: Have they sent out a transmission?
T'POL: Not yet.
REED: What are they waiting for?
T'POL: Probably for the moon's rotation to bring them back into
communication range.
ARCHER: How long?
T'POL: Four hours.
ARCHER: Target the facility.
REED: Lock.
T'POL: Sir.
ARCHER: We can't risk it. Fire.
(A single torpedo obliterates it.)
 [Insectoid shuttle]
 TUCKER: I'm still getting trace kemocite readings,
but not enough to indicate a large-scale weapon.
TRAVIS: There's not much land down there.
TUCKER: And what land there is doesn't have any life on it. Take us
down, Travis, closer to the surface. Adjust twenty degrees starboard.
TRAVIS: See something?
TUCKER: I think so. (A dark mass in the water.)
TRAVIS: You did say that most of this thing's power was routed to
structural integrity.
TUCKER: And you said we could probably fly it inside a gas giant. Hell,
it's only water. (They dive in.)
TRAVIS: Structural integrity's holding.
TUCKER: Take us deeper. Negative z axis ten degrees.
(they fly down a canyon to see something round, and huge, with lots of
ships around it)
TRAVIS: Are you getting those scans, sir?
TUCKER: There's a lot of activity on the right lower hemisphere. I want
to have a look inside.
TRAVIS: The Captain said get in and get out.
TUCKER: That's exactly what we're going to do.
TRAVIS: Aye, aye.
 [Command centre]
 (Showing off their scans.)
TUCKER: It's definitely in the final phases of construction. Most of
the work that's going on seems maintenance related.
REED: I've gone over the scans you brought back. That's the explosive
matrix. If we can get close enough we can set off a chain reaction that
will blow this thing to high heaven.
T'POL: The initial explosion would need to be of considerable yield.
REED: A couple of photonic torpedoes should do the trick.
TUCKER: There's room in the shuttle.
ARCHER: We're talking about a one-way trip.
TRAVIS: I should be the one to go.
ARCHER: Forget it.
TRAVIS: I'm the only one who can pilot that shuttle.
TUCKER: I practiced on those controls. I can get her in.
TRAVIS: But I've actually done it.
TUCKER: Captain, you want a senior officer on this, don't you?
ARCHER: I'll be flying the mission.
TUCKER: Captain?
ARCHER: How soon can you get it ready?
TUCKER: A couple of hours to get the torpedoes in place.
ARCHER: Get started. Meet me in the Launch Bay in thirty minutes. I'm
going to need some flying lessons.
TRAVIS: Aye sir.
(Archer leaves, goes down corridor, through into a turbolift and finds
himself in... )
 [Enterprise J Observation Lounge]
 DANIELS: Welcome aboard, Captain.
ARCHER: Daniels. Where am I?
DANIELS: You're on Enterprise. Enterprise J to be exact, a distant
relative of your ship. We're four hundred years in the future.
(There's a battle going on outside in a murky purple haze.)
ARCHER: I'm going to assume you brought me here for a good reason.
DANIELS: Look out there. It extends fifty thousand light years in all
directions, and it is growing.
ARCHER: I've seen it before.
DANIELS: I know, in the Expanse.
ARCHER: You know about the alien we found, the test subject?
DANIELS: He belongs to the same race that built the Spheres. They're
altering this space to make it habitable for their species. It's a
prelude to invasion.
ARCHER: We came to the same conclusion.
DANIELS: It's getting harder and harder to surprise you, Captain. (the
ship shakes from an impact) I've brought you to a monumental moment in
history, the battle of Procyon Five, where the Federation engaged the
Sphere Builders.
ARCHER: The Federation? You've mentioned them before.
DANIELS: Vulcans, Andorians, Ithenites, Klingons. Dozens of species,
including humans, all unified in a powerful alliance. Sphere Builders.
(The large ship is blown to smithereens.) DANIELS: The Federation wins the
battle, they drive the enemy back into their trans-dimensional realm.
If the Federation had lost, the Sphere Builders would have spread
throughout the galaxy. They would have wiped out everything. This
species has technology which allows them to examine alternate
timelines. They've seen this future and they want to change the
outcome, so they contacted the Xindi and convinced them that humanity
was a dangerous threat.
ARCHER: They want the Xindi to destroy us.
DANIELS: Without humanity, the Federation will never exist. You have to
make the Xindi understand that humanity isn't the enemy. In fact, it's
humanity that will protect them from the Sphere Builders when this
battle is won. Contact them. Make peace.
ARCHER: They're about to deploy their weapon.
DANIELS: I know.
ARCHER: I can't let that happen.
DANIELS: If you destroy their weapon they will only build another. You
are the only one who can convince them of what I have told you. It is
crucial to history that you do not sacrifice yourself.
ARCHER: My concern is with preventing the deaths of billions of people.
If that's a problem for history, then history will have to suffer.
DANIELS: Send someone else.
ARCHER: I won't do that!
DANIELS: Captain, you have to believe me. You are making a catastrophic
mistake.
ARCHER: You've made your share of mistakes.
DANIELS: This isn't one of them.
ARCHER: Send me back. Send me back now!
DANIELS: Take this. (A coin-sized disc.) DANIELS: It's Xindi. A family medal that
belongs to one of the crewmen on this ship. There are Xindi serving
aboard Enterprise J.
ARCHER: Why are you giving this to me?
DANIELS: In case you change your mind.
ARCHER: I won't.
 [Corridor]
 T'POL: I'll have this quantum dated.
ARCHER: We both know it's from the future.
T'POL: What do you intend to do?
ARCHER: I'm going ahead with the mission. You don't think I should.
T'POL: He said you're the only one who can end the conflict with the
Xindi. You can't do that if you're dead.
ARCHER: That's if you accept Daniels' version of the future.
T'POL: He's in a position to know.
ARCHER: I thought you were the sceptical one when it came to time
travel.
T'POL: Our recent visit to Detroit has tempered my scepticism. You
should reconsider your decision.
ARCHER: What am I supposed to do? Fly a shuttle into the system and
knock on the door, tell the Xindi we want to talk? The weapon is too
close to being launched. If the situation were different maybe I'd
consider it, but I can't.
T'POL: I don't want you to die. It's not necessary.
ARCHER: I wish that were true.
 [Degra's ship]
 REPTILIAN: I want four ships to accompany the
weapon.
DEGRA: We'll have to generate an extremely large vortex to accommodate
that many vessels.
REPTILIAN: Even after Earth is destroyed, there will be residual
presence in the system. I intend to hunt down and eradicate every
refugee caravan, every colony, every last outpost they have.
DEGRA: A vortex of that size will be very unstable. You could lose one
or more vessels.
REPTILIAN: See that we don't.
(The comm. system beeps.)
DEGRA: A message for you.
REPTILIAN: Go ahead.
VOICE [OC}: Commander, we've lost contact with one of the lunar
outposts.
REPTILIAN: How long ago?
VOICE [OC]: Two hours.
REPTILIAN: Send a patrol. We will resume this when I return. (leaves)
ARBOREAL: Someone once said that dealing with reptilians is like
bargaining with the sun. You make no progress, and you come away
burned.
DEGRA: It's not him.
ARBOREAL: The last time I saw you like this was when you delivered the
first weapon.
DEGRA: That one only killed seven million. This one will destroy an
entire world.
ARBOREAL: Better their world than ours.
DEGRA: That's what I keep telling myself, but the reality is that a
good number of the dead will be innocents, and children.
ARBOREAL It's best not to think about it.
DEGRA: It's difficult when you have children of your own.
ARBOREAL: What we do is for them, for our children's future. Remember
that.
DEGRA: I wonder how they'll remember us.
 [Xindi shuttle]
 TRAVIS: I know these controls aren't exactly
intuitive.
ARCHER: I think they were built for someone with compound eyes.
TRAVIS: Try again. Good, you're starting to think like an insectoid.
ARCHER: I'll take that as a compliment.
TRAVIS: Can I ask you something?
ARCHER: Go ahead.
TRAVIS: You're the least expendable man on Enterprise. Why are you
doing this?
ARCHER: An hour ago I gave the command to kill three Xindi in cold
blood. A month ago I had Phlox create a living being in order to use
some of it's tissue, then I watched him put it to death.
TRAVIS: Sounds like you're saying this is some sort of penance.
ARCHER: I'm saying I won't order anyone else to die.
 [Sickbay]
 (Archer enters with Porthos under one arm, and his
basket and bowl under the other.)
ARCHER: I hate to add to this menagerie of yours, Doc.
PHLOX: Nonsense. What's one more mouth to feed?
ARCHER: Just don't harvest any part of him.
PHLOX: I doubt that would be necessary.
ARCHER: Do me a favour. Slip him a piece of cheese
every now and then.
PHLOX: Certainly.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: I've always been much better at avoiding
farewells than giving them, so I'm not even going to try, but I'm going
to ask all of you to think back to the day when this ship was first
launched. We were explorers then. When all this is over, when Earth is
safe, I want you to get back to that job. There are four hundred
billion stars in our galaxy. We've only explored a tiny fraction. You
have a lot of work to do. Of all the Captains who will sit in this
chair, I can't imaging any of them being more proud than I am right
now.
(The shuttle is launched.)
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Enterprise. I'm heading in.
(A little later.)
REED: Four hundred metres, two hundred. He's passing through the grid.
He's in.
TUCKER: Give 'em hell, Captain.
T'POL: I'll be in the Ready room. (Where she has a little cry.)
 [Insectoid shuttle]
 (Unchallenged, he dives into the ocean and heads
for his target.)
VOICE [OC]: Unauthorised vessel, power down immediately.
(Another ship comes up behind him and starts firing.)
 [Ready room]
 T'POL: Come in.
TUCKER: Still nothing.
T'POL: I'm aware of that.
TUCKER: It's been over two hours. He should have reached the weapon by
now. Travis and I got there in twenty five minutes, and we didn't know
where to look. Do you think it's possible our sensors could have missed
the explosion?
T'POL: Doubtful.
TUCKER: Whatever you're doing, can't it wait?
T'POL: For what?
TUCKER: Right now your place is on the Bridge.
T'POL: I'll be notified if my presence is needed.
TUCKER: No matter what happens to the Xindi weapon, the Captain isn't
coming back. You're in command now. The crew needs to know you're on
top of things and it doesn't help if you're holed up in here.
T'POL: I don't need any leadership advice.
TUCKER: I'm just trying to help. This isn't easy for any of us. T'Pol?
T'POL: Dismissed.
TUCKER: Dismissed?
T'POL: Get out.
 [Reptilian ship brig]
 (Archer is being interrogated by three Reptilians, one of whom is hitting him. Archer's hands are chained above his head.)
REPTILIAN: Answer the question.
ARCHER: Repeat the question.
REPTILIAN: How many Earth vessels have entered the Expanse?
ARCHER: I wish I could help you, but my superiors keep me in the dark
about these things. (He gets hit again.)
REPTILIAN: Is this a pre-emptive strike?
ARCHER: I thought that was your specialty.
REPTILIAN: You don't want to know my specialty.
ARCHER: Let me guess. Stinking up the room?
REPTILIAN: I had no idea that humans were so resilient. It's not a
trait found in most primate species.
ARCHER: Including the Xindi?
REPTILIAN: There's a reason reptilians are called upon when force must
be applied. It was a reptilian who piloted the weapon that attacked
your world.
ARCHER: Friend of yours?
REPTILIAN: He was from my regiment. I selected him myself.
ARCHER: You must be very proud.
REPTILIAN: His name will go down in history. It will be spoken with
reverence, a testament to the superiority of the cold-blooded.
ARCHER: I'll bet you didn't know this, but at one time most of my world
was ruled by reptiles.
REPTILIAN: I wasn't aware of that.
ARCHER: A comet hit, around sixty five million years ago, caused a mass
extinction. Most of the reptiles died out. Mammals became the dominant
species.
REPTILIAN: How unfortunate.
ARCHER: Still, the reptiles might have come out on top if it hadn't
been for a slight disadvantage.
REPTILIAN: And what was that?
ARCHER: They had brains the size of a walnut. That's very small.
Apparently it's a constant in the universe.
REPTILIAN: (trying very hard not to throttle him there and then) Earth
vessels. How many?
ARCHER: The reptiles didn't all die out. Some evolved into snakes,
alligators, turtles. As a matter of fact one of my favourite
restaurants in San Francisco makes the most wonderful turtle soup. You
should try it sometime if you're ever in the area.
REPTILIAN: You want me to kill you?
ARCHER: I'm just making conversation. Relaying a few interesting facts
about the world you're trying to destroy.
REPTILIAN: I'll reciprocate with an interesting fact of my own. We know
exactly where your ship is.
ARCHER: Is that so?
REPTILIAN: When we lost contact with our lunar outpost, we scanned the
vicinity and discovered it hiding. Unless you tell me exactly what I
want to know I'll dispatch a squadron right now. No more conversation?
I hope you had a chance to say goodbye to your crew.
ARCHER: All right, but I'll only talk to Degra.
REPTILIAN: Degra?
ARCHER: Alone.
REPTILIAN: I don't know who that is.
ARCHER: He's building your weapon. Ring a bell now?
REPTILIAN: What makes you think Degra would be interested in talking to
you?
ARCHER: Just tell him the name of his third child, Trenia.
REPTILIAN: Degra has only two children.
ARCHER: Prove me wrong. Tell him.
 [Situation room]
 T'POL: Sensors would have easily detected an
explosion of that magnitude, even underwater.
TUCKER: I say we go in. Get as close as we can and try to take out the
weapon.
REED: Agreed.
T'POL: This system is heavily guarded. Our chances for reaching the
weapon are non-existent.
TUCKER: We can't just sit here.
REED: What do you propose we do?
T'POL: There's still a chance the Captain may succeed.
REED: The longer we wait here, the greater the likelihood we'll be
spotted.
T'POL: If we don't hear from the Captain in one hour, I'll pilot a
shuttlepod into the system.
TUCKER: And do what?
T'POL: Attempt a diplomatic solution.
TUCKER: You've got to be kidding.
REED: You can't possibly believe that has any chance of success.
T'POL: The odds aren't promising, but the fact that I'm Vulcan may help
me establish a dialogue.
REED: You'll just be captured or killed.
T'POL: Perhaps, but at the moment I don't see an alternate course of
action.
 [Reptilian ship brig]
 ARCHER: Hello again.
DEGRA: How do you know me?
ARCHER: Long story.
DEGRA: Repeat what you told him.
ARCHER: The name of your third child is Trenia.
DEGRA: Leave me alone with him, and take him as well. (reptilians all
leave)
ARCHER: Three months into the pregnancy your wife contracted Anaprolean
fever. You lost the child. You were going to name it Trenia.
DEGRA: I've never told that to anyone.
ARCHER: You told it to me. You also talked about the weapon you
designed, the one that killed seven million people. When you watched
the telemetry come in you wondered how many of those seven million were
children.
DEGRA: Who are you?
ARCHER: It doesn't matter who I am or how I know all this. What's
important is that you listen to what I have to say.
DEGRA: Continue.
ARCHER: Your reason for building this weapon is based on a lie.
DEGRA: What lie would that be?
ARCHER: That at some point in the future humans are going to destroy
your species.
DEGRA: That is not a lie!
ARCHER: You know about the Spheres.
DEGRA: Of course.
ARCHER: They were constructed by trans-dimensional beings. Their
purpose is to reconfigure the Expanse to make it habitable for their
species. That's what destroys the Xindi, not humanity.
DEGRA: I've studied the Spheres. There is no evidence to support what
you're saying.
ARCHER: I've seen it happen. I've been to the future. Four hundred
years into the future.
DEGRA: You expect me to believe that?
ARCHER: There's an artefact in my right pocket. Take it. Go ahead.
DEGRA: (unzipping the pocket on Archer's sleeve) An initiation medal.
ARCHER: Have it quantum dated. The results will back me up.
DEGRA: You could have gotten it anywhere.
ARCHER: Listen to me, you son of a bitch. It wasn't any easier for me
to swallow this than it is for you, but you'd better understand
something. If you destroy Earth, you won't just be eliminating my
species, you'll be eliminating your own.
 [Degra's ship]
 DEGRA: The quantum dating confirms it. It's from
the future.
HUMANOID: That doesn't prove the human's telling the truth.
ARBOREAL If there's any truth in what he's saying, it means we can't
trust her.
DEGRA: It also means she's been dealing with the Reptilians secretly.
HUMANOID: Archer told you this?
DEGRA: He said he saw Reptilians on Earth, in a place called Detroit,
over a hundred years in the past.
ARBOREAL: The past.
HUMANOID: So now he's a time traveller!
DEGRA: According to the human, they were developing a bioweapon.
ARBOREAL: The Council prohibited that.
DEGRA: He spoke of it in great detail. If the Reptilians wanted to keep
their actions a secret, the past would be a good place to do it.
ARBOREAL: How would they get to the past?
DEGRA: She may have taken them.
ARBOREAL: We have to investigate this.
DEGRA: And quickly. The weapon's been moved to a safe location, but
it's nearly ready to be deployed.
HUMANOID: The Council must be informed.
ARBOREAL: Reptilians sit on the Council, or have you forgotten. If they
did go behind our backs we shouldn't reveal what we've learned. Not
yet.
HUMANOID: What about the aquatics?
ARBOREAL: We can inform them in secret.
HUMANOID: All of this collusion is dangerous. The Council is
fracturing. We can't forget who the real enemy is.
DEGRA: We may not know who the real enemy is.
 [Corridor]
 TUCKER: What happens if you fail? Are we supposed
to just keep sending people in until there's no one left?
T'POL: That's hardly a viable option. We only have one more shuttlepod.
TUCKER: You're missing my point.
 [Launch bay]
 TUCKER: I don't think you're doing this to make
peace, I think you want to try and save the Captain.
T'POL: You 're wrong.
TUCKER: Why do I get the feeling you haven't thought this through?
T'POL: You have made your objection clear. Now return to the Bridge.
TUCKER: I'm not just going to sit still and watch you fly off and die.
T'POL: I gave you an order.
TUCKER: T'Pol.
T'POL: Let go of me!
TUCKER: I won't let you do this.
T'POL: I said, let go!
TUCKER: What the hell's wrong with you?
REED [OC]: Bridge to T'Pol.
T'POL: Go ahead.
REED [OC]: There's no need to go to the Xindi. It appears they're
coming to us.
 [Bridge]
 REED: Four Xindi vessels, closing fast.
T'POL: Hail them.
HOSHI: No response.
REED: They're charging weapons.
 [Reptilian ship brig]
 HUMANOID: What exactly are you proposing? (Archer is unchained.)
ARCHER: That we trust each other.
HUMANOID: You were captured behind the controls of a ship armed with
explosives, and you're asking for our trust?
ARCHER: You're building a weapon that could destroy my world. I had to
try and stop you.
HUMANOID: And now that your mission's failed, you want to negotiate.
ARCHER: Just consider what I said.
HUMANOID: You maintain that by destroying your world we'll be ensuring
our own annihilation.
ARCHER: That's right.
HUMANOID: Because it's humankind that ultimately saves the Xindi from
these Sphere Builders.
ARCHER: We're both fighting the wrong enemy.
HUMANOID: I'm afraid it'll take more than this antique to convince us.
DEGRA: Quantum dating has produced inaccurate results before.
ARCHER: Do you believe these results are inaccurate? Let me speak to
this Council of yours, present my case.
DEGRA: Some members of the Council would sooner execute you than
listen.
ARCHER: Then help me change their minds.
HUMANOID: You haven't changed ours.
ARCHER: I've made an impression, or you wouldn't still be here.
 [Bridge]
 (Enterprise is under heavy attack from Reptilian
ships.)
REED: We've lost hull plating.
TRAVIS: I still don't have helm control.
T'POL: T'Pol to Engineering. (There are explosions going on down there.)
T'POL: Engineering, report.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: That last hit took out the starboard
nacelle. We're dead in the water. Bridge! Bridge!
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: Comm.'s down.
T'POL: Get it back. (Explosions, collapsing superstructure including
the central dome. Travis gets out of the way just in time.)
 [Reptilian ship brig]
 REPTILIAN: Restrain him.
DEGRA: We're not finished.
REPTILIAN: You've had enough time. (he chaina Archer up again.) REPTILIAN: Has he
revealed the location of his forces?
DEGRA: We've been discussing other matters.
REPTILIAN: There are no other matters. Take them back to their ship.
DEGRA: We're not going anywhere. You can't threaten us.
REPTILIAN: Return to your ship.
DEGRA: What about him?
REPTILIAN: He's going to a detention centre for more questioning. If
there are any survivors from his ship, they'll join him.
ARCHER: Survivors?
REPTILIAN: Your ship's under attack.
DEGRA: You agreed to hold off.
REPTILIAN: We grew tired of waiting.
DEGRA: Call off your vessels.
REPTILIAN: I don't answer to you.
HUMANOID: I'll assemble the Council.
REPTILIAN: By the time you do, the Earth ship will be dust.
 [Bridge]
 (The attack is still continuing and there are
fires burning.)
REED: We've got hull breaches on C, D and E.
T'POL: Close them off.
REED: The bulkheads aren't responding. We're venting atmosphere.
 [Engineering]
(Tucker uses an extinguisher on a burning
crewman.)  TUCKER: Get him to Sickbay!
CREWMAN: Yes, sir.
TUCKER: Tucker to the Bridge. If you can hear me, I've got coolant
leaks all over the place. We're evacuating. Everybody out!
(As the Xindi continue to cut Enterprise into pieces, bodies float out
of hull breaches and T'Pol sits wide-eyed and silent, waiting for the
end.)

The Enterprise Transcripts - Damage
Damage
 Original Airdate: 21 Apr, 2004
  ARCHER
[OC]: Previously on Enterprise
T'POL: (remembering the insane Vulcans) This is going to happen to me.
It's already started. I can feel my control slipping away!ARCHER
[Situation room]: We're talking about a one-way trip. (An Insectoid shuttle
launches and dives into the ocean.) ARCHER: [OC]  I'll be flying the mission. I won't
order anyone else to die.
ARCHER [Reptilian Brig]: (to Degra) You know about the Spheres. They were constructed by
trans-dimensional beings. Their purpose is to reconfigure the Expanse
to make it habitable for their species. That's what destroys the Xindi,
not humanity.
REPTILIAN: We know exactly where your ship is.
(Enterprise is under attack, with holes in the hull and bodies floating out.)
 [Bridge]
 REED: Another breach on C deck, E deck's
depressurising. We can't take much more of this.
(the shaking and jolting stops, it goes very quiet)
REED: They've ceased firing. They're moving off, back into the system. (T'Pol checks Reed's station readings.)
T'POL: Ensign, get us out of here.
TRAVIS: Thrusters are down. I don't think we're going anywhere.
 [Degra's ship]
 REPTILIAN: You had no right to recall my ships.
DEGRA: And you had no authorisation to launch an attack.
REPTILIAN: The humans should have been destroyed the moment they were
detected.
HUMANOID: The Council doesn't agree.
REPTILIAN: You're permitting an enemy vessel to remain in orbit near a
military installation!
DEGRA: Their ship is critically damaged. They no longer pose a threat.
REPTILIAN: Thanks to an attack that you opposed. At the very least, we
should board their vessel and take them prisoner.
ARBOREAL: It is being considered.
HUMANOID: On the subject of prisoners, the Council wants Archer for
further interrogation.
REPTILIAN: We're not finished with him.
DEGRA: You've questioned him long enough.
REPTILIAN: He hasn't provided us with the necessary information.
HUMANOID: Perhaps the Council will have more success. You're ordered to
release him immediately.
REPTILIAN: Very well.
DEGRA: We've arranged for his transport.
REPTILIAN: We can deliver him.
DEGRA: He's already been severely beaten under your care.
REPTILIAN: He is the commander of an enemy vessel.
HUMANOID: We need Archer in good condition.
DEGRA: If he can't answer questions, we can't interrogate him.
REPTILIAN: He will not be harmed any further. You have my assurances.
DEGRA: That isn't good enough.
REPTILIAN: Meaning?
DEGRA: It wouldn't be the first of your assurances that fell short.
ARBOREAL: The Council has agreed that the aquatics will transport the
prisoner. They've sent a ship. Get him ready.
 [Corridor]
 REED: The comm. system's still down. We don't have
a complete casualty list yet. So far the news isn't good. Five people
are confirmed dead, a dozen wounded. Most of the hull breaches have
been contained with emergency bulkheads.
T'POL: What about Cargo Bay two?
REED: I don't know. There's no way to get to it. A large portion of E
deck is still decompressed.
T'POL: Weapons?
REED: The aft torpedo launcher's working, but that's about it. I really
don't know what's holding us together, but let's hope it doesn't give
out.
 [Engineering]
 T'POL: Commander.
TUCKER: The primary warp coil's fried. It has to be rebuilt from
scratch.
T'POL: How long?
TUCKER: A couple of weeks, if we had the parts. We don't. As it stands
now, warp drive's out of the question.
T'POL: Impulse?
TUCKER: I'll have to inspect the hull around the exhaust manifolds, see
the damage first-hand.
T'POL: Make it a priority.
TUCKER: We've had a lot of injuries down here. It could speed things up
if you assign me some extra help. (Another bang makes a nervous T'Pol
jump out of her skin.) TUCKER: Engineering isn't the safest place to be right
now.
REED: Indeed. We've already lost one Captain today.
 [Aquatic's ship]
 (Archer awakes, unbound, lying on the floor of a
small bare room with a porthole. One wall gives him a view into the
water-filled main ship. He attracts the attention of an Aquatic.)
ARCHER: Where are you taking me?
(The Aquatic presses a button, and Archer passes out again.)
 [Bridge]
 REED: Emergency power's back online. We'll have
phase cannons in about an hour.
T'POL: I'd like you to begin repairs on E deck.
REED: I'll have to pull people from other areas.
T'POL: There are engineering components in Cargo Bay two. They're
crucial to Commander Tucker's repairs.
REED: Aye.
TRAVIS: There's a vessel approaching.
REED: It's Xindi.
T'POL: Aft torpedoes.
REED: Targeting.
T'POL: The viewscreen?
TRAVIS: Still offline.
REED: It appears to be a one-man vessel. No armaments.
T'POL: Biosigns?
REED: One.
T'POL: Bring it in.
 [Launch bay]
 (Two armed MACOs, Reed and T'Pol go to see what is
in the little vessel. Reed scans for a hatch control.)
REED: Here. (It opens it to reveal -
Archer.)
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: No internal injuries. Numerous contusions
consistent with blunt trauma.
ARCHER: How many have we lost?
PHLOX: Fourteen. Three are unaccounted for.
ARCHER: Don't waste time on me.
PHLOX: It's good to see you again, Captain. (goes to tend to others on
biobeds)
T'POL: Damage report. (hands over a PADD) We'll have impulse power in
six hours. (Archer stares at two bodies on the floor, covered by
blankets.) T'POL: Aft torpedo launchers and one forward phase cannon are
online.
ARCHER: Have Hoshi and Travis start analysing that pod.
T'POL: Its configuration suggests it's aquatic.
ARCHER: I was aboard one of their ships. That's the last thing I
remember.
T'POL: Do you have any idea why they released you?
ARCHER: I think I may have gotten through to one of them. Degra. (T'Pol
hands him a towel. Her hand is shaking so he holds it.) ARCHER: Thanks. Are you
all right?
T'POL: I'm fine. I should help Lieutenant Reed with his repairs.
(Her journey through the corridors however, has a sound and vision
distorted, horror film quality to it. She gets to her quarters and
bathes her face.)
 [Situation room]
 REED: They went to a lot of trouble to let you go.
Do you really think they'll attack us again?
ARCHER: They're not exactly unified. The reptilians came after us on
their own. They might decide to finish what they started.
REED: We've run out of moons to hide behind, but there is a cometary
dust cloud not too far off.
ARCHER: T'Pol?
T'POL: The diamagnetic field should shield us from long range scans.
ARCHER: How far away is it?
CREWMAN [OC]: Engineering to the Bridge. We just picked up a surge in
the EPS grid on A deck. (Bang! Everyone ducks and rubble lands on the
central display console.)
ARCHER: Thanks for the warning. How far?
REED: At present speed, about three days.
ARCHER: Set a course.
TRAVIS: Aye sir.
TUCKER: Instead of hiding, shouldn't we be looking for the weapon?
T'POL: Our sensors are still offline.
ARCHER: Let's focus on getting ourselves operational. We can't mount a
search with a ship coming down on our heads.
 [Launch bay]
 HOSHI: I thought Insectoid was tough.
TRAVIS: Almost sounds like music.
HOSHI: My mother always wanted me to take piano lessons. I should have
listened to her.
TRAVIS: It's never too late. You can start when we get home. We're
getting home.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: What makes you think we can trust this
guy?
ARCHER: Who?
TUCKER: Degra. He seems like the last person who'd come around to our
side. I mean, he designed the weapon.
ARCHER: He may not be on our side, but I get the feeling he's starting
to question his.
TUCKER: Well, let's hope you're right. I think we're ready to fire this
up. (Bang!) Maybe not.
T'POL [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: There's an unidentified vessel approaching. They're asking
for our assistance.
ARCHER: Any details?
T'POL [OC]: Just that they've taken heavy damage.
TUCKER: Join the club.
ARCHER: How long till they get here?
T'POL [OC]: Twelve minutes.
ARCHER: Set a rendezvous course. Maybe we can help each other.
 [Bridge]
 REED: They have minimal weapons, all powered down.
T'POL: I'm detecting numerous spatial anomalies in the area.
ARCHER: Can you get us through them?
T'POL: I believe so.
ARCHER: Hail them. This is Captain Archer. We're responding to your
distress call.
ILLYRIAN [OC]: Thank you for coming, but be aware. This region contains
dangerous spatial distortions.
ARCHER: We've run into them before.
ILLYRIAN [OC]: They've damaged our engines and life support. We would
appreciate whatever assistance you can give us.
ARCHER: We'll see what we can do.
 [Corridor]
 (The Illyrian ship is almost as big as Enterprise,
and docked alongside.)
ARCHER: What brings you to this system?
ILLYRIAN: (humanoid) Curiosity. We're studying the red giant. It's the
first one we've had the opportunity to explore. We weren't prepared for
these spatial anomalies as you call them. Seems you weren't either.
ARCHER: Actually, this is all the result of combat.
ILLYRIAN: Combat?
ARCHER: Have you heard of a species called the Xindi?
ILLYRIAN: No. We're new to this region of space.
ARCHER: Let's talk about your ship. We know a way to insulate against
the anomalies. There's a substance called trellium-D.
ILLYRIAN: I've heard of it. It's extremely rare.
ARCHER: I have sixty kilos sitting in my cargo bay.
ILLYRIAN: Perhaps we can work out some sort of trade.
ARCHER: That's what I had in mind.
ILLYRIAN: Given the condition of my vessel, I don't know what we can
offer you.
ARCHER: Our warp engine is badly damaged.
ILLYRIAN: We could probably spare a few plasma injectors, maybe some
antimatter.
ARCHER: I was thinking more along the lines of a warp coil.
ILLYRIAN: I'm afraid that's one thing we can't spare.
ARCHER: Maybe we can make it worth your while. We have certain
technology that you'd probably find useful.
ILLYRIAN: Without a warp coil, the journey back to our system would
take three years. We're not equipped for a voyage of that length.
ARCHER: The Xindi have already wiped out seven million of my people.
Now they're building a weapon to destroy our entire world. I have to
stop them. Without warp drive, I won't succeed.
ILLYRIAN: I sympathise, Captain. I will help you in any other way, but
I won't jeopardize the lives of my crew. I'm sorry.
(The Illyrian ship flies off.)
 (T'Pol dreams that she and Tucker are kissing
passionately in the shower, when she turns into a Zombie Vulcan from
'Impulse' and attacks him. She wakes up distressed, gets an environment
suit and heads off through the vacuum of E deck to a very wrecked Cargo
Bay two. She falls trying to get to the lower level and her air supply
disconnects. Panicking, she manages to reconnect it and then goes to
the trellium-D storage box. She removes some rocks from a canister near
the bottom. In the lab, she turns the rock into liquid and injects
herself with it.)
 [Shuttle bay]
 TRAVIS: The escape pod can manoeuvre underwater.
Aside from that, nothing out of the ordinary.
HOSHI: I've gone through the databanks. Just your standard navigational
operational files, but I did find one document. An engineer asking his
supervisors for additional parts. Here's a translation.
ARCHER: The names of these supervisors. Piral, Jaina, Trenia.
HOSHI: The names of Degra's children.
 [Command centre]
 T'POL: I discovered a set of coordinates embedded
in the document.
ARCHER: It's not a star system.
T'POL: There was another embedded number. A stardate, three days from
now.
ARCHER: How far away are the coordinates?
T'POL: Four light years. We'll need at least warp three to make it in
time. It's unlikely that Degra will wait beyond three days.
 [Archer's quarters]
 PHLOX: (putting Porthos down) He's all yours. He
was the perfect house guest, as usual. You'll be happy to know that I
discharged Ensign Ansara this morning, and Corporal O'Malley will be
returning to duty this afternoon. Captain?
ARCHER: It's hard to imagine that we'll ever get this ship back to the
way it was.
PHLOX: It's a simple matter of repairs. Well, perhaps not that simple.
Somehow, I don't think it's the damage to Enterprise that's troubling
you.
ARCHER: How long have you been a doctor?
PHLOX: Nearly forty years.
ARCHER: And in all that time, did you ever do anything you thought was
unethical?
PHLOX: Twice. Why?
ARCHER: I'm about to step over a line, a line I thought I would never
cross. And given the nature of our mission, it probably won't be the
last.
PHLOX: Probably not. May I ask what you're planning to do?
ARCHER: There could be more casualties.
PHLOX: I'll be ready.
 [Armoury]
 ARCHER: Put together an armed boarding party.
REED: Who are we boarding, sir?
ARCHER: The alien ship we docked with.
REED: I don't understand.
ARCHER: We need their warp coil. They won't give it to us, so we're
going to have to take it.
REED: Captain.
ARCHER: Get your men together!
 [Xindi Council Chamber]
(A pale, bald humanoid female keeps
flickering in and out.)  BUILDER: Where are the other members of the Council?
HUMANOID: We didn't want them here.
BUILDER: Why?
ARBOREAL: We've learned something about the reptilians that concerns
us.
BUILDER: There's distrust amongst you.
ARBOREAL: You can help alleviate it.
BUILDER: Continue.
DEGRA: We were told the reptilians attempted to build a bioweapon.
BUILDER: Who told you this?
HUMANOID: We've also learned that they were building this bioweapon in
the past, on Earth.
DEGRA: As far as we're aware, reptilians don't possess the technology
for time travel.
BUILDER: You want to know if they had my help.
DEGRA: Did they?
BUILDER: Yes. After you prohibited them from constructing the
bioweapon, the reptilians and the insectoids were prepared to withdraw
from the Council. I assisted them so the Council would remain unified.
DEGRA: You helped them to circumvent our authority.
BUILDER: I protected your authority by keeping the Council intact.
DEGRA: What happened to the bioweapon?
BUILDER: It was never completed, and the three reptilians were never
found.
ARBOREAL: You can't locate them.
BUILDER: There are limits to what we can do in your realm.
DEGRA: It seems you can do more than we thought. Is it true your
species built the Spheres?
BUILDER: What makes you think you can subject me to this interrogation?
If it weren't for my assistance, your species would be facing
destruction.
ARBOREAL: We're grateful for the help that you've given us.
BUILDER: Then prove it. Focus on the task at hand. The weapon is nearly
complete. If you permit yourselves to become distracted, you'll fail to
destroy your real enemy. The enemy of all Xindi. Don't summon me again
unless every member of the Council is present. I won't help fuel your
internal bickering. (She vanishes.)
HUMANOID: You don't believe her.
DEGRA: Do you?
HUMANOID: Why should we take Archer's word over hers?
DEGRA: Because Archer offered something she hasn't. Proof.
 [Situation room]
 REED: Under normal circumstances they'd be no
match for us, but we've sustained a lot more damage than they have.
This could be risky.
TUCKER: One lucky shot to our starboard nacelle
ARCHER: Let's make sure they don't get any lucky shots.
TRAVIS: Why don't we just transport their warp coil to Enterprise?
TUCKER: It's tied into their injector system. If we use the
transporter, we'd destroy their engines. I've got to get in there,
decouple it by hand.
REED: How long?
TUCKER: Ten minutes, give or take. Can't tell for sure until I see it.
REED: If they fight back, ten minutes could be a very long time.
T'POL: Perhaps we should reconsider negotiation.
ARCHER: We can't risk tipping them off. We have to take them by
surprise. That'll reduce the losses on both sides. We'll disable their
ship as quickly as we can, beam over, extract the warp coil and get
out, hopefully without any casualties. Set a course.
T'POL: Can I have a word with you?
ARCHER: Not right now.
 [Ready room]
(Archer has to push open the door manually.)
ARCHER: If I had another option, I'd take it.
T'POL: We are no different than the marauders who attacked us when we
entered the Expanse.
ARCHER: We're a lot different.
T'POL: By stealing their warp coil we could be condemning them to
death.
ARCHER: We're going to leave them a supply of trellium, along with some
extra food. I'm not saying it'll be easy for them, but they'll stand a
decent chance of making it home.
T'POL: You're forgetting that we're in a dangerous region of space. Our
assault could cripple their ability to defend themselves.
ARCHER: Not if we do it right.
T'POL: And what if something goes wrong?
ARCHER: We can debate this all day. I've made my decision.
T'POL: We can't save humanity without holding on to what makes us
human. Those were your words to me.
ARCHER: I'm no happier doing this than you are, but we're not going to
make a habit of it.
T'POL: Once you rationalise the first mis-step, it's easy to fall into
a pattern of behaviour.
ARCHER: I'm not rationalising anything. I know full well what I'm
doing.
T'POL: I can't justify this course of action.
ARCHER: We don't have a choice.
T'POL: I won't let you do it! (She smashesher PADD against the edge of his
deck.)
ARCHER: We've had our share of disagreements, but you've never taken it
out on my desk before.
T'POL: I apologise.
ARCHER: What's happening to you?
T'POL: It's been a difficult few days. I haven't had the time to
meditate.
ARCHER: Maybe you should find the time.
T'POL: I didn't mean what I said.
ARCHER: I'm glad to hear it. I'll be leading the boarding party.
There's no margin for error. If we don't do this right, people are
going to die. We need you on the Bridge.
T'POL: Understood.
 [Sickbay]
 T'POL: Doctor.
PHLOX: Yes, this will just take a moment. (T'Pol grabs his arm.) PHLOX: What is
it? (After examining her.)
PHLOX: There's a good deal of residual trellium
in your bloodstream. How long have you been doing this?
T'POL: Three months.
PHLOX: I need to know precisely what has been happening.
T'POL: When I was exposed to trellium aboard the Seleya, it affected me
in a way that I wasn't prepared for.
PHLOX: As I recall, you were homicidal and paranoid.
T'POL: The initial effects were overwhelming, but as they began to wear
off I discovered I was able to access certain emotions. I wanted more.
I began to experiment by ingesting small amounts of trellium. I devised
a way to inject it into my bloodstream.
PHLOX: You must have known it was dangerous. Trellium exposure is
deadly to Vulcans. It eats away at the neural pathways.
T'POL: I thought, in small amounts, it would be safe. At first, I was
able to control the new emotions. My interactions with the crew
improved.
PHLOX: Commander Tucker, for example. When did you realise you were
becoming addicted?
T'POL: Two days ago. The damage to E deck made it impossible to access
the cargo bay. I began experiencing agitation, anxiety, withdrawal
symptoms.
PHLOX: You're not experiencing them now.
T'POL: I was able to retrieve the trellium. I was almost killed in the
process.
PHLOX: This will help stabilise your synaptic pathways, but the
withdrawal symptoms will return in a few days. It's going to take time.
It won't be easy.
T'POL: I understand.
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to T'Pol.
T'POL: Go ahead.
ARCHER [OC]: We're approaching the vessel. Report to the Bridge.
T'POL: I'm on my way.
PHLOX: You should remain here for observation.
T'POL: The Captain needs me. I have to go.
PHLOX: I expect you to report back here at the first sign of trouble.
T'POL: Are you going to discuss this with the Captain?
PHLOX: This is between you and your doctor.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Good luck.
ARCHER: You have the Bridge.
T'POL: Stand by weapons.
 [Illyrian Engineering]
 ILLYRIAN: Run another test. If it doesn't hold,
we'll have to bypass the entire assembly. (comm. beeps) What is it?
CREW [OC]: Sir, there's a vessel approaching. It's the Earth ship.
ILLYRIAN: Have you contacted them?
CREW [OC]: They're not responding.
 [Bridge]
 HOSHI: They're still hailing us.
TRAVIS: Two hundred kilometres.
T'POL: Target their propulsion systems.
REED: Aye.
T'POL: Fire.
REED: (after three phase cannon shots) Their warp drive's offline.
They're charging weapons.
T'POL: Bridge to transporter.
REED: They're firing.
T'POL: Energise.
 [Illyrian Engineering]
 (The boarding party appear and there's a gun fight
between the MACOs and the Illyrians whilst the two ships tussle it out
as well.)
TUCKER: That's the access port.
ARCHER: Stun grenade. (bang) Go! (Tucker and a MACO head up an access
tube.)
 [Bridge]
 REED: Their weapons are at fifty percent.
HOSHI: We have another hull breach, on E deck.
TRAVIS: Our port thrusters are offline.
REED: We have to take out their weapons!
T'POL: We can't leave them defenceless.
REED: If we want to get through this in one piece, we may have no
choice.
T'POL: The Captain's orders.
 [Illyrian warp assembly]
 MACO: Clear. (Tucker is knocked down by a
forcefield surrounding the warp coil.)
 [Illyrian Engineering]
 ARCHER: Cover. (communicator beeps) Archer.
TUCKER [OC]: Captain.
 [Illyrian warp assembly]
 TUCKER: We've hit a little snag.
 [Bridge]
 REED: They're targeting our starboard nacelle.
T'POL: Evasive manoeuvres. T'Pol to the Captain.
 [Illyrian Engineering]
 ARCHER: Go ahead.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: We're taking heavy damage.
ARCHER [OC]: There's a forcefield around the warp coil.
 [Illyrian Engineering]
 ARCHER: Trip's trying to disable it.
 [Illyrian warp assembly]
 TUCKER: Try it now.
(his MACO bodyguard still encounters the forcefield)
 [Illyrian Engineering]
 (meanwhile the fighting goes on)
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise.
T'POL [OC]: Go ahead.
ARCHER: Parson's been hit. Lock onto her comm. signal and
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: beam her out of here.
T'POL: Lieutenant.
REED: We're venting atmosphere on C deck. T'Pol!
T'POL: Adjust phase cannons to a narrow confinement beam. Target this
power juncture.
REED: Got it.
T'POL: Fire!
 [Illyrian warp assembly]
 (The ship is plunged into darkness, and the
forcefield goes out.)
TUCKER: Right there. (By the light of the torch on the MACO's rifle
Tucker disconnects the warp coil, and they beam back to Enterprise with
it.)
 [Illyrian Engineering]
 ARCHER: (answering communicator) Archer.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Commander Tucker's aboard. We have it.
 [Illyrian Engineering]
 ARCHER: Stand by to beam us out. Fall back.
(they retreat straight to a man with a gun)
ILLYRIAN: What you can't have, you take by force?
ARCHER: We've beamed three containers of trellium into your cargo hold
as compensation. There's also food and supplies.
ILLYRIAN: You're stranding us three years from home. Why are you doing
this?
ARCHER: Because I have no choice. Energise.
(Enterprise flies off, leaving the Illyrians drifting in space.)
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 T'POL: I'm not sure why I asked you to come see
me.
PHLOX: Perhaps you just needed some company.
T'POL: Perhaps.
PHLOX: How do you feel?
T'POL: I thought that without the trellium I would no longer have
difficulty suppressing my emotions, but that's not true.
PHLOX: It's not surprising that there are residual effects. They're
probably temporary.
T'POL: And if they're not?
PHLOX: Then you'll learn to cope with them.
T'POL: I'm not certain I'll be able to. I'm
PHLOX: Afraid?
T'POL: Vulcans don't experience fear.
PHLOX: You sought these emotions. Don't expect them to vanish
overnight. Patience.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: A few tweaks and it fit right in.
ARCHER: What's our top speed.
TUCKER: Three point two. That should get us to the rendezvous point
with time to spare.
(Archer descends from the warp controls with a wince, and a massive
guilt cloud hanging over him.)
TUCKER: You did the right thing.
ARCHER: It seems the longer we're out here, the more I have to keep
saying that to myself.
TUCKER: Those people'll be okay. They'll get home.
ARCHER: Captain to the Bridge.
REED [OC]: Go ahead.
ARCHER: Prepare to go to maximum warp.
REED [OC]: Aye sir.

The Enterprise Transcripts - The Forgotten
The Forgotten
    Original Airdate: Apr 28, 2004
ARCHER: Previously on Enterprise
          REED [Corridor]: We don't have a complete casualty list yet, but so far the news isn't good. Five people are confirmed dead,
          dozens wounded.
          ARCHER [Reptilian brig]: If you destroy Earth you won't just be eliminating my species, you'll be eliminating your own.
          T'POL [Sickbay]: Do you have any idea why they released you?
          ARCHER: I think I may have gotten through to one of them. Degra.
          DEGRA [Xindi Council Chamber]: We were told the Reptilians attempted to build a bioweapon.
          BUILDER: Who told you this?
          HUMANOID: We've also learned that they were building this bioweapon in the past, on Earth.
          T'POL [Sickbay]: When I was exposed to trellium, it affected me in a way I wasn't prepared for. I discovered
          I was able to access certain emotions. I wanted more. I devised a way to inject it into my bloodstream.
          PHLOX: You must have known it was dangerous. Trellium exposure is deadly to Vulcans.
          TUCKER: (having his nightmare) Elizabeth, get out of there!
 [Cargo bay]
          ARCHER: We're in bad shape, I can't deny that, but we're still in one piece. Enterprise is a tough
          ship. She took more than anyone could ask her to and then some, and so have all of you. I wanted to say
          thank you. I only wish I could thank the eighteen crewmen who were lost. Like you, they understood how
          important our mission is and they accepted the risks. We came into the Expanse not knowing what we'd find,
          with no one to rely on but ourselves, but we're going to succeed, to accomplish our mission, for everyone
          on Earth who's relying on us, and for the eighteen.
         
 [Ready room]
          TUCKER: We managed to get into sections six and seven on C deck. We found Taylor and Kamata.
          T'POL: That accounts for everyone.
          ARCHER: What's our status on weapons?
          T'POL: Mister Reed has both forward phase cannons back online in addition to the aft torpedo launchers.
          Hull plating is up to eighty percent.
          ARCHER: That'll have to do.
          TUCKER: We could wait, hang back until we've had a chance to make more repairs.
          T'POL: Degra's message was clear. We're to meet him ten hours from now.
          ARCHER: And I don't intend to be late.
          TUCKER: Maybe that's what he's counting on. Lure us into an ambush while we're still licking
          our wounds.
          ARCHER: I've made my decision. We have a lot of work to do. I suggest we get to it.
          TUCKER: Aye sir. (T'Pol leaves.)
          ARCHER: Commander. Crewman Taylor was one of yours, wasn't she?
          TUCKER: She was an EPS control specialist, a damn good one.
          ARCHER: I'd like you to write a letter to her family.
          TUCKER: She worked on Rostov's team. I can ask him.
          ARCHER: I asked you.
          TUCKER: I'm barely holding the ship together. I don't have time to sit down to and write a letter.
          ARCHER: It doesn't have to be long. Her family deserves to know what happened to her.
          TUCKER: Understood.
         
 [Sickbay]
          T'POL: You're busy. I'll come back.
          PHLOX: Have a seat. I'll have to use a hand scanner. The imaging chamber is still offline.
          Commander Tucker reassigned the repair team that was working here. He said the Armoury was
          a higher priority. We'll see how low a priority I am the next time he burns his fingers on a
          plasma conduit. (examines her) You've experienced no further withdrawal symptoms?
          T'POL: None.
          PHLOX: I'm only detecting trace amounts of trellium in your system. Hardly worth mentioning.
          That's good news. What is it?
          T'POL: (agitated) These emotions have grown more difficult to control. My usual techniques for suppressing them
          haven't been effective.
          PHLOX: On Earth, there is a cautionary tale about the dangers of releasing a magical creature called a
          genie from the bottle. Once it's out, it's extremely difficult to put back in.
          T'POL: Are you saying these emotions may never subside?
          PHLOX: You used trellium for three months. It caused significant damage to your neural pathways. You
          may have to learn to live with these emotions.
         
 [Bridge]
          (There's welding going on in the Situation room, and Hoshi's hair is a mess.)
          TRAVIS: We're approaching the coordinates, Captain. Right on schedule.
          REED: No ships out there, sir.
          ARCHER: Hoshi.
          HOSHI: Scanning all frequencies. Nothing so far.
          TRAVIS: Maybe they're running late? (The ship shudders.)
          ARCHER: Tactical alert!
          T'POL: It's a spatial anomaly. We've entered a dense field.
         
 [Engineering]
(Things start to crackle and flex.)           TUCKER: Tucker to the Bridge.
         
 [Bridge]
          TUCKER [OC]: This is not the best time for this.
          ARCHER: Stand by, Trip.
          REED: Reports of injuries on B deck. (Lots more stuff goes bang and flash.) REED: No one's out there, sir.
          ARCHER: Get us out of here.
          TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
          T'POL: Captain.
          (On the viewscreen, a little ship appears from nowhere.)
          HOSHI: We're receiving a transmission. It's Degra. He's telling us to follow him.
          (Archer nods and they follow the little ship back into nothing.)
          ARCHER: Stay with him, Travis.
          TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
          (They emerge at a Sphere.)
          HOSHI: They're hailing us.
          DEGRA [on viewscreen]: I see you found my message. We have a great deal to discuss
          and I don't have much time. Come aboard my ship.
         
 [Degra's ship]
          DEGRA: If we'd left you with the Reptilians they would have killed you.
          ARBOREAL: Degra arranged for the Aquatics to return you to your ship.
          ARCHER: Then you also called off the attack on Enterprise?
          DEGRA: The Reptilians weren't very pleased about that either.
          ARCHER: You've taken a big risk.
          DEGRA: If you're telling the truth, the future of my people is at stake.
          ARCHER: Everything I've told you is true.
          ARBOREAL: Forgive me, but the Council will need more than your word. Perhaps
          you can demonstrate your ability to time travel?
          ARCHER: That might be a bit difficult, but if you come aboard my ship I can give you
          all the proof you want.
          ARBOREAL: Very well.
          ARCHER: But there are some things I want to know first.
          ARBOREAL: Such as?
          ARCHER: When will your weapon be launched?
          DEGRA: The precise date hasn't been determined yet.
          ARCHER: Weeks? Days?
          ARBOREAL: That's up to the Council.
          ARCHER: I'm trying to help you, but I need to know my world isn't being destroyed
          while I'm doing it.
          DEGRA: The weapon won't be launched for several days. Show us your proof and we'll
          do what we can to stop it.
         
 [Mess hall]
          (Ration packs are being handed out.)
          TUCKER: What'd you get?
          T'POL: Pepperoni pizza.
          TUCKER: Don't worry, you can pick the pepperoni off. (T'Pol seeing the PADD he's holding.)
          T'POL: Damage reports?
          TUCKER: No, the Captain wants me to write a letter to Crewman Taylor's family.
          T'POL: I'm sure they'll appreciate that.
          TUCKER: Their daughter's dead. Do you really think they'll care what I have to say?
          T'POL: When was the last time you slept?
          TUCKER: I don't know. Not since the attack.
          T'POL: That was two days ago.
          TUCKER: All right then, two days.
          T'POL: Go to your quarters. Get some sleep.
          TUCKER: Believe me, I'd love to.
          T'POL: I could order you.
          TUCKER: I don't have time. We're full of holes. The only thing keeping us
          flying is a stolen warp coil, and now I've got to write this letter. (jolt) What the hell?
         
 [Corridor]
          (A crewman has been badly burnt. T'Pol and Trip pull him away as another crewman puts out the fire.)
          TUCKER: Tucker to Engineering. Shut down the auxiliary coolant line between sections twelve
          and fourteen on E deck.
          CREWMAN [OC]: Aye sir.
          TUCKER: Tucker to Sickbay. Medical emergency on E deck, section twelve.
          PHLOX [OC]: On my way, Commander.
          TUCKER: Reactor pressure's holding. Good thing I wasn't taking a nap.
          (But on the outside of the hull, we see atmosphere escaping.)
         
 [Morgue]
(Degra views the Reptilian bodies.)           DEGRA: Damron.
          ARCHER: A friend of yours?
          DEGRA: A colleague, of sorts.
          ARCHER: They're the ones we found on Earth, in the past.
          ARBOREAL: And this is the result of your finding them?
          ARCHER: They were about to release a bioweapon that would have decimated the population.
          DEGRA: Reptilians felt a toxin would be more effective on your species. Damron and his
          team disappeared shortly after the Council rejected his proposal.
          ARCHER: Apparently he decided to go ahead without your Council's approval.
          ARBOREAL: But fortunately, you were able to stop him, by travelling back through time.
          ARCHER: I already told you. We had help, just like they did.
          ARBOREAL: This proves nothing. How do we know he didn't capture them in the present.
          ARCHER: You need more evidence.
         
 [Secure storage]
          (Archer opens up the Xindi bioweapon contraption and takes out the central cylinder.)
          ARCHER: They had this with them. We destroyed the toxin, but my doctor kept a sample
          of it in stasis.
          DEGRA: This appears to be Xindi technology, but I'd like to have our engineers confirm it.
          ARCHER: Have them come aboard, perform whatever test they'd like.
          ARBOREAL: This proves nothing except the reptilians disobeyed the Council, which comes
          as no great surprise. But you also claim that we've been misled by transdimensional aliens.
          Where is your evidence of that? (Archer puts the cylinder back in the device and locking it all away again.)
          ARCHER: Come with me.
         
 [Corridor]
          TUCKER: There's a microfracture in the magnesium jacket. That's why it ruptured.
          CREWMAN: I ran a pressure test.
          TUCKER: Tell it to the man lying in Sickbay! Test them again, all of them.
          CREWMAN: Aye, sir.
          PHLOX: Commander.
          TUCKER: I'm a little busy, Doc.
          PHLOX: So it seems. I understand you haven't slept since the attack.
          TUCKER: T'Pol tattling on me now?
          PHLOX: Perhaps she's worried about you.
          TUCKER: Well, I appreciate that, but I'm trying to hold this ship together with spit and
          baling wire.
          PHLOX: Has it occurred to you that we'll be far worse off if you collapse from exhaustion?
          TUCKER: Your concern is duly noted, Doc, but I've got to get back to work.
          PHLOX: I don't believe so.
          TUCKER: Come again?
          PHLOX: I'm relieving you of duty. You will go to your quarters and not return to your post before oh five
          hundred tomorrow.
          TUCKER: Six hours?
          PHLOX: Please don't make me involve security.
          ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Doctor Phlox.
          PHLOX: Yes, Captain.
          ARCHER [OC]: I need you in Sickbay.
          PHLOX: I'll be right there. Well, Commander?
          TUCKER: I can give you two hours.
          PHLOX: I believe the number was six.
          TUCKER: If I'm gone longer than three there may not be a ship here when I get back.
          PHLOX: Four. Not a minute less.
          TUCKER: Done. And remind me never to buy a car from you. Captain's waiting for you.
          PHLOX: I'm aware of that.
          TUCKER: Well, goodnight then.
          (Meanwhile, the air leak gets bigger.)
         
 [Sickbay]
          (Images of the transdimensional harbinger alien on a screen.)
          ARCHER: We found him adrift. Do you recognise his species?
          ARBOREAL: We've met one of them.
          DEGRA: What caused his death?
          ARCHER: Some kind of cellular degeneration. It started the moment he was taken off his ship.
          DEGRA: Perhaps your atmosphere was toxic to him.
          PHLOX: I believe our universe was toxic to him. His species evolved in a different dimension with
          a different set of physical laws. He simply couldn't exist here.
          ARCHER: That's why his species built the Spheres, to make our space more compatible for themselves.
          PHLOX: I believe he was a test subject sent here to see if they were succeeding.
          DEGRA: And if they are, you're saying the Expanse will no longer be compatible for us.
          PHLOX: Or any of us.
          ARCHER: We're destined to form an alliance to stop them, but if you destroy Earth that'll
          never happen. You'll be condemning your own race to extinction.
         
 [Taylor's quarters]
          (Tucker has woken in his own quarters and gone to Taylor's wrecked quarters, looking for inspiration. He finds
          a broken picture in a frame.)
          TAYLOR: Trouble sleeping, sir?
          TUCKER: Taylor! You were killed. This whole section decompressed. Did you find a sealed compartment?
          TAYLOR: No.
          TUCKER: Then how? (realises) You're dead, and I'm dreaming.
          TAYLOR: The letter. How's it going?
          TUCKER: I got as far as 'I regret to inform you.'
          TAYLOR: That's a little dry, sir.
          TUCKER: You're not real. You don't have to call me sir.
          TAYLOR: So what's the problem? The letter doesn't have to be long, the Captain told you that.
          You can't think of anything.
          TUCKER: I wish it was that simple.
          TAYLOR: I served on Enterprise for three years. You pulled me off the Saratoga to be on your
          team. Captain Brody was pretty angry at you.
          TUCKER: I'd forgot about that.
          TAYLOR: You told me I'd make a fine Chief Engineer someday.
          TUCKER: You will. You would have.
          TAYLOR: Then tell my parents that. Tell them about the practical jokes Rostov used to play, or that
          one time when I found that glitch in the injector assembly that everyone else missed?
          Tell them how hard I worked. Tell them how much you liked me. Why can't you look at me? Just
          remember me. Is that asking so much?
          TUCKER: Yes.
          TAYLOR: Why? (He tries to leave but she stops him.)TAYLOR:  Why?
          (Tucker wakes up again in his own quarters.)
         
 [Degra's ship]
          ARBOREAL: These tests only confirm the equipment belonged to the reptilians.
          DEGRA: There's also evidence of chronometric distortion. Time travel.
          ARBOREAL: The readings could have been fabricated.
          DEGRA: You're determined not to trust him.
          ARBOREAL: No more than you seem to be determined to believe whatever he says. Now, I admit
          Archer's evidence is intriguing, but we barely know this human. Our contact from the future
          has helped us many times. She brought this Council together.
          DEGRA: And you've never wondered if she might have an agenda of her own?
          ARBOREAL: I am not a fool, Degra. All I'm saying is that it'll take a little more than a
          few chronometric distortions to turn the Council against her.
          DEGRA: Captain Archer is expecting me.
          ARBOREAL: More evidence?
          DEGRA: He claims to know a great deal about the Spheres.
          ARBOREAL: Degra, I know you've had doubts about building the weapon. Don't let them cloud
          your judgment.
         
 [Command centre]
          (Degra is standing with T'Pol as Tucker works lying on the floor by the wall.
          The main display screen is a maze of fuzz and distortion)
          T'POL: We've been working to reconstruct our database.
          TUCKER: The pounding your ships gave us didn't help much. Try it now. I'm going to
          reset the optical subprocessors. That might clear it up. When we slipped through your detection
          grid, we got a look at the weapon you're building. An impressive piece of engineering. Hell, it'd take
          at least a thousand starships like Enterprise to blow up an entire planet. You know, I'd like to
          see the telemetry from the probe you launched against Earth.
          T'POL: Increase the data resolution.
          TUCKER: I assume you were watching the attack, calculating the blast yields. Boy, you must
          have been pretty damn excited. I mean, that beam cut one hell of a swath through Florida.
          That's the name of one of the places you destroyed. Florida.
          T'POL: Commander.
          TUCKER: Did you actually see the cities burning? The houses, the people being
          vaporised? I had a sister there.
          T'POL: Commander!
          ARCHER: How are the repairs coming.
          TUCKER: Just need a few more minutes, Captain.
          ARCHER: (to Degra) Why don't you join me in my Ready room until they're finished. (Degra leaves. To Tucker -)
          ARCHER: Let's stick to the job at hand.
          TUCKER: Aye, sir. (Archer leaves.)
          T'POL: The Captain is trying to gain Degra's trust.
          (Tucker closes his tool box and stalks out of the room. Outside, the hole blows into a green volcano.)
         
 [Situation room]
          (The wall monitor has 'System failure' in large red letters on it.)
          TUCKER: It's one of the warp plasma conduits.
          T'POL: It must have ruptured when our sensors were offline.
          DEGRA: Perhaps my crew can help.
          TUCKER: We'll handle it.
          ARCHER: We'll need to shut down the main plasma feeds.
          TUCKER: The flow regulators are damaged. There are manual cut-offs here and here, but
          we can only access it from outside.
          REED: That's very close to the fire.
          TUCKER: We don't have a choice. (ship judders) If we don't get control of it fast, it'll spread to the reactor.
          ARCHER: Get going.
          TUCKER: I could use a hand.
          REED: That'd be me, sir.
         
 [Ship's hull]
          (Two figures walk across the girders over a hole in the hull to approach the green Vesuvius.)
          TUCKER: Open that panel and I'll talk you through the cut-off sequence.
          REED: Where's the other valve?
          TUCKER: Over there.
          (Reed has trouble with his panel, but Tucker's opens smoothly.)
          TUCKER: I need to open the emergency bypass ports first, and you can't close
          your valve until I release the pressure from the secondary lines.
         
 [Bridge]
          REED [OC]: Commander, I have a problem.
         
 [Ship's hull]
          REED: I think the heat's warped the metal. The panel won't open.
          TUCKER: Use your plasma torch. I'll be there in a minute. I'm releasing the interlocks
          on the first port.
          REED: This is going to take a while.
         
 [Bridge]
          TUCKER [OC]: Careful you don't cut through the bypass relays, Malcolm.
          T'POL: The manifold pressure is increasing. We have less than six minutes before the
          fire reaches the reactor shielding.
          ARCHER: Archer to Trip.
         
 [Ship's hull]
          ARCHER [OC]: You've got less than six minutes.
          TUCKER: Understood. (The plasma stream flares.) TUCKER: You okay, Malcolm?
          REED: Almost there.
         
 [Bridge]
          HOSHI: Captain, the temperature in Lieutenant Reed's suit is over forty four degrees.
          T'POL: He's too close to the fire. His EV suit can't compensate.
          ARCHER: Malcolm
         
 [Ship's hull]
          ARCHER [OC]: Get back to the airlock.
          REED: I'm almost finished, Captain.
          ARCHER [OC]: That's an order.
          TUCKER: Get inside, Malcolm. I can wrap it up. (Reed finishes cutting around the panel)
          I'm opening the primary bypass port. Two more to go and we're in business. (Reed gets his panel open
          and sends it floating off into space.)
         
 [Bridge]
          HOSHI: Forty six degrees.
          ARCHER: Malcolm.
         
 [Ship's hull]
          REED: I'm sorry sir, you're breaking up.
          (So's his eyesight.)
          TUCKER: Get inside, Malcolm. I can finish.
          REED: There's no time. Do what you have to do so I can shut this down.
          TUCKER: A few more seconds. I'm purging the last port.
         
 [Bridge]
          T'POL: The forward valve is closed.
         
 [Ship's hull]
          TUCKER: Okay, Malcolm, clockwise ninety degrees. (The jet shuts down and Tucker walks over.) TUCKER: Nice work, Malcolm. Malcolm?
          (He's passed out.) TUCKER: Malcolm! Tucker to Doctor Phlox.
         
 [Bridge]
          TUCKER [OC]: Meet us in the airlock.
         
 [EV suit storage]
          PHLOX: We need to bring his body temperature down. Let's get him to Sickbay. (Phlox leaves.)
          DEGRA: I hope he'll be alright.
          TUCKER: What's one more dead human to you?
          ARCHER: Trip.
          TUCKER: He had no problem killing seven million of us, but seven million and one is more
          than you can stomach?
          ARCHER: That's enough.
          TUCKER: I guess even Xindi have their limits.
          ARCHER: I said that's enough!
          TUCKER: Aye, sir.
         
 [Command centre]
          ARCHER: We've determined there are fifty nine of them.
          DEGRA: Seventy eight, at our last count.
          ARCHER: Seventy eight?
          DEGRA: We've had more time to study them than you.
          ARCHER: I apologise for Mister Tucker.
          DEGRA: I never expected to meet anyone who'd suffered because of what I'd done. At the time,
          I thought the attack was necessary to save my people.
          ARCHER: I know. Believe it or not, we've had this conversation before.
          DEGRA: That's right. Our escape from prison together. The reptilians are correct about
          one thing, Captain. You have an impressive facility for deception.
          ARCHER: Erasing your memory probably wasn't the best way to earn your trust.
          DEGRA: Probably not. (referring to Sphere diagram) They are all connected by a
          subspace energy grid. Unfortunately our data on the Spheres' interiors is extremely
          limited.
          ARCHER: Maybe I can help. (He calls up pictures of the inside of a Sphere.)
          DEGRA: How did you get this?
          ARCHER: The first Sphere we came across was damaged. There was a breach in the outer shell.
          DEGRA: We've never been able to gain access to one. These scans are remarkably detailed for a
          military vessel.
          ARCHER: Enterprise was designed to be a ship of exploration.
          DEGRA: If we're successful, it will be again.
         
 [Tucker's quarters]
          TUCKER: Computer, begin recording. Dear Mister and Mrs. Taylor, I regret to inform you that
          your daughter was killed in the line of duty. She was a fine engineer, and she died performing
          her duties. Computer, stop recording. Delete that. Computer, start again. Dear Mister and Mrs. Taylor. As
          Jane's commanding officer, it's with deepest regret that I inform you of her death. She was a
          diligent engineer, very hard-working.
          REED [OC]: Tactical alert. All hands to stations.
         
 [Bridge]
          ARCHER: Report.
          T'POL: We've detected a ship. They've just passed through the cloaking barrier.
          ARCHER: On screen.
          REED: Reptilians.
          ARCHER: Did you invite anyone else?
          DEGRA: We masked our warp trail. I don't know how they found us.
         
 [Degra's ship]
          REPTILIAN [on viewscreen]: Where is Degra?
          ARBOREAL: He's involved in sensitive negotiations.
          REPTILIAN [on viewscreen]: With the humans? I supposed the Council authorised these
          negotiations?
          ARBOREAL: No one authorised the development of a bioweapon, but that didn't deter your
          colleagues from creating one.
          REPTILIAN [on viewscreen]: Undock from the human vessel immediately.
         
 [Bridge]
          ARBOREAL [on viewscreen]: He intends to seize the human vessel. He'll destroy both our
          ships if we don't comply.
          DEGRA: Stand by.
          ARBOREAL [on viewscreen]: Degra.
          DEGRA: I said, stand by.
          REED: We don't stand a chance against them. Not in the shape we're in.
          ARCHER: What kind of weapons do you have?
          DEGRA: You expect me to attack a reptilian warship?
          ARCHER: If we work together, we might be able to disable them.
          REED: They're charging weapons.
          ARCHER: Are you familiar with the design of that ship?
          DEGRA: I did some work on their power systems.
          REED: Then you know where they're vulnerable, where to target our weapons.
          DEGRA: Their ship is heavily armoured.
          ARCHER: At least we'd stand a chance.
          DEGRA: Those reptilians are Xindi. You're asking me to attack my own people.
         
 [Degra's ship]
          (After undocking from Enterprise.)
          REPTILIAN [on viewscreen]: Proceed to our starboard docking port.
          DEGRA: I want your word that my crew won't be punished.
          REPTILIAN [on viewscreen]: You'll all be dealt with as the Council sees fit.
         
 [Bridge]
          TRAVIS: He's nearly reached the Reptilians.
          (As Degra's ship flies past, he fires twice.)
          REED: He's knocked out their shield generators.
          ARCHER: Fire. (They exchange torpedoes and phase cannon fire.) ARCHER: Evasive manoeuvres. Keep
          firing. Target their weapons.
          (More shooting.)
          REED: Their weapons are down. Degra was spot on. He knew exactly where to hit them.
          ARCHER: Open a channel to Degra.
          REED: Sir, he's charging weapons!
          (Two more shots from Degra and the big warship falls apart.)
          T'POL: The Reptilian ship has been destroyed.
          HOSHI: Captain, Degra's hailing us.
          DEGRA [on viewscreen]: They would have contacted the Council and exposed our alliance.
          I had no choice.
         
 [a wrecked area]
          T'POL: Crewman Rostov said I'd find you here.
          TUCKER: Repair crews are starting tomorrow. Thought I'd try and get them some power.
          These assemblies are all fused together. I've spent the last hour trying to isolate
          the damaged relays.
          T'POL: You might find this useful. Portable power cells.
          TUCKER: Courtesy of our new Xindi friends? Damn neighbourly of them.
          T'POL: Is there anything I can help you with?
          TUCKER: Not unless you can resurrect the dead. Crewman Taylor had a real knack for this
          kind of thing. But Taylor's not here, is she, and neither is Crewman Kamata, or Ensign Marcel
          or a dozen others. So forgive me if I don't want the damn power cells! (kicks the container
          across the corridor) We found Taylor over there,
          outside her quarters. She was probably trying to get to her station. If she'd made it a few more metres
          I wouldn't be trying to write this damn letter. 'Cause every time I start I hear myself saying, what a fine
          young woman she was, how smart and full of potential. And I realise that I'm not thinking
          about Taylor at all. I'm thinking about Elizabeth. There's so many people dead. I tried not
          to see her any differently than the other seven million, so I've spent the last nine months
          trying to pretend she was just another victim. But she's my sister, T'Pol. My baby sister. (finally he cries)
          I envy you Vulcans.
          T'POL: You think that the loss of a colleague or friend doesn't affect us? It does. But if we give in
          to those emotions, they overwhelm us. You're the ones to be envied.
         
 [Ready room]
          DEGRA: You need to speak to the Council. With the evidence you've shown me, they'll have no
          choice but to take us seriously.
          ARCHER: Even the reptilians?
          DEGRA: I'm more concerned about the aquatics. They can be somewhat enigmatic, but if we can
          sway them we'll have the majority on our side. (hands over a PADD) These are the coordinates of the Council chamber.
          ARCHER: This is nearly a dozen light years away. It'll take us weeks to get there.
          DEGRA: There's a shorter route, a subspace corridor. It's located in a nebula less than half
          a light year from here. That will show your helmsman how to get through it. I'll meet you at the
          far end in three days.
          ARCHER: Will it be soon enough to stop the weapon?
          DEGRA: I'll do everything I can to delay it. Use caution when you enter the nebula. A hostile
          species is known to prey on ships that approach it.
          ARCHER: Thanks for the warning. (Archer holds out his hand, and they shake.) ARCHER: See you in three days.
          DEGRA: Three days.
         
 [Tucker's quarters]
          TUCKER: Computer, begin recording. Mister and Mrs. Taylor, by the time you get this, Starfleet
          will have already told you about Jane. Since I worked so closely with her, I wanted to add
          my personal condolences. I have to confess, I've been putting off writing this for a while. I
          convinced myself that my duties on Enterprise took precedence. But the truth is I didn't want
          to face the fact that someone so young, with so much promise, could just be gone. But I'm
          facing it now, and I find myself thinking how important she was to me. She was a great engineer,
          and she was my friend. She won't be forgotten. (He puts down the picture he's holding.) TUCKER: Goodbye, Elizabeth.

The Enterprise Transcripts - E2
E2
 Original Airdate: 5 May, 2004
  ARCHER
[OC]: Previously on Enterprise
(Scenes of fighting fires and injured crew.)
ARCHER [OC]: We're in bad shape, I can't deny that.
DEGRA: Perhaps my crew can help.
(Over shots of T'Pol's dreams and anger outbursts.)
T'POL [OC]: My emotions are growing more difficult to control.
PHLOX [OC]: You used trellium for three months.
PHLOX [Sickbay]: You
may have to learn to live with these emotions.
DEGRA [Ready room]:
These are the coordinates of the Council chamber.
ARCHER: It'll take us weeks to get there.
DEGRA: There's a shorter route. A subspace corridor. I'll meet you at
the far end in three days.
ARCHER: See you in three days.
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 (It's dark. A candle is burning.)
T'POL: (a very old woman) Come in. The probe?
LORIAN: We couldn't stop it from entering the vortex. It's on it's way
to Earth.
T'POL: Seven million people.
LORIAN: Everything is happening as it did before.
T'POL: Then you have no choice. You must find Jonathan Archer.
 [T'Pol's quarters]
 (Our young woman is trying to meditate by
candlelight when the doorbell chimes.)
T'POL: Come in.
TUCKER: I'm sorry about to bother you. I'm having a little trouble
falling asleep. I think my insomnia 's come back.
T'POL: You're here for neuro-pressure.
TUCKER: It's been weeks since our last session. We've all been under a
lot of stress lately. I thought it might do us both some good.
T'POL: I think we should discontinue these treatments.
TUCKER: Why?
T'POL: You've become quite skilled with the postures I've shown you.
TUCKER: You told me it takes years to master neuro-pressure. I'm not
that quick a study.
T'POL: I've taught you all I can.
(Tucker sits down in front of her.)
TUCKER: Look, truth is I'm sleeping fine. I ain't come for
neuro-pressure, I came because I'm worried about you.
T'POL: Worried?
TUCKER: You've been keeping to yourself a lot lately, even more than
usual. You spend every free moment in your quarters, you even asked
Chef to bring your meals here.
T'POL: The Mess hall's heavily damaged. Where do you suggest I eat?
TUCKER: Come on, you've got to admit you've been avoiding me ever since
the two of us, you know, when we
T'POL: Had sexual relations.
TUCKER: That's real romantic when you put it that way.
T'POL: I told you, what happened was an exploration, not the prelude to
an intimate relationship.
TUCKER: I never said I wanted a relationship.
T'POL: Neither did I.
TUCKER: You helped me get through a rough patch, and I'm grateful. I
just stopped by to see if I could return the favour.
T'POL: I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine.
 [Command centre]
 REED: Degra said these Kovaalans have only one or
two ships inside the nebula.
T'POL: It would appear that his information is out of date. There are
at least half a dozen ships.
ARCHER: According to Degra, they're not very tolerant of trespassers.
How close are they to the corridor?
T'POL: Within sixty thousand kilometres.
ARCHER: We'll ionise the hull. That should mask our approach for a
while.
REED: I suggest we enter here, above this layer of metreon gas. It
should reflect our engine signature, create multiple sensor ghosts,
false readings. If we're lucky they won't know which one to fire at.
 [Degra's ship]
 (He's docked with another Xindi ship,)
HUMANOID: You gave them the coordinates? They could launch an attack
against the Council!
DEGRA: Archer's ship was heavily damaged. They wouldn't stand a chance
against one of our cruisers.
ARBOREAL: There may be other human ships in the Expanse.
DEGRA: Those readings were never confirmed.
HUMANOID: This discussion is pointless. You won't be allowed to bring
Archer before the Council.
DEGRA: Then we won't ask their permission.
HUMANOID: He'll be killed the moment he steps into the Council chamber.
DEGRA: They have to listen. His allegations are too important to simply
dismiss.
HUMANOID: Do you believe Archer's being truthful?
ARBOREAL: I don't think he's told us everything, but I can't explain
the evidence that we saw.
HUMANOID: The humans could have manufactured this evidence. They'd do
anything to save their planet.
DEGRA: If Archer is telling the truth, then all the Council's efforts
will have been for nothing.
HUMANOID: Reptilians patrol this side of the corridor. They'll destroy
the human vessel as soon as it comes through.
DEGRA: I've already considered that. We can protect them.
HUMANOID: What makes you think the Reptilians won't fire on us?
 [Bridge]
 (The nebula is on the viewscreen.)
ARCHER: Tactical alert. Take us in.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
T'POL: A ship is dropping out of warp.
ARCHER: Can you identify it?
T'POL: This can't be right.
ARCHER: T'Pol?
T'POL: It's Starfleet, NX class.
REED: Are you sure it's not a sensor reflection?
T'POL: We haven't entered the nebula yet.
TRAVIS: Whoever they are, they're on an intercept course.
HOSHI: We're within visual range.
(A rear view shows an identical ship approaching them.)
REED: Must be the NX02, Colombia.
ARCHER: It's still under construction.
HOSHI: I don't think that's Colombia.
(A magnified image shows the markings NX01 Enterprise.)
HOSHI: We're being hailed.
LORIAN [on viewscreen]: Captain Archer, you must reverse course
immediately.
ARCHER: Who are you?
LORIAN [on viewscreen]: There's no time to explain. Alter your heading.
ARCHER: Come about, Ensign. Would you tell me what the hell is going
on?
 [Docking port]
 (A MACO has his rifle aimed at the door when it
opens.)
LORIAN: Your weapons won't be necessary.
ARCHER: I'd like some answers first.
LORIAN: I'm Lorian, Commander of Enterprise. Karyn Archer, my first
officer.
(A woman with a protrusion all down her forehead to her nose.)
LORIAN: We should find a place to talk. Perhaps the Conference room?
You'll want T'Pol to join us.
 [Conference room]
 (As the two ships hang in space like Siamese
twins.)
LORIAN: You can't take your ship into the subspace corridor. If you do,
you'll be thrown back in time a hundred and seventeen years.
ARCHER: How would you know that?
LORIAN: Because it's already happened. We're here to make certain that
history doesn't repeat itself.
 [Bridge - Lorian's narrative]
 LORIAN [OC]: The Kovaalans attacked Enterprise as
soon as it entered the nebula.
REED: Phase cannons are offline.
ARCHER: Torpedoes, full spread. How long until we reach the corridor?
T'POL: Eighteen seconds.
REED: All plating's gone.
TRAVIS: We're losing speed.
ARCHER: Hold your course.
(As Enterprise dived into the corridor, the three attackers veered
off.)
LORIAN [OC]: The trip through the corridor took only a few seconds, but
it didn't take long before your crew realised something was wrong.
REED: No sign of pursuit.
ARCHER: Where are we?
T'POL: We've travelled eleven point six light years.
ARCHER: Degra?
T'POL: Nothing on long range sensors.
TRAVIS: Captain, the stars. They're not where they're supposed to be.
ARCHER: Are you sure we're at the right co-ordinates?
T'POL: Yes.
LORIAN [OC]: Enterprise was in the right place
 [Conference room]
 LORIAN: But it was
over a hundred years early. We're not entirely sure why this happened,
but we have a theory. We think your impulse wake destabilised the
corridor, causing it to shift in time.
ARCHER: Why didn't you, didn't we, go back through it?
KARYN: T'Pol eventually determined that ships can only travel through
this corridor in one direction.
 [Ready room - Lorian's narrative]
 ARCHER: I'll notify the crew. Let Travis know
we'll be getting underway.
T'POL: What course should we set?
ARCHER: Even if we found a way out of the Expanse, we can't go back to
Earth. We'd be contaminating our own culture, our own history.
T'POL: Cochran's warp flight won't happen for another twenty six years.
ARCHER: Maybe there's a way we can use this to our advantage.
T'POL: How?
ARCHER: We know the date when Earth is attacked by the first Xindi
probe. We may be able to figure out a way to warn them, or even prevent
the attack.
T'POL: The probe won't be deployed for more than a hundred years.
LORIAN [OC]: Your crew realised it would be their descendants
 [Conference room]
 LORIAN: Who'd have to complete this mission. It
was only a matter of time before the first child was born. Enterprise
became a generational ship. You showed your children how to operate and
maintain it's systems, and they did the same for their children.
ARCHER: You've been flying around the Expanse for over a century?
T'POL: That's unlikely. Enterprise doesn't have fuel or provisions for
such a long journey.
LORIAN: You've hardly changed, mother.
T'POL: I beg your pardon?
LORIAN: You made alliances with other species, traded technology for
food and supplies. You even acquired a few alien crew members. We did
our best to carry out the mission you gave us, Captain.
ARCHER: To destroy the first Xindi probe. But you failed.
LORIAN: We had years to prepare, but in the end we were only one
starship. Our weapons were no match for the Xindi. We couldn't stop the
first attack, but we can help you stop the second. We can make certain
you reach the rendezvous with Degra this time.
T'POL: You said we couldn't travel through the corridor.
KARYN: You won't need to. We've encountered dozens of species. Some of
them shared their propulsion technology with us.
(She hands over a PADD.)
LORIAN: We got these schematics from Haridan traders. We can use them
to modify your injector assembly. You'll be able to travel at warp six
point nine for brief intervals.
T'POL: The hull wasn't designed for that speed.
LORIAN: We'll show you how to reinforce structural integrity. You'll be
able to reach Degra in less than two days.
ARCHER: You've made these modifications on your own ship?
LORIAN: Our plasma injectors are too old. They can't handle the stress.
But your injectors are practically new. You're still not convinced.
ARCHER: You've got to admit, it's a lot to accept.
LORIAN: We don't have a lot of time. You need to start these
modifications.
ARCHER: I'm not comfortable doing that just yet.
KARYN: Perhaps we should go to Sickbay. Phlox can confirm our identity.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: They are who they claim to be. Most of the
young woman's ancestors were human, but there are also chromosomes from
three species I've never seen before. These genetic markers belong to
you, Captain. She would appear to be your great grand-daughter. I've
compared your genetic profile with Lorian's. These base pair sequences
could only have come from you.
T'POL: These chromosomes are human.
PHLOX: That's correct. They came from his father.
T'POL: That's impossible. Vulcans and humans have never been able to
reproduce.
PHLOX: According to Lorian, I discovered, or rather I will discover, a
method of successfully combining human and Vulcan genomes.
ARCHER: Who's the father?
PHLOX: Commander Tucker.
 Captain's starlog, supplemental. I've decided to
proceed with Lorian's plan to modify our warp engines. Both ships have
moved a safe distance from the nebula to avoid conflict with the
Kovaalans.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: It's the strangest thing. I look at you
and I see my father. Right here, around the eyes. Now the ears, those
are your mothers. Wait a minute, you smiled.
LORIAN: I wasn't raised with the same inhibitions most Vulcans have. My
human side has allowed me to find a balance between emotion and logic.
I've even been known to tell a joke on occasion. Would you hand me the
coil spanner? I learned almost everything I know by studying your
engineering logs.
TUCKER: Pretty dry reading. I hope I gave you some hands-on training as
well.
LORIAN: I'm sure you would have. You should reinitialise the start-up
routine before going to warp six.
TUCKER: There's something you're not telling me.
LORIAN: You died when I was fourteen.
TUCKER: What happened?
LORIAN: I'm not sure we should be discussing your future.
TUCKER: It couldn't have been easy growing up without the old man
around. Sorry I wasn't there.
LORIAN: You were a good father. It's strange being able to tell you
that.
[Deleted scene]
TUCKER: Maybe you could tell me more about your mother. How the two of
us got together.
LORIAN: She never told me. Mother rarely talked about you. I think it
was too painful. She cared for you a great deal.
TUCKER: Doesn't seem like we're talking about the same T'Pol.
LORIAN: Your relationship was somewhat contentious. But you were always
affectionate towards each other.
TUCKER: I just can't see myself married to her. I suppose if we were
marooned on a desert island.
LORIAN: We should finish up with these injectors. 
 [E2 Corridor]
 KARYN: We've doubled the efficiency of our
atmosphere processors. We can give you those specs too.
ARCHER: Thanks. Starfleet will be glad to hear Enterprise was built to
last.
BOY: Thanks.
(Archer gives him his ball back.)
ARCHER: Wasn't that boy Denobulan?
KARYN: Many of our crew are descendants of Phlox. He and Amanda had
nine children.
ARCHER: You're not entirely human yourself.
KARYN: My great grandmother was Ikaaran.
ARCHER: Was that?
KARYN: Your wife. Her name was Esilia. You rescued her ship from an
anomaly field.
ARCHER: You know, finding your ship explains a few things. When the
Xindi took me prisoner they asked me one question over and over. They
wanted to know how many ships Starfleet had in the Expanse.
KARYN: I'm sure they've picked us up on their sensors more than once.
(she turns right unexpectedly)
ARCHER: I thought we were going to the Bridge.
KARYN: There's someone who'd like to see you first.
 [E2 - T'Pol's quarters]
 T'POL: Hello, Jonathan.
ARCHER: T'Pol.
(She's old, her hands shake, but they sort of embrace.)
T'POL: It's good to see you.
ARCHER: Living with humans for so long has changed you. They didn't
tell me you were still aboard.
T'POL: You mean, still alive. You look well. How's Trip?
ARCHER: He's fine. If you'd like, I'll have him come by and say hello.
T'POL: That might be awkward.
ARCHER: There's so much I want to ask you. I don't know where to start.
T'POL: I wish we had time to get reacquainted.
(She hands him a PADD.)
T'POL: You must give this to your Science Officer. She'll know what it
means.
 [Mess hall]
 HOSHI: Two, a boy and a girl. Toru and Yoshiko.
TRAVIS: Who's the father?
HOSHI: I don't know. It was probably in their database but I didn't
look it up.
TRAVIS: Why not? You've got to be curious.
HOSHI: Some things are better left a mystery. How about you, did you
get married?
TRAVIS: Corporal Mackenzie.
HOSHI: A MACO? How well do you know her?
TRAVIS: We talked after a training session once.
HOSHI: Yeah? You should ask her out.
REED: Is this taken?
TRAVIS: Please.
HOSHI: So, Lieutenant, who'd you end up with? On the other Enterprise.
Did you get married, have kids?
REED: No. Actually, I didn't. Apparently the Reed family line came to a
rather unceremonious end. You'd think on a ship quite this size I'd
have been able to find someone, but.
HOSHI: Women only make up a third of the crew. There were bound to be a
few bachelors left over.
REED: Yeah, and it would appear I'm going to be one of them.
TRAVIS: I'm on duty in a few minutes.
HOSHI: Me too. See you later, sir.
(They leave, and a blonde crewwoman comes in looking around.)
REED: This seat's available.  [Ready room]
 T'POL: She thinks that Lorian's plan won't work.
T'Pol found a discrepancy in his calculations. If we exceed warp five
point six the injectors could start to overload. We'd be destroyed.
ARCHER: Have you shown that to Trip?
T'POL: He agrees with the assessment.
ARCHER: We'll have to contact Degra, tell him we won't be able to make
the rendezvous.
T'POL: There is an alternative. The subspace corridor.
ARCHER: We'll be thrown back in time.
T'POL: Not necessarily. T'Pol spent many years examining their sensor
logs from the incident. She believes it's possible to reconfigure our
impulse manifolds. It should prevent the corridor from destabilising.
ARCHER: How long will it take?
T'POL: About twelve hours.
 [E2 - Lorian's quarters]
(Archer shows Lorian the PADD.)
 ARCHER: You should have told me. My ship could be
destroyed.
LORIAN: There's only a twenty two percent chance of an overload.
ARCHER: I'd call that a damn big risk.
LORIAN: There's no alternative. You'll be thrown into the past if you
try to use the corridor.
ARCHER: I've got two T'Pols who disagree with you.
LORIAN: The Kovaalans will attack Enterprise the moment it enters the
nebula. If they damage your manifolds, the corridor will destabilise
again.
ARCHER: It's our best option.
LORIAN: You have to listen to me.
ARCHER: This is my mission and my decision.
LORIAN: Saving Earth is my mission as much as yours.
ARCHER: I didn't come over here for a debate. I've already given the
order. Trip's short-handed in Engineering. If you could spare a few
people he'd get the work done faster.
LORIAN: You're the Captain.
 [E2 - T'Pol's quarters]
 LORIAN: You shouldn't have spoken to Archer.
T'POL: He had a right to know the risks. Why didn't you tell him?
LORIAN: If they use that corridor their mission will fail. Earth will
be destroyed.
T'POL: You're allowing your human side to get the better of you.
LORIAN: You know nothing about being human.
T'POL: I know that for them guilt can be a powerful motivator. Don't
let it cloud your judgment.
LORIAN: Maybe you'd be a little more concerned if Vulcan was in danger,
and not Earth.
 [E2 - Command centre]
 LORIAN: We'll meet with Degra. I'll speak to the
Xindi Council.
KARYN: But Degra's not expecting us.
LORIAN: Archer's following the same course of action he did before.
He's not going to be at the rendezvous.
KARYN: But the plan could work.
LORIAN: We can't just sit here and hope he succeeds. Billions of lives
are at stake.
GREER: How are we supposed to reach Degra? We can't sustain warp six,
our injectors are too old.
LORIAN: We're going to use the injectors from Archer's ship.
KARYN: Do you expect him to simply give them to us?
LORIAN: No.
KARYN: You're going to steal them? Their warp drive will be disabled.
LORIAN: My father's a resourceful engineer. He'll be able to fabricate
new injectors.
KARYN: You're asking me to betray Jonathan Archer.
LORIAN: I know this won't be easy, but we've had to make difficult
choices before. Our parents and grandparents lived and died aboard this
ship to ensure that someday we would be able to stop the Xindi. This is
our time. If Earth is going to survive, we have to act.
 [Engineering annex]
 TUCKER: Have you spent any time talking to Lorian?
T'POL: Not really.
TUCKER: You should. He seems like a good kid.
T'POL: He's hardly a kid. He's more than a hundred years old.
TUCKER: Only in the Expanse could I have a son who's nearly three times
my age. Who would have thought you and me, huh? Lorian says we're going
to be married in a traditional Vulcan ceremony. It's going to take me
weeks to learn to pronounce the vows. You know where we're going to
have our honeymoon? Cargo bay three. He says I'll fill it up with sand
that we dug up from a passing asteroid. I'm even supposed to (laughs)
I'm even supposed to manufacture a palm tree.
T'POL: It's ridiculous to assume those events are going to happen. Hand
me the flux coupler.
TUCKER: Aren't you at all curious about how you and I are supposed to
end up together?
T'POL: The fact that our counterparts married doesn't mean that we'll
do the same.
TUCKER: You're afraid to admit that under the right circumstances you
could have feelings for me. Maybe you have them already.
T'POL: I should have known this was a mistake.
TUCKER: What?
T'POL: Exploring human sexuality with you. You're obviously unable to
have a physical relationship without developing an emotional
attachment.
TUCKER: You know, all the other women on board must have been taken,
because I can't imagine any other reason why I would have married
someone as stubborn as you. I'll go help Rostov with the port manifold.
You seem to have everything under control. [Deleted scene - Sickbay]
ARCHER: Doctor?
PHLOX: Captain. (he's putting together a box of supplies) Their Sickbay
is in poor shape, and they're short on critical medical supplies. So,
with your permission?
ARCHER: Whatever we can spare.
PHLOX: I can't believe this. My Rigellian parrot is still alive. I knew
they had long lifespans, but
ARCHER: You mentioned something about inoculations.
PHLOX: Oh, yes. Eight members of their crew are suffering from
low-grade Nubilian fever. I'd like to vaccinate everyone on both ships.
Their physician, and I use that term generously, is very inexperienced.
And I'd like some time to give him a refresher course in viral
propagation.
ARCHER: Do what you can. (turns to leave)
PHLOX: It's remarkable, isn't it? Discovering an extended family that
you never knew existed. Did you know that I have nearly thirty living
descendants on that ship? I look forward to introducing them to my
wives on Denobula.
ARCHER: I suppose when this mission is over, most of their crew will
want to return to Earth.
PHLOX: From what I've gathered, your great grand-daughter would be more
at home on the bridge of a starship.
ARCHER: We seem to be cut from the same cloth.
PHLOX: Perhaps Starfleet will consider allowing children on board
starships one day. Admiral Forrest did let you bring Porthos.
ARCHER: I can imagine the look on the Admiral's face when he sees two
Enterprises pulling into Spacedock. Keep me updated.[Engineering]
 (The E2 crew have knocked out the Enterprise
engineers and are accessing the injectors.)
LORIAN: Injectors are still online. Greer,
 [Relay control]
 LORIAN [OC]: how much longer?
GREER: It's taking more time than we thought to reroute the plasma.
 [Engineering]
 GREER [OC]: Stand by.
TUCKER: I want those starboard modules recalibrated first.
LORIAN: (after the crewman Trip was talking to is shot) Hold your fire.
TUCKER: What the hell are you doing?
GREER [OC]: Greer to Lorian.
 [Relay control]
 GREER: The flow's been diverted.
 [Engineering]
 LORIAN: Get back to the ship. (the injectors are
removed) Go.
TUCKER: We won't be able to go to warp without those injectors!
LORIAN: Archer gave me no other option.
TUCKER: Take some advice from your old man. You don't want to do this.
CREWMAN: He'll alert the others.
LORIAN: I'm sorry.
(he stuns Tucker.)
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: What's wrong?
TRAVIS: Warp engines just went offline. Our plasma injectors are
disengaged.
ARCHER: Archer to Engineering. Trip, respond. Send a security team.
HOSHI: They've undocked.
ARCHER: Hail them.
HOSHI: No response.
REED: They're preparing to go to warp.
ARCHER: Disable their engines.
 [E2 - Bridge]
 KARYN: They're targeting our nacelles.
LORIAN: Take us to warp.
KARYN: I can't. They've knocked out the starboard power couplings.
LORIAN: Get us out of here, full impulse. Return fire.
 [Bridge]
 REED: Hull plating at sixty one percent.
TRAVIS: They're making a run for it.
ARCHER: Stay with them.
REED: They have the same complement of weapons as we do.
T'POL: We would appear to be evenly matched.
ARCHER: (to T'Pol) Get down to the transporter, and stand by.
 [E2 - Bridge]
 (As the twin ships engage in a graceful
dog-fight.)
LORIAN: Bring us in low, underneath them. Target their hull plating
relays.
 [Bridge]
 REED: We've lost hull plating.
ARCHER: T'Pol?
 [Transporter alcove]
 T'POL: I can't establish a lock.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL [OC]: We need to get closer.
ARCHER: You heard her.
HOSHI: We've lost power on C deck.
REED: Weapons are gone.
TRAVIS: Two thousand metres.
ARCHER: T'Pol!
(She beams aboard a piece of equipment.)
 [E2 - Bridge]
 GREER: Sir, our weapons are losing power. Archer's
using the transporter. They've taken one of our EPS manifolds.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Now lock onto their primary relays.
They're on
 [Transporter]
 ARCHER [OC]: C deck, junction twelve.
T'POL: Acknowledged.
(Another chunk of hardware arrives.)
 [E2 - Bridge]
 KARYN: We're losing main power.
ARCHER [OC]: This is Captain Archer. Looks like we've got some things
that belong to each other.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Why don't we call a truce and return our
respective property.
REED: Sir, they still have one torpedo in the forward tube. It's locked
onto our starboard engine.
ARCHER: I know you've got your finger on the trigger.
 [E2 - Bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: If you fire that torpedo, you're
going to hurt a lot of people over here.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Lorian,
 [E2 - Bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: Answer me.
KARYN: We can't do this.
LORIAN: There's too much at stake.
KARYN: These people are family. I'm not going to let you kill them.
Captain, it's over.
LORIAN: Stand down weapons. Tell Archer I want to talk.
 [Brig]
 ARCHER: You were lucky. Phlox says the injuries on
both ships were minor. You almost crippled us. My mission would have
been over.
LORIAN: Your mission is over, Captain. You just won't accept it. I took
the only logical course of action.
ARCHER: Attacking your ancestors doesn't sound very logical to me.
LORIAN: You wouldn't understand. You can't. You don't know what it's
like living with the responsibility. Millions of people are dead
because of me.
ARCHER: I'm sure your crew did everything they could to stop the probe.
LORIAN: I could have destroyed it. Years ago, I swore to my Captain on
his deathbed I'd save those seven million lives. You were the man I
made that promise to. I devoted my life to that mission. We knew the
co-ordinates of the launch platform, the exact minute the weapon was
going to be deployed. But our plan didn't work. I had one last chance.
Use Enterprise itself, set a collision course with the probe. But I
hesitated, my emotions took over. I couldn't give an order that would
kill my crew. By the time I realised my mistake it was too late, the
probe was gone. I won't let my emotions get in the way again. I will
not let Earth be destroyed.
(Archer opens the cell door and goes in.)
ARCHER: I could keep you locked up in here, but that wouldn't do either
of us any good. All that matters is what we're going to do next.
Whether you agree with it or not, I'm taking my ship into that
corridor. And I'll stand a much better chance of completing this
mission, our mission, if we work together.
 [E2 - T'Pol's quarters]
 T'POL2: (the older one) Come in.
T'POL1: (the younger one) Am I disturbing you?
T'POL2: Not at all. Please. Tea?
T'POL1: Chamomile?
T'POL2: Of course.
T'POL1: We had trouble with your modifications. We were only able to
reduce our particle wake by eighty six percent. The corridor could
destabilise again.
T'POL2: If you place an isomagnetic collector here it should absorb any
residual particles.
T'POL1: I'm not familiar with that type of device.
T'POL2: Something we picked up from the Ikaarans.
(She goes to her computer console.)
T'POL2: I should be able to find the schematics. Are you feeling
better?
T'POL1: What do you mean?
T'POL2: Your trellium addiction. Have the symptoms diminished?
T'POL1: To a degree, but I haven't fully recovered.
T'POL2: You'll never fully recover. The emotions you've accessed will
be with you the rest of your life. Ah, here we are. Don't forget your
tea. You're going to have to learn to embrace them, live with them as I
have. There's someone on your ship who can help.
T'POL1: Phlox has already given me a neural suppressant.
T'POL2: I don't mean Phlox. Trip can be an outlet for these feelings if
you'll trust him. The emotions he stirred in me were powerful and
frightening. I tried to push him away. If Enterprise hadn't been
stranded in the past it's possible I never would have married Trip, but
I can't imagine what my life would have been like without him.
T'POL1: What do you suggest I do?
T'POL2: There's a human expression, follow your heart.
(She hands over the schematics.)
T'POL1: What if my heart doesn't know what it wants?
T'POL2: It will, in time. It will.
 [Bridge]
 (Back at the nebula.)
REED: Weapons are standing by.
ARCHER: Take us in. Are the signatures being reflected?
T'POL: I'm reading multiple images.
ARCHER: How long until we reach the corridor.
TRAVIS: Six minutes.
REED: They've detected us. Three ships are on an intercept course.
(weapons fire hits Enterprise)
ARCHER: Return fire.
REED: The nebula's interfering with our targeting scanners. We'll have
to wait until they get closer.
ARCHER: They don't seem to be having the same problem.
REED: Aft plating's at forty two percent.
ARCHER: Malcolm!
REED: Just a few more seconds, sir. We have a lock.
ARCHER: Archer to Lorian. Now!
(We get a view from above, of the second ship peeling off from
underneath ours and turning to engage the attackers.)
REED: The lead ship's been disabled. The other two are falling back.
ARCHER: Well done, Captain.
 [E2 -Bridge]
 LORIAN: They must have been surprised when your
reflection turned and attacked.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Sir, we're losing speed.
TUCKER [OC]: Tucker to the Bridge.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: The last torpedo took out the primary
drive coil.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER [OC]: I've got to shut down the port
engine.
ARCHER: Understood. Lorian, it looks like we're not going to be able to
 [E2 - Bridge]
 ARCHER [OC]: keep up with you.
KARYN: The aliens are regrouping. Four ships.
LORIAN: Bring us a hundred metres off Archer's bow. Power the tractor
emitters. Captain, tell your crew to brace themselves.
 [Bridge]
 (E2's tractor beam grabs Enterprise and hauls it
along.)
TRAVIS: We're increasing speed. They've engaged a tractor beam.
ARCHER: Thanks for the lift. We'll see you on the other side.
REED: Sir, the Kovaalans will be in weapons range in less than twenty
seconds.
 [E2 - Bridge]
 KARYN: The aliens are closing. Twelve thousand
metres, ten thousand.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Target their weapons.
 [E2 - Bridge]
 GREER: Hull plating's holding.
LORIAN: What about Archer?
GREER: Their aft plating's almost gone.
LORIAN: See if we can get the alien's attention. Torpedoes. full
spread.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: We've lost aft plating.
TRAVIS: Forty five seconds to the corridor.
REED: Weapons are down.
 [E2 - Bridge]
 GREER: They're targeting Archer's reactor.
LORIAN: Disengage the tractor beam. New course, one eight zero mark
zero.
(E2 sling-shots Enterprise into the corridor and engages the enemy.)
 [Bridge]
 LORIAN [OC]: We'll keep them off your back. Your
momentum will carry you into the corridor.
 [E2 - Bridge]
 LORIAN: We'll follow as soon as we can. Tell my
parents that I'll see them soon.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Twelve seconds to the corridor.
 [E2 - Bridge]
 KARYN: Direct hit. The pylons are starting to
buckle.
LORIAN: Reserve power to hull plating.
 [Bridge]
 (Enterprise enters the subspace corridor.)
T'POL: Hull integrity's failing.
 [E2 - Bridge]
 (With explosions all around them.)
GREER: Forward launchers are gone.
LORIAN: Divert everything to the phase cannons. Continue firing.
 [Bridge]
 (Enterprise emerges from the subspace corridor.)
REED: No sign of pursuit.
ARCHER: Where are we?
T'POL: We've travelled eleven point six light years.
ARCHER: Are we still in the right century?
TRAVIS: The stars are where they're supposed to be.
ARCHER: What about Lorian?
REED: No sign of him yet, sir.
 Captain's starlog, supplemental. It's been five
hours, and the other Enterprise still hasn't arrived. Repairs to our
impulse drive are underway.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: One ship against four.
T'POL: It's unlikely they survived.
ARCHER: Lorian has years of command experience. Something tells me we
shouldn't write him off yet. I suppose there's another possibility.
Since we weren't thrown into the past, maybe history somehow corrected
itself.
T'POL: Are you suggesting that the other Enterprise never existed? If
you're right, then why would we remember them?
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
HOSHI [OC]: Could you come out here, sir?
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: A ship's dropping out of warp.
HOSHI: It's Degra. He's hailing us.
ARCHER: Put him up.
DEGRA [on viewscreen]: Captain, you're early.

  T'POL
[OC]: Previously on Enterprise
 DANIELS [Enterprise
J]: We're four hundred years in the future.
ARCHER: You know about the alien we found, the test subject?
DANIELS: He belongs to the same race that built the Spheres. They're
altering this space to make it habitable for their species. You have to
make the Xindi understand that humanity isn't the enemy.
DEGRA [Degra's ship]: The
weapon won't be launched for several days. Show us your proof.
DEGRA [Sickbay]: You're
saying the Expanse will no longer be compatible for us.
PHLOX: For any of us.
ARCHER [Ready room]: We're
destined to form an alliance to stop them.
DEGRA: You need to speak to the Council. With the evidence you've shown
me they'll have no choice but to take us seriously.
BUILDER [Xindi Council Chamber]: If it
weren't for my assistance your species would be facing destruction.
DEGRA: Is it true your species built the Spheres?
[Degra's ship]
DOLIM [on viewscreen]: Where is Degra?
ARCHER [Bridge]: What
kind of weapons do you have?
DEGRA: You expect me to attack a Reptilian warship?
(Degra's ship blows up the attacker.)
T'POL [OC]: The Reptilian vessel's been destroyed.
DEGRA [on viewscreen]: They would have contacted the Council and
exposed our alliance.
HUMANOID [Degra's ship]:
He'll be killed the moment he steps into the Council chamber.
DEGRA: If Archer is telling the truth, then all the Council's efforts
will be for nothing.
 [Trans-dimensional space]
 (A milky atmosphered place with no points of
reference, just the camera swooping from one white bald female figure
to another.)
BUILDER: We've been successful. The Xindi weapon is days away from
completion.
PRESAGE: The timelines don't support that assessment.
PRIMARY: What have you seen?
PRESAGE: The number of lines with favourable outcomes has diminished.
There is now an increased chance the Earth ship will prevent the weapon
from being launched.
BUILDER: Not necessarily. Timelines are sensitive. They're prone to
temporary fluctuations.
PRESAGE: This is no fluctuation. This is a trajectory away from our
desired outcome.
PRIMARY: See that you take definitive actions to correct this. The
weapon must be launched. Earth must be destroyed.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: I'm not detecting any trellium in your
system. How are you feeling?
T'POL: The emotions are still difficult to control.
PHLOX: Meditation isn't helping?
T'POL: Somewhat, but I'm still experiencing frequent
(The door opens.)
TUCKER: You okay?
T'POL: Just a mild headache.
TUCKER: I thought Vulcans didn't get headaches.
T'POL: I'm needed in the Command centre.
(T'Pol leaves.)
TUCKER: You notice anything strange about the way she's been acting?
PHLOX: There isn't anyone on the ship who hasn't been affected by
recent events. What can I do for you?
TUCKER: I think I pulled a muscle.
(He indicates his left shoulder.)
TUCKER:  Pain's pretty bad.
PHLOX: Have a seat.
TUCKER: We've been running double shifts in Engineering. Captain's in
hell of a rush to get to this damned Council.
PHLOX: He believes he can get the Xindi to reconsider their attack on
Earth. We owe him a little faith.
TUCKER: Oh, I have faith in the Captain, but not in the people he's
trying to convince.
PHLOX: Degra seems to be a reasonable man.
TUCKER: Reasonable? I don't think many people back in my home town
would go along with that.
(Phlox gives an injection.)
TUCKER: Thanks Doc.
 [Command centre]
 T'POL: The Spheres are controlled by a network of
artificial intelligence. This section houses the redundant memory core.
It should contain a significant amount of information.
ARCHER: We're hoping that'll include data on the Sphere Builders.
DEGRA: That could help us with the Council.
T'POL: Our present course will take us close to another Sphere.
ARCHER: I'm sending a crew in a shuttlepod. They'll join up with us
later.
DEGRA: How do you plan to get inside it?
ARCHER: We're pretty sure we've found a way in. You've mentioned the
Xindi have been studying the Spheres for decades.
T'POL: We're interested in any information you have on the construction
of their outer shells.
DEGRA: I'll send over whatever's in my database.
 [Armoury]
 HAWKINS: Sir.
REED: I've been reviewing service transcripts. You've got over a
thousand hours in an EV suit.
HAWKINS: I did six months on the Janus loop.
REED: Are you interested in running this mission with us?
HAWKINS: I'm always ready to stretch my legs, sir.
REED: Get prepped. The Janus. That includes EV combat training.
HAWKINS: Yes, sir. Are we expecting a fire fight?
REED: Don't know what to expect.
(The shuttlepod launches.)
 [Degra's ship]
 DEGRA: When it's finished compiling, send it to
Enterprise.
BUILDER: It's not too late.
DEGRA: Dismissed. Dismissed! (but the crewman only leaves when Builder
nods)
BUILDER: Not everyone has forgotten what we have done for your people.
DEGRA: What do you want?
BUILDER: You've turned away from us. Come back.
DEGRA: I can't.
BUILDER: I hear it in your voice. You have betrayed everything you
believe in and now you're in turmoil.
DEGRA: I don't regret what I'm doing.
BUILDER: At one time or another you must have asked yourself why we've
protected the Xindi for so long.
DEGRA: Many of us have wondered that.
BUILDER: It's because we can see a future where the Xindi are no longer
fragmented, no longer struggling for existence. You are destined to
become a great civilisation, and now it's all in jeopardy because of
you.
DEGRA: No.
BUILDER: You created a device that will prevent a devastating attack.
Your name was to be spoken with reverence for generations to come, and
instead you have chosen the role of betrayer.
DEGRA: How I'm remembered isn't for you to decide.
BUILDER: What have we done to lose your faith?
DEGRA: You never deserved my faith.
 [Ready room]
 DEGRA: The Sphere Builders have lied to the Xindi.
They've manipulated us for decades. I see that. Perhaps the arboreals
will, and the others.
ARCHER: We have the evidence to back it up.
DEGRA: The evidence may not be enough. The Sphere Builders saved the
Xindi from extinction. When our home world was destroyed they began
appearing to the survivors. They'd guide them to habitable planets,
show them the location of valuable resources. They're practically
worshipped. We call them the Guardians.
ARCHER: It's no wonder you had a hard time accepting this.
DEGRA: I was brought up to revere them. I taught my own children to
give thanks to them at the end of each day. That is what we're facing.
ARCHER: I've stood before a Klingon tribunal. I can handle a tough
room.
DEGRA: The Klingons weren't determined to destroy your world. But the
evidence is strong, perhaps it will be enough. We'll face the Council
together. I may take my seat at the Council table, but I'll be at your
side no matter what happens.
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
HOSHI [OC]: We've picked up several Xindi vessels. They're closing on
our position.
DEGRA: Humanoids, arboreals and aquatics. They're with us. When we
reach the Council's location we'll need their protection.
 [Corridor]
 DEGRA: Certain members have more influence than
others.
ARCHER: Anything you can tell me about them. I need to know what I'm up
against.
DEGRA: You know Jannar, the arboreal. He's fair-minded, a scientist,
he'll listen to the facts. I count him as a friend. Unfortunately the
other members are somewhat more complicated. The aquatics for instance.
Kiaphet Amman'sor is a member of the Ibix dynasty, a very wealthy, very
powerful family. Her opinions carry considerable weight when she
arrives at them. There's a saying. It's easier to count the stars in
the sky than it is for an aquatic to reach a decision. As for the
insectoids, well, their names grow longer the older they get, so they
become a little difficult to pronounce. In many ways insectoids are the
opposite of the aquatics.
ARCHER: They're quick to take sides. We've run into them.
DEGRA: Which brings us to the reptilians, and Commander Dolim. There's
a story about him. I don't know if it's true, I'd like to believe it
isn't. His daughter gave birth to a son. He had a deformity in his
right arm, not life-threatening but enough to preclude his ever joining
the military. Commander Dolim had his own grandson poisoned.
ARCHER: From what I've seen that's not hard to believe.
DEGRA: As I said, it may be just a story, but as a father it's always
in the back of my mind whenever I have dealings with him.
 [Reptilian Solar room]
 DOLIM: Enter. What is it?
SOLDIER: We've located debris. It's from the ship we sent to find
Degra.
DOLIM: Where?
SOLDIER: Seven light years from here, within the cloaking barrier of a
Sphere.
DOLIM: I want to know how it was destroyed. Begin an analysis.
SOLDIER: It's underway. Preliminary findings suggest they were
attacked.
DOLIM: Yes.
LIEUTENANT [OC]: Commander, there are six vessels approaching. One is
the Earth ship.
(Degra's ship is in the lead, with Enterprise in the middle of the
diamond formation.)
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 DOLIM: Contact the lead ship.
DEGRA [OC]: This is Degra.
DOLIM: Degra. I was just thinking of you. How many
 [Degra's ship]
 DOLIM [OC]: Prisoners have you taken?
DEGRA: We're escorting Enterprise to the Council.
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 DOLIM: For what purpose?
 [Degra's ship]
 DEGRA: Power down your weapons
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 DEGRA [OC]: And withdraw.
DOLIM: What makes you think I would let you bring an enemy ship into a
security zone?
 [Degra's ship]
 DEGRA: Power down your weapons now.
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 DOLIM: I don't take orders from you.
LIEUTENANT: They've launched a torpedo.
DOLIM: What!
LIEUTENANT: Three hundred metres off the port bow.
DOLIM: You would fire on a Xindi vessel?
 [Degra's ship]
 DEGRA: We're prepared to destroy your vessel if
necessary.
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 LIEUTENANT: They're locking weapons.
DOLIM: Prepare to return fire!
 [Degra's ship]
 DEGRA: You're outnumbered and outgunned. There's
no need for this. I assure
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 DEGRA [OC]: You the Earth ship poses no danger.
DOLIM: I'll see you in the Council chamber.
 [Degra's ship]
 DEGRA: I look forward to it.
 [Shuttlepod]
 TRAVIS: Five seconds, three, two.
(The pod passes into cloaking barrier and something goes bang.)
TRAVIS: RCS inverter.
T'POL: Shut it down.
(They make it through.)
REED: Damage?
TRAVIS: Nothing we need to worry about sir.
T'POL: Adjust heading oh two six mark three.
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER: I'd breathe a whole lot easier if you had
a couple of MACOs watching your back.
ARCHER: Don't worry. Keep my chair warm.
TUCKER: Good luck.
 [Turbolift]
 ARCHER: How's your Insectoid these days?
HOSHI: It depends on which dialect. There are sixty seven.
ARCHER: Is that all?
 [Degra's shuttle]
 DEGRA: Aquatics respect boldness and confidence.
They view hushed tones with suspicion.
ARCHER: I'll make sure I project.
DEGRA: Not too loudly. The Insectoids interpret raised voices as a sign
of hostility.
HOSHI: When Aquatics use the past tense they switch to sonar.
DEGRA: You should see it in a moment.
ARCHER: We're still two kilometres up.
DEGRA: The only way in is through the air. These cloud layers are
present throughout the year. It's perfectly concealed.
(The buildings are carved into the mountain peaks.)
ARCHER: Avians.
HOSHI: It's beautiful.
DEGRA: The sixth Xindi race. This was built centuries before they
became extinct. According to our archaeologists it's over four thousand
years old.
 [Council corridor]
 ARCHER: Kind of feels like being called to the
Principal's office.
HOSHI: I was never called to the Principal's office.
ARCHER: I was once.
DEGRA: (to Reptilian guards) Move aside.
(They do, reluctantly.)
HOSHI: What for?
ARCHER: When we're done here.
 [Council chamber]
 DOLIM: You've brought humans into this Chamber,
Degra. Explain yourself, if you expect them to leave here alive.
DEGRA: I'm fully prepared to explain my actions. There's no cause for
threats.
JANNAR: Agreed. We've reviewed the data you sent. We're prepared to
listen to what you have to say.
(the Council members all take their places while Archer addresses them
from the top step of the entrance)
ARCHER: You killed seven million of my people. I want to be honest with
you, I don't much like standing here.
JANNAR: We did what we felt was necessary.
ARCHER: I know. You've been told that at some time in the future my
world is going to destroy yours. That's a lie.
(Insectoid outburst.)
HOSHI: He said, the Guardians have never lied to us.
ARCHER: The Guardians built the Spheres. They're reconfiguring the
Expanse, preparing it for colonisation.
DOLIM: You reek of desperation. You would say anything to save your
world, as evidenced by this manufactured data.
DEGRA: It's the truth. The data is accurate. Anyone with an objective
eye will come to the same conclusion.
DOLIM: You have no idea what the truth is. Your sympathy for these
humans has corrupted your judgment.
DEGRA: My judgment is perfectly sound.
DOLIM: Were you using sound judgment when you attacked my ship?
DEGRA: You were trying to prevent us from reaching this Council.
DOLIM: I was protecting this Council!
HOSHI: (translating aquatic) This is not relevant. We're here to
discuss the human's claims.
HUMANOID: Agreed. We need to return to the subject at hand.
ARCHER: I am trying to save my world, but it's not just Earth that's in
danger. If you wipe out mankind you'll be destroying yourself.
DOLIM: I refuse to listen to any more of this.
ARCHER: Earth is going to lead a battle that defeats the Sphere
Builders. They know this. That's why they manipulated you into
attacking us.
DOLIM: Enough! I demand the immediate seizure of the Earth ship.
DEGRA: Any vessel that attacks Enterprise will be fired upon.
DOLIM: You will not defy this Council.
HUMANOID: We haven't arrived at a decision yet.
DOLIM: And we never will as long as we listen to this human's lies. If
this Council will not defend it's people then it has no reason to
exist. (starts to walk out)
DEGRA: Wait.
(Dolim punches him, Archer goes to help and is pushed over by the
Insectoid. Hoshi translates what the Insectoid said to
Archer.)
HOSHI: You don't want to know.
 [Shuttlepod]
 T'POL: Hold this position. The exhaust vent.
REED: Where?
T'POL: Set a course, oh three one mark four.
(Reed peers hard at the Sphere.)
REED: I don't see an exhaust vent.
TRAVIS: You sure about this?
T'POL: Half thrusters.
(The shuttlepod heads straight for the Sphere.)
REED: T'Pol!
T'POL: Hold your course.
REED: I'm telling you!
T'POL: Hold your course.
(They fly through a section of the Sphere.)
HAWKINS: Some kind of hologram?
T'POL: Exactly.
REED: You could have warned us ahead of time.
T'POL: Proceed along this conduit.
TRAVIS: Aye.
(They enter the central chamber.)
T'POL: Sixty degrees starboard. Eighty degrees z axis. We should
prepare for EVA.
REED: Let's break out the suits.
 [Degra's quarters]
 JANNAR: We've had difficult sessions before. In
the days following the founding of this Council
HUMANOID: This is different. The Council is on the verge of tearing
itself apart.
JANNAR: You underestimate us.
HUMANOID: We were all in the same room. You saw what happened.
DEGRA: We knew it wasn't going to be easy.
HUMANOID: We are never going to convince the Reptilians or the
Insectoids.
ARCHER: Then we'll focus on the aquatics.
DEGRA: The Aquatics weigh every argument in excruciating detail. For a
long time, they were against building the weapon.
ARCHER: What changed their minds?
JANNAR: The Guardians addressed the Council. They presented what they
claimed was a visual record taken from the future.
DEGRA: It showed mankind destroying our new homeworld.
JANNAR: That convinced the aquatics.
DEGRA: It was powerful evidence.
(Archer looks at a skull.)
JANNAR: The Avians. Once they darkened the skies of Xindus with their
numbers. We formed the Council to prevent other Xindis from sharing
their fate.
ARCHER: Your Council just might have the opposite effect.
DEGRA: Perhaps not. There might be a way to convince them. I'll require
the services of your ship's Doctor.
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 BUILDER: The Council is preparing to betray it's
own people.
DOLIM: Archer has achieved nothing.
BUILDER: He has succeeded in raising doubts about us. The arboreals,
humanoids and aquatics are considering what he had to say. He should
never have been allowed before the Council.
DOLIM: I couldn't prevent it.
BUILDER: And now they may decide against launching the weapon.
DOLIM: The weapon will be deployed.
BUILDER: For that to happen, three of the Xindi species must agree.
LIEUTENANT: If we can prove to them that your people didn't build the
Spheres.
BUILDER: Prove to them, or you?
DOLIM: My Lieutenant simply wants to know that there's a way to
persuade the Council.
BUILDER: Persuasion is no longer a viable option. You must act with the
insectoids. Secure the weapon.
DOLIM: The weapon's well guarded. The casualties on both sides would be
heavy. We'd be risking civil war.
BUILDER: A temporary schism cannot be avoided, but eventually
Reptilians will preside over a stronger unified Xindi empire. We will
guarantee Reptilian dominance if humankind is eradicated.
DOLIM: Understood.
(The Builder vanishes and he goes to his Lieutenant.)
DOLIM: If you ever question the Guardians again your skin will adorn
the bow of this ship.
 [Sickbay]
 DEGRA: Yes, this will be very helpful.
(The images of the dying alien from Harbinger.)
PHLOX: I'll have it sent over immediately. I've never heard of this
procedure.
DEGRA: It was developed by the aquatics. They have an innate distrust
of the spoken word. They respond more strongly to visual stimuli.
TUCKER: (entering) You need me for something?
PHLOX: The transport pod that carried this alien?
TUCKER: It's in the cargo bay.
PHLOX: There are some modifications that need to be made to it.
DEGRA: The Captain would like you to assist me with the work.
TUCKER: Lucky me.
DEGRA: Your Captain thinks there's no one better to make these
modifications.
 [Corridor]
 DEGRA: I agree.
TUCKER: Do me a favour. Don't try to get on my good side.
DEGRA: I understand you and I will always be enemies.
TUCKER: You got that right.
DEGRA: I can't change what happened to your sister or any of the seven
million but I'm risking my life, I'm risking the lives of my family,
I've killed members of my own species, all because I'm trying to save
both our worlds.
TUCKER: This way.
 [Inside the Sphere]
 (The away team are clambering through the
structure at the middle of the Sphere.)
REED: Picking up a very powerful energy signature.
T'POL: We're approaching the memory core.
 [Shuttlepod]
 T'POL [OC]: It's fifteen metres ahead.
(Travis is monitoring their progress.)
 [Inside the Sphere]
 (Looking down at their objective.)
REED: It's practically gift-wrapped.
(They don't notice some kid of metal arm coming from the ceiling.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 TRAVIS: I'm detecting some kind of movement.
REED [OC]: Can you pin-point it?
TRAVIS: There's too much interference. I don't know where it is
 [Inside the Sphere]
 TRAVIS [OC]: But it's close.
REED: I suggest we work fast.
 [Ready room]
 ARCHER: Come in.
DEGRA: We've completed the work. Mister Tucker was extremely
co-operative. I know it isn't easy for him, working with me.
(He turns to leave again.)
ARCHER: Degra, when I was on the future Enterprise four hundred years
from now, there were Xindi aboard. Humans and Xindi were serving
together in the Federation. That's a future worth fighting for.
 [Council corridor]
 ARCHER: Passing notes.
HOSHI: Sir?
ARCHER: I got sent to the Principal's office for passing a note in
class. It was to Katy Bentley. I was inviting her to a party a friend
of mine was throwing.
HOSHI: What'd she say?
ARCHER: Funny thing. She'd already turned me down, but after I got in
trouble.
HOSHI: Some women can't resist the bad boys.
 {Council chamber]
 JANNAR: After much deliberation we've agreed to
listen to this new evidence you wish to present.
HUMANOID: Proceed.
ARCHER: The Sphere Builders, the beings you call the Guardians, are the
same species.
DOLIM: Have you manufactured more data to support this claim?
ARCHER: A few weeks ago we came across an alien. He was adrift in what
we believe was a transdimensional disturbance. The alien was inside a
pod which was constructed of the same combination of alloys that make
up the outer shell of the Spheres. He was a Sphere Builder.
HOSHI: (translating aquatic) You've already presented this information.
ARCHER: Not all of it. Energise.
(The alien's pod is beamed into the centre of the council chamber, and
appears to have a body inside it.)
JANNAR: Your data states that this alien disintegrated when it came
into contact with our universe.
ARCHER: He did.
DEGRA: What you're seeing is a biometric hologram. It's the same
technology used to train our physicians. It was constructed from
medical data collected by Enterprise's medical doctor.
HOSHI: (translating Insectoid) How do we know the data used to create
this phantom wasn't falsified.
DEGRA: Humans don't have the technology to produce a fabrication of
this detail.
ARCHER: Tell me, is this one of the Guardians?
JANNAR: The physical resemblance is hard to deny.
HOSHI: (translating aquatic) It is a Guardian. (translating Insectoid)
We are not deceived by this illusion. Restore the dignity of our
Council. Expel the humans from this chamber.
DOLIM: We are open to hearing more.
JANNAR: So are we.
HOSHI: [translating aquatic) We agree.
JANNAR: Please, continue.
 [Inside the Sphere]
 REED: Reed to Shuttlepod one. Anything?
TRAVIS [OC]: No sir.
 [Shuttlepod]
 TRAVIS: Whatever it was, it's stopped moving. Got
something! It's heading in your direction.
 [Inside the Sphere]
 TRAVIS [OC]: Moving fast.
REED: I don't see anything.
HAWKINS: Where is it?
 [Shuttlepod]
 HAWKINS [OC]: Give me a position.
TRAVIS: It's coming down from the upper
 [Inside the Sphere]
 TRAVIS [OC]: left quadrant.
REED: Are you sure?
TRAVIS [OC]: Damn sure.
 [Shuttlepod]
 TRAVIS: It's seventy metres away. Fifty metres,
thirty, fifteen!
 [Inside the Sphere]
 HAWKINS: I see it.
(he climbs a ladder to fire at the mechanical hand device. It grabs
him.)
REED: Hawkins!
(The hand disintegrates the valiant MACO.)
REED: (to T'Pol) Go! Go!
(A second hand grabs for T'Pol and the memory core, but Reed blows it
away. The shuttlepod moves in to pick them up.)
 [Shuttlepod]
 TRAVIS: Five more headed this way. Move!
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: I still can't pin down the problem with
the converter. I think it's an energy drain somewhere. We're far from
one hundred percent.
(Degra enters with the humanoid Xindi.)
DEGRA: There's been a development.
ARCHER: Dismissed.
HUMANOID: We have the three votes we need.
DEGRA: The Reptilians have agreed to postpone the launch of the weapon.
They'll need more convincing before they solidify their position, but
this is a significant step. That future you spoke of. Perhaps this is
where it begins.
(Degra and Archer shake hands.)
TUCKER: Question. Those portable power cells you left us. We're having
a little trouble getting them in synch. Think you can stick around for
a few minutes, give us a hand?
DEGRA: Of course.
ARCHER: We'll be in my Ready room.
(Archer and the humanoid leave.)
TUCKER: Listen, about all those things I've been saying. I just want to
tell you I know you went out on a limb.
DEGRA: If I had suffered your loss I'd feel the same way. Shall we get
to work?
TUCKER: It's over here.
 [Degra's quarters]
DEGRA: Come in. I wasn't expecting you.
DOLIM: There are some things we need to discuss. (looking out of the
window) I've never liked this place.
DEGRA: I've always found it to be peaceful.
DOLIM: It's too exposed. Reptilians prefer to be near the ground. And
then there's the stench.
DEGRA: Stench?
DOLIM: Of failure. Of a race that failed to survive.
DEGRA: I was surprised by your decision to postpone the launch.
DOLIM: It seemed like the right thing to do.
DEGRA: I hope the other members will come to the same conclusion.
DOLIM: They'll fall into line. I have always believed that all Xindi
long for unification. It's in our blood.
DEGRA: I agree.
(Dolim looks at Degra's computer display.)
DOLIM: The Earth ship.
DEGRA: I'm assisting them with their engine repairs.
DOLIM: They've found quite an ally in you. A pity you haven't extended
the same friendship to your fellow Xindi.
DEGRA: What do you mean?
DOLIM: We recovered a sensor encoder from our missing scout ship. It
was in the cloaking barrier of a Sphere. We were able to extract the
final scans it took before they were destroyed by you.
DEGRA: I don't know what you're talking about.
DOLIM: The evidence is irrefutable. We have an image of your ship
firing. Don't try to deny what you did.
DEGRA: They left me no choice.
DOLIM: And you've left me no choice.
(Dolim stabs Degra in the chest.)
DOLIM: The crew of that ship are the last Xindi you'll ever betray.
When the humans have been eliminated, when the Council has been
replaced by reptilian rule, I am going to find your wife and children
and do the same to them. Your traitorous bloodline will end at the tip
of my blade.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: Trouble sleeping?
TUCKER: It's weird. With things finally looking up you'd think I'd
finally be able to get some shut-eye. There's a section of the mess
hall up and running. In the mood for a snack?
PHLOX: Certainly.
 [Corridor]
 TUCKER: I guess you heard, the Captain pulled it
off. The Xindi postponed the weapon launch.
PHLOX: You make that sound like bad news.
TUCKER: Ever since the attack on Earth, all I've thought about is
getting back at whoever was responsible.
PHLOX: Now we are making peace with them.
TUCKER: I've gotten used to the anger. It's going to be like, I don't
know, losing an old friend.
PHLOX: You have other friends.
TUCKER: Is it my imagination or are you losing weight?
PHLOX: Ah, I was hoping someone might notice.
TUCKER: Yeah, I'm not the only one. Hoshi commented on it last week.
PHLOX: Well, I'm pleased to see that my efforts are yielding results.
TUCKER: What's your secret?
PHLOX: A Denaxian tape-worm.
 [Mess hall]
 PHLOX: It attaches itself to the lower intestinal
tract and absorbs nutrients.
TUCKER: Hold on, hold on. You have a worm inside you?
PHLOX: It's perfectly harmless. I hardly notice it at all.
TUCKER: How are you going to get it out?
PHLOX: I insert a standard V probe into my
TUCKER: No, no, no, no, no. Never mind.
PHLOX: Well, it's a simple procedure.
TUCKER: I'm sure it is, Doc. I just don't want to lose my appetite.
 [Archer's quarters]
 (Archer and Porthos are woken by a comm. chime.)
HUMANOID [on monitor]: Degra's dead. He was found in his quarters about
an hour ago. He'd been murdered, stabbed.
ARCHER: Who did this?
HUMANOID [on monitor]: The Reptilians have called an emergency meeting
of the Council. I believe their recent turnabout was nothing more than
a ruse to keep us off guard. They're planning something, I'm certain of
it. Your ship's in danger.
ARCHER: Keep me appraised.
(The communication ends.)
ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge.
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge.
ARCHER: Go to Tactical Alert.
 [Shuttlepod]
 TRAVIS: It was that last run through the cloaking
barrier. The coil assembly's been damaged.
T'POL: Reduce speed. Hold at half impulse.
(Reed drops a locker lid on his finger.)
T'POL@ Lieutenant?
REED: I'm all right. I'm fine. Maybe that's the problem. Maybe we're
getting a bit too comfortable with losing people. Twenty three men and
women. On any given mission the limits of acceptable casualties is
twenty percent. So says traditional military doctrine. Well, we've
crossed that margin.
T'POL: There's a Vulcan axiom. The needs of the many outweigh the needs
of the few. Corporal Hawkins understood that.
REED: That doesn't make his death any more acceptable.
T'POL: No, but it makes it honourable.
 [Council chamber]
 JANNAR: You admit killing him.
DOLIM: With pride. He was a traitor.
HUMANOID: He was a member of this Council.
DOLIM: Degra destroyed a Reptilian ship. Twenty two crewmen died. I
only regret not doing it sooner.
HUMANOID: You're going to regret a lot more than that.
JANNAR: Why did you call this meeting?
DOLIM: You have a decision to make. We've taken control of the weapon.
We're going to launch it.
HUMANOID: And you accuse Degra of being a traitor!
INSECTOID: We are acting on behalf of all Xindi.
DOLIM: Either you stand with us, or you stand against us.
JANNAR: That's not a choice, it's an ultimatum.
DOLIM: Call it what you will.
AQUATIC: We won't submit to intimidation.
HUMANOID: Neither will we.
JANNAR: None of us will.
DOLIM: Then we withdraw from this Council.
JANNAR: Think about what you are doing. This alliance has lasted for
decades.
DOLIM: It's lasted too long. You've become complacent.
HUMANOID: The weapon cannot be launched without three of the codes. You
only have two.
DOLIM: Do you really believe we haven't considered that?
 [Engineering]
 TUCKER: I can give you three point four with a
little coaxing, but some of the relays are still fried. We're in no
shape for combat.
 [Corridor]
 ARCHER: That hasn't stopped us in the past.
TUCKER: You sure they're coming after us?
ARCHER: Count on it.
TUCKER: I can't believe I actually feel bad about Degra. Twenty four
hours ago I would have been celebrating.
ARCHER: A lot can happen in a day.
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Archer.
HOSHI [OC]: Five Insectoid ships are descending toward the surface.
(A circular section of the planet surface splits into four and a big
metal sphere thing comes out.)
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Report.
HOSHI: The weapon's been launched from beneath the surface. The
Insectoid ships are in formation around it.
ARCHER: Pursuit course.
HOSHI: We're being hailed.
 [Degra's ship]
 HUMANOID: The Reptilians and Insectoids have
seized control of the weapon.
ARCHER [OC]: We're tracking it.
HUMANOID: I've ordered all available ships to intercept.
ARCHER [OC]: We're right behind you.
 [Shuttlepod]
 (Going through the data they got from the Sphere.)
REED: I hope there's something in there you can use.
T'POL: Most definitely.
TRAVIS: There's a large group of ships leaving the system. One of them
is Enterprise. I'm detecting weapons fire.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Stay with it. Keep firing.
HOSHI: It's the shuttlepod.
ARCHER: Tell them to stay put, and we'll come back for them when we
can.
(A vigorous space battle takes place around the Xindi weapon.)
ARCHER: Open a channel to Degra's ship. We're moving in on the weapon.
 [Degra's ship]
 HUMANOID: Concentrate your fire on the primary
generators.
 [Bridge]
 HUMANOID [OC]: Six metres below the aft thrusters.
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 DOLIM: Forget the others. Target Enterprise.
(They hit the port nacelle.)
DOLIM: Get the female.
 [Bridge]
(Hoshi is beamed away.)
 ARCHER: Hoshi!
 [DOLIM Bridge]
 LIEUTENANT: They're disabled.
DOLIM: The female?
(A crewman nods.)
LIEUTENANT: Generators at maximum power.
DOLIM: Take us into the vortex.
(The weapon and ships disappear from view.)
 [Bridge]
 HELMSMAN: We've lost them, sir.

Countdown
 Mission date: Feb 13, 2154
Original Airdate: 19 May, 2004
  T'POL
[OC]: Previously on Enterprise
 DEGRA [Command
Centre]: (referring to a sphere) How to you plan to get
inside?
ARCHER: We're pretty sure we've found a way in. I'm sending a crew in a
shuttlepod.
T'POL: The Spheres are controlled by a network of artificial
intelligence. This section houses the redundant memory core. It should
contain a significant amount of information.
ARCHER: We're hoping that'll include data on the Sphere Builders.
([Inside the Sphere, MACO
Hawkins is grabbed and killed by the Sphere defence mechanism.)
REED: Hawkins!
DEGRA [Ready room]: I'll
be at your side no matter what happens.
DOLIM [Xindi Council Chamber: We've
taken control of the weapon. We're going to launch it.
DEGRA [Council Chamber, earlier]: Wait!
(He tries to stop Dolim and he and Archer get hit)
DOLIM [Degra's quarters]: We
have an image of your ship firing.
DEGRA: They left me no choice.
DOLIM: You've left me no choice. (stabs him in the chest) The crew of
that ship are the last Xindi you'll ever betray.
HUMANOID [Xindi Council Chamber]: The
weapon cannot be launched without three of the codes.
DOLIM: Do you really believe we haven't considered that?
ARCHER [Bridge]:
Hoshi!
(She's beamed away.)
 [Reptilian Interrogation room]
 HOSHI: Why am I here? What do you want?
DOLIM: We were impressed with your linguistic abilities. Aquatic is
difficult to master. I've heard it spoken my entire life but still, it
doesn't come easily to me.
HOSHI: Maybe you should have applied yourself more.
DOLIM: We have some encoded data we need translated.
HOSHI: I'm not a cryptologist.
DOLIM: I have confidence in your abilities.
HOSHI: That's very flattering, but you'll have to manage on your own.
DOLIM: If you refuse, we'll have no further use for you. Get her ready
for the procedure.
(Hoshi struggles as she's strapped into a nasty metal chair.)
LIEUTENANT: She's surprisingly strong-willed for a primate.
DOLIM: We'll see how defiant she is after our surgeons have finished
with her. We'll have the launch codes soon enough.
 [Launch bay]
 (The shuttlepod is back safe and sound, and Tucker
opens the hatch. Hayes is with him. T'Pol hands
over a memory core from the Sphere.)
T'POL: We need to access the data from this. Meet me in the
Command centre in half an hour. I'll assist you.
TRAVIS: What have we missed?
TUCKER: The Teptilians took the weapon.
TRAVIS: Have they launched it?
TUCKER: We don't know. The Captain's on his way to the surface, he
wants to figure out our next move. And they took Hoshi. She's gone.
TRAVIS: Who?
TUCKER: Reptilians, Insectoids, we don't know. They transported her off
the Bridge.
(The three leave.)
HAYES: Where's Corporal Hawkins?
REED: The Sphere had an automated defence mechanism. He was killed. I'm
sorry, Major.
HAYES: I'm sure you did everything you could. I'd appreciate a full
report.
 [Degra's quarters]
 ARCHER: Where are they?
HUMANOID: We're trying to determine their location. It's difficult to
track them inside a vortex.
ARCHER: For all you know they could be heading to Earth.
JANNAR: They can't deploy the weapon. Not yet.
HUMANOID: Each of the five species has a set of commands to initiate
the arming sequence. Three of them are needed to activate the weapon.
JANNAR: They only have two. We obviously don't intent to give them
ours.
ARCHER: What about the Aquatics?
HUMANOID: Their actions aren't easy to predict, but so far they seem
determined not to take sides.
JANNAR: It's more likely the Reptilians and Insectoids will attempt to
bypass the command codes themselves.
HUMANOID: And that will take time.
ARCHER: They've abducted my Communications Officer. Up until now I
didn't know why.
JANNAR: You believe they'll use her to decrypt the arming sequence?
ARCHER: She'll never co-operate.
HUMANOID: She may not have a choice.
 [Command centre]
 T'POL: This could be a command subroutine.
TUCKER: And it could be a letter to Santa Claus. I wouldn't mind having
Hoshi here right now.
T'POL: We'll have to make do without her.
TUCKER: I just hope she's okay.
T'POL: We're here to analyse this data, not speculate on Ensign Sato's
fate.
TUCKER: You okay?
T'POL: I'm fond of Hoshi as well, but we can't allow her situation to
become a distraction.
ARCHER: Any luck?
T'POL: There's a great deal of data to analyse, but we've made some
progress. We know the Spheres are connected by a subspace energy grid,
but four of them appear to be integral to that connection.
TUCKER: Closest one's here. We've designated it Sphere Forty One.
ARCHER: Integral how?
T'POL: I believe they act as control Spheres, allowing the network to
operate in concert.
ARCHER: If we can damage one of them, would it disrupt the entire grid?
TUCKER: Maybe. It also might have no effect. We just don't have enough
information yet.
ARCHER: Keep at it.
TUCKER: Aye, sir.
 [Reptilian cell]
 DOLIM: Co-operate and this won't be necessary.
Wait. After the injection, the parasites will invade your neocortex.
Once they begin reconfiguring your synaptic pathways you'll me much
more compliant. Before your primate brain is too badly damaged to
understand, I want to thank you for helping us destroy your world.
(Hoshi spits in his face, then the parasites are injected into her head
and she screams.)
 [Situation room]
 JANNAR: If they'd stayed in the vortex, we
wouldn't have found them.
HUMANOID: They're less than four light years from here.
REED: Why have they stopped? They could have been half way to Earth by
now.
HUMANOID: They're attempting to arm the weapon. The propulsion system
has to be offline to do it.
ARCHER: How quickly can we get there?
JANNAR: That wouldn't be wise. They've been joined by at least a dozen
vessels.
ARCHER: You have nearly as many ships.
HUMANOID: You may have noticed that Reptilians and Insectoids are more
belligerent than we are. Their ships are armed accordingly.
JANNAR: We're no match for them.
REED: We've been out-gunned before, sir. We did not come all this way
to give up without a fight.
ARCHER: Would the Aquatics be a match for them?
HUMANOID: Their ships are extremely powerful, but they've seen your
evidence. They're not convinced.
ARCHER: That was before the reptilians murdered Degra and stole the
weapon. We're looking at civil war. Can they afford to sit back and do
nothing? Let me talk to them.
 [Degra's ship]
 HUMANOID: (to Aquatic on viewscreen) Now isn't the
time to dissolve the Council.
AQUATIC: (something)
HUMANOID: So we should leave our fate in the hands of the Reptilians
and the Insectoids?
AQUATIC: (something)
HUMANOID: I disagree. The evidence the humans provided can't be
ignored.
AQUATIC: (something, then the screen goes blank.)
ARCHER: I didn't quite catch that last part.
HUMANOID: They have agreed to meet with us, but don't expect much,
Captain.
 [Aquatic ship]
 ARCHER: How long do they plan to keep us waiting.
HUMANOID: You have to deal with the Aquatics on their terms.
JANNAR: They're extremely deliberate in everything they do.
ARCHER: You all right?
JANNAR: My species doesn't like the water.
HUMANOID: They're here.
ARCHER: Thank you for seeing me. I'm afraid my Communications Officer
was abducted by the Reptilians.
AQUATIC: That is regrettable, but her presence is no longer necessary.
We've had time to study your language.
ARCHER: Then I'll get to the point. We need your help.
AQUATIC 2: We made our position clear. The evidence is intriguing but
far from conclusive.
AQUATIC: We require more time to evaluate it.
ARCHER: And if my world gets torn to rubble in the meantime?
AQUATIC: The Reptilians and the Insectoids cannot deploy the weapon on
their own.
HUMANOID: That may not be true.
ARCHER: I believe they took my officer to help them decipher a third
launch code. After all your deliberations, you may find a decision's
been made without you.
AQUATIC2: This changes nothing.
AQUATIC: Just because the Reptilians choose to act rashly does not mean
we will do the same.
ARCHER: So you'd rather sit back and do nothing
JANNAR: Captain.
ARCHER: While they condemn all five of your species to extinction.
AQUATIC2: You may return to your ship. You'll be informed of our
decision.
ARCHER: One last question. Have these Guardians told you where you'll
establish your new home world? The ones humans are destined to destroy?
Is it here, in the Expanse? In case you haven't noticed, the Spheres
are turning it into a transdimensional wasteland. None of you will be
able to survive.
(The Aquatics swim away.)
ARCHER: You say the Guardians have helped you. Have they ever tried to
disable the Spheres? Because we've found a way.
(The Aquatics turn around again.)
ARCHER: Help me save my people and I can help you save yours.
 [Weapon control area]
 DOLIM: Report.
LIEUTENANT: She's penetrated the first layer of encryption. Nothing
further.
DOLIM: You understand what we want you to do?
HOSHI: I'm to bypass the Aquatic encryption protocols.
DOLIM: And you realise we need this done quickly.
HOSHI: I'm not familiar with these cyphers. I'm trying.
DOLIM: Are you?
(He pulls her to her feet.)
DOLIM: She's more resistant than I imagined. Prepare her for another
procedure.
(Hoshi tries to run but there's no where to go except jump into the
middle of the weapon. They stop her and haul her back.)
DOLIM: You would sacrifice yourself to stop us. Don't worry. You won't
have to live with your guilt for long.
(She's taken away.)
LIEUTENANT: Commander. I can't access the arming matrix. She's added a
layer of encryption!
DOLIM: You were ordered to watch her.
 [Command centre]
 T'POL: A deflector pulse might disrupt the
subspace links.
TUCKER: It wouldn't generate enough power.
T'POL: We could tie the impulse reactors directly into the array.
TUCKER: Sure, if you want to rupture every EPS conduit on the ship.
T'POL: The Captain told the aquatics we could disable these Spheres.
TUCKER: And I'm trying not to make a liar out of him.
T'POL: Really.
TUCKER: What do you mean by that?
T'POL: You've dismissed all of my proposals.
TUCKER: When you come up with one that doesn't involve blowing
ourselves up, I'll be a little more enthusiastic.
T'POL: Or you might surprise me with an idea of your own.
TUCKER: Maybe you haven't had time to meditate, I don't know, but
whatever's going on with you lately, I've had about enough. I'll work
on this in Engineering. Call me if you have any more brilliant ideas.
(He goes through the door.)
T'POL: Commander, Trip! Everything that's happened recently has caused
me to become slightly emotional.
TUCKER: I've noticed.
T'POL: I apologise.
TUCKER: Forget about it.
T'POL: I wish I could. It may take some time before I regain my
control. It will be difficult to do, especially on my own.
TUCKER: This hasn't been easy for any of us.
(He steps back in and closes the door.)
TUCKER: You know how much I appreciate what you did for me. When this
is all over, if you want to talk, I'm all ears. Why don't we take
another crack at this.
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 DOLIM: The Council has disbanded. The weapon is
under our control.
BUILDER: Excellent. Deploy it immediately.
DOLIM: As soon as we decrypt the third launch code. We've encountered
some difficulties.
BUILDER: The longer you delay, the more likely the time lines will
shift against you.
DOLIM: Then perhaps you can provide more of your valuable assistance.
Help us get the code.
BUILDER: That's not possible.
DOLIM: It should be a simple matter to peer into the past, extract the
necessary data.
BUILDER: We only detect large fluctuations in the timescape. The fine
details are obscured.
DOLIM: Really? You've seen more than enough detail to learn how to
meddle in our affairs, to turn the Xindi species against each other.
BUILDER: Everything we've done has been to protect the Xindi.
DOLIM: Then finish what you've started, if it's within your power.
BUILDER: The time lines are in constant flux. Many of them favour the
Primates and the Arboreals. Some even favour the humans. Unless that's
the outcome you desire I suggest you find a way to launch the weapon.
 [Command centre]
 T'POL: This appears to be some kind of
interspatial manifold on the surface of Sphere Forty One.
ARCHER: What they use to connect the Spheres.
TUCKER: That's what we're thinking. T'Pol's figured out a way to target
it with a deflector pulse.
ARCHER: Well done.
TUCKER: We haven't exactly got all the details worked out yet.
ARCHER: Then you'd better keep at it. If the aquatics decide to help us
they might want to hear those details.
TUCKER: Captain. I hope you didn't make them any promises.
T'POL: We'll keep working.
ARCHER: Please do.
 [Docking hatch corridor]
 ARCHER: Any word?
HUMANOID: It's only been three hours. The Council once needed to
resolve a simple logistical matter. It took the Aquatics six days to
agree to attend the meeting.
ARCHER: I'm surprised you were ever able to get anything done.
HUMANOID: On the contrary. Their prudence was usually the only thing
that kept the Council from dissolving into chaos. That's why Degra had
them build the weapon. He didn't want the reptilians and insectoids to
have too much control.
ARCHER: That's actually something I wanted to discuss with you. If
we're successful, and we destroy the weapon
HUMANOID: What's to prevent us from building another one? I knew Degra
for many years. He could be difficult, uncompromising. We argued often.
For instance, when he insisted that we meet with you. But when Degra
spoke only a fool would ignore him. He believed there was a future
between your people and ours. When this is over, I intend to see if he
was right.
REED [OC]: Captain Archer, please report to the Bridge.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Report.
REED: Six vessels approaching, sir. All aquatic.
HUMANOID: That was remarkably fast.
ARCHER: Open a channel to the lead ship.
AQUATIC2 [on viewscreen]: We've considered your proposal.
ARCHER: And?
AQUATIC [on viewscreen]: We will help you intercept the weapon.
ARCHER: Thank you.
AQUATIC [on viewscreen]: We expect you to honour our agreement.
AQUATIC2 [on viewscreen]: You will attempt to disable the Spheres.
 [Trans-dimensional space]
 BUILDER: How do these developments affect the time
line?
PRESAGE: It's difficult to say. They continue to fluctuate. However,
most now indicate the humans will prevail.
PRIMARY: Then the time has come for us to intervene.
 [Weapon control area]
 DOLIM: Is there another problem?
LIEUTENANT: Quite the opposite.
DOLIM: The third launch code.
LIEUTENANT: We have complete access.
DOLIM: It appears the primate was useful after all. Take her back to
her cell. Initiate the pre-arming protocols. Inform me when the weapon
is ready for launch.
 Captain's starlog, February 13th, 2154. We're
preparing to enter a Xindi vortex, thanks to some help from the
aquatics. If everything goes as planned, we'll intercept the weapon in
less than two hours. Enterprise may be coming apart at the seams, but I
can't say the same for the crew. After nearly eight months in the
Expanse they're ready to do what they came to do. No matter what it
takes, no matter what the cost.
(An enormous Aquatic ship is at the centre of the flotilla.)
 [Armoury]
 REED: Have you assembled your boarding party?
HAYES: Ready to deploy on your command.
REED: I wish I was leading it myself.
HAYES: Your place is on the Bridge, sir.
REED: No offence, Major. It's just that Ensign Sato is a friend. Here's
my report on Corporal Hawkins.
HAYES: Thank you. Would you like to go over my rescue plan?
REED: First, I'd like to know if we have a problem.
HAYES: Sir?
REED: If you blame me for the Corporal's death.
HAYES: Permission to speak freely? I've never liked putting my people
under someone else's command. You're senior Tactical Officer, but
they're my team. I can't help but think that if I'd been there things
might have turned out differently.
REED: I did everything I could. Things happened very fast.
HAYES: I understand.
REED: I'm not finished. Hawkins may well have been a MACO, but he was
my responsibility out there.
HAYES: When we first came aboard Enterprise, we definitely felt like
outsiders.
REED: If I contributed to that, I apologise.
HAYES: My point is, none of us feel that way anymore. We're all part of
the same crew, no matter which uniform we wear. Don't worry about
Ensign Sato. We'll bring her home.
 [Captain's Mess]
 (Porthos is watching his master hoping for scraps.
Of course, he gets some.)
TUCKER: I'd almost forgotten what Chef can do with a steak. I hope the
crew forgives me for not patching up the Galley sooner.
T'POL: I've heard no complaints, except from Chef of course.
TUCKER: When this is all over, I plan on having a little chat with the
Starfleet Quartermaster about what they put in those ration packs.
ARCHER: When this is all over, I won't be complaining about the food.
I'll just be happy to get back to our original mission.
TUCKER: Hope you plan on swinging by Earth first. I told the
Engineering team I'd buy them a few rounds at the 602 club. You're both
invited, of course.
ARCHER: I wouldn't miss it.
TUCKER: What about you?
T'POL: You may buy me a drink if you wish.
TUCKER: I meant, what are your plans for the future? It's been a long
time since you've been to Vulcan.
ARCHER: The High Command would be lucky to get you back.
T'POL: There are some colleagues I'd enjoy seeing again, but I've
considered formalising my service with Starfleet.
ARCHER: I may be able to pull some strings, get you out of basic
training.
TUCKER: Can you imagine the look of Soval's face when he sees her in a
Starfleet uniform? Please let me be there.
T'POL: I said I was considering it.
REED [OC]: Bridge to the Captain.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
REED [OC]: We're approaching the co-ordinates.
ARCHER: Tactical Alert. I'm on my way.
 [Weapon control area]
 LIEUTENANT: Activate the reactor.
TECHNICIAN: Yes, Lieutenant.
LIEUTENANT: Commander Dolim,
 [Reptilian Brig]
 LIEUTENANT [OC]: The final arming sequence has
begun.
DOLIM: Excellent. Inform me when you are ready. I'll be in my thermal
chamber.
(An alarm sounds.)
DOLIM: What is it?
SOLDIER: A vortex is opening.
DOLIM: Where?
SOLDIER: Bearing two seven nine, range four thousand kilometres. Were
you expecting reinforcements?
DOLIM: No.
(Three ships appear.)
SOLDIER: Arboreals.
DOLIM: Send a patrol to intercept them.
SOLDIER: More vortexes are opening. Fourteen, eighteen ships. Aquatics.
Six ships approaching the weapon.
DOLIM: Target them. Have Commander Kolo's squadron maintain position.
 [Bridge]
 REED: They're moving to intercept, but they're
keeping a substantial force around the weapon.
ARCHER: Feel like taking them on?
REED: Give me the word, sir.
ARCHER: This is Captain Archer. Cut us loose.
(Enterprise flies out of the Aquatic ship's shuttlebay.)
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 SOLDIER: Sir. The humans.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Steady, Travis.
(Enterprise heads for the weapon.)
 [Degra's ship]
 JANNAR: They're breaking off.
HUMANOID: Have all ships concentrate their fire on the weapon.
 [Bridge]
 REED: We're in range.
ARCHER: Fire.
(Enterprise strafes the weapon.)
 [Weapon Control area]
 TECHNICIAN: They're targeting the primary
generators.
LIEUTENANT: Continue the arming sequence.
 [Bridge]
 REED: Minor damage to the starboard nacelle. We're
still in the fight.
ARCHER: Bring us around for another pass.
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 (Things are going bang.)
DOLIM: Target the Earth vessel.
SOLDIER: We can't, sir. The Aquatics are protecting them.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Captain, I've located Ensign Sato. She's on
board one of the Reptilian vessels.
ARCHER: Can you get a transporter lock?
T'POL: She's somewhere on the first three decks. I can't pinpoint her
exact location.
ARCHER: Send Major Hayes and his team.
REED: Aye, sir.
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 (As the four MACOs beam on board and start
searching.)
SOLDIER: We've lost eight vessels. We've only disabled two of theirs.
We're no match for the Aquatics.
DOLIM: Lieutenant.
 [Weapon Control area]
 DOLIM [OC]: We must deploy the weapon now.
LIEUTENANT: We need another five minutes.
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 DOLIM: In another five minutes it will be
destroyed
 [Weapon Control area]
 DOLIM [OC]: And you along with it.
 [Hoshi's cell]
 (The MACO's take out a guard then blow the door
open. Hoshi is lying on the floor, unconscious.)
HAYES: Ensign. Ensign! Hayes to Enterprise. Enterprise, respond. We
should get back to the beam-in point.
(He hauls Hoshi over his shoulder easily.)
 [Trans-dimensional space]
 PRIMARY: The Reptilians are under attack.
BUILDER: If we don't act, the weapon will be destroyed.
PRESAGE: The timelines now indicate that is the likely outcome.
PRIMARY: Proceed.
(A Sphere starts to light up along its seams and throw off energy
waves.)
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Captain, there's a massive anomaly forming
near the weapon. Two more.
(The bulkheads ripple.)
ARCHER: Keep us clear of them, Travis.
TRAVIS: We'll have to pull back.
ARCHER: Do what you can, but keep us in firing range.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
(An Aquatic ship gets mangled by the transformed space)
 [Degra's ship]
 HUMANOID: Captain Archer.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
HUMANOID: The anomalies are creating a barrier between us and the
weapon.
 [Bridge]
 HUMANOID [OC]: We can't get through.
 [Reptilian ship]
 HAYES: (under fire) Hayes to Enterprise.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Go ahead.
HAYES [OC]: We've got Sato.
ARCHER: Archer to Tucker. Lock onto Major Hayes.
 [Transporter alcove]
 TUCKER: I wish I could, sir. The last anomaly
knocked the transporter offline. Tell them to stand by.
 [Bridge]
 ARCHER: Archer to Hayes. We've got a malfunction.
Can you hold your position?
 [Reptilian ship]
 HAYES: Affirmative.
(He uses a grenade to take out the Reptilians behind them, then carries
on shooting at the ones in front.)
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 SOLDIER: The intruders are trapped on level seven.
DOLIM: And the anomalies?
SOLDIER: They've disabled three of the Aquatic ships.
DOLIM: The Guardians will not let us fail.
 [Transporter alcove]
 TUCKER: Tucker to Hayes.
HAYES [OC]: Go ahead.
TUCKER: I'm ready to get you out, but I can only transport two
 [Reptilian ship]
 TUCKER [OC]: At a time. I'm going to have to reset
the buffer.
HAYES: Take her. Lock on Kelly and Sato.
(They get beamed out.)
TUCKER [OC]: Ready for two more.
HAYES: You two are next.
(After Kemper, who has just been hit, and the
other are safe.)
HAYES: I could use a change of scenery.
TUCKER [OC]: Stand by, Major.
(He beams him out just as a Reptilian gets two clean shots
in. Hayes arrives on the transporter pad and collapses
straight away from his wounds.)
 [Weapon Control area]
 LIEUTENANT: Commander Dolim.
DOLIM [OC]: What's your status?
LIEUTENANT: We've completed the arming sequence.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Captain. The power readings from the weapon
are increasing.
REED: They're preparing to launch.
ARCHER: Get us close, Travis.
TRAVIS: What about the anomalies?
ARCHER: I said, take us in.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
 [Weapon Control area]
 LIEUTENANT: Ready to launch on your order,
Commander.
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 DOLIM: Open a vortex. Set a course for Earth.
(The big, round nasty disappears from sight.)
 [Bridge]
 REED: They're gone.
 [Sickbay]
 (A very crowded place with lots of filled beds.)
REED: Doctor?
HAYES: I told him I was ready for duty.
REED: I'm afraid he's a bit of a mother hen.
HAYES: How's Ensign Sato?
PHLOX: Her biosigns are stable.
REED: Thank you for bringing her home.
HAYES: All in a days work. Use McKenzie.
REED: What?
HAYES: She knows the team. Rely on her.
REED: No more of that talk. That's an order.
(Hayes jerks and has a heart attack)
PHLOX: Cardio-stimulator. Step away, please.
(He applies the paddles to Hayes' chest.)
PHLOX: Increase by point two joules.
(But it's no good. The gallant Major has gone.)
 [Situation room]
 ARCHER: How long before it reaches Earth?
JANNAR: Ten hours.
ARCHER: Could an aquatic ship reach it in time?
HUMANOID: Doubtful. They have powerful weapons but their speed is
limited.
JANNAR: Degra's ship is considerably faster.
TUCKER: What are we waiting for?
HUMANOID: The ship isn't well-armed. It would be useless against the
weapon.
ARCHER: We might be able to get a team on board, disable it from the
inside.
JANNAR: The Reptilians will have soldiers stationed aboard the weapon.
ARCHER: We'll deal with them when we get there.
HUMANOID: Captain, the Aquatics joined us only because you promised to
neutralise the Spheres. They expect you to fulfil that promise.
JANNAR: The future of our people is at stake, as well.
ARCHER: Are you ready?
T'POL: I believe so. We have a plan to disable Sphere Forty One.
TUCKER: If we're right, it should disrupt the entire network.
ARCHER: Then as soon as we undock, set a course for Sphere Forty One.
 [Armoury]
 REED: (to all the MACOs) At ease. I've just come
from Sickbay, where the Doctor assures me that Sergeant Kemper and
Ensign Sato will make full recoveries. Unfortunately, Major Hayes'
injuries were more severe. He didn't survive. I'm sorry. We've got less
than ten hours before this weapon reaches Earth. The Captain wants to
take a team aboard to destroy it. I don't imagine the reptilians will
make this easy for us, but that's why you're here. That's why Major
Hayes picked each one of you for this mission. Because he knew you'd
get the job done. I need three volunteers. (all step forward) Woods,
Ramira, Forbes. Assemble your gear. Meet me at the starboard airlock in
ten minutes.
 [Sickbay]
 ARCHER: How is she?
PHLOX: Stable. The Xindi parasites were no match for my osmotic eel.
ARCHER: I need to talk to her.
PHLOX: She's undergone a severe neural trauma.
ARCHER: She's been inside the weapon. I have to know what she saw.
PHLOX: It should be safe to revive her in two hours. No less.
ARCHER: All right. Have her taken aboard Degra's ship right away.
PHLOX: She's in no condition to be moved!
ARCHER: I don't have any choice, Doctor.
PHLOX: You could kill her.
ARCHER: I want her on that ship in twenty minutes.
PHLOX: She'll need another cortical treatment. At least let me come
with you.
ARCHER: There's a medical bay aboard Degra's ship. Show Lieutenant Reed
how to do it.
PHLOX: He's not a doctor.
ARCHER: Phlox, you're needed here.
(Archer walks away down a corridor lined with injured crewmen.)
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 SOLDIER: The Insectoids.
INSECTOID [on viewscreen]: The anomalies worked to our advantage.
DOLIM: We were fortunate.
INSECTOID [on viewscreen]: It was more than good fortune. The human
claims the Guardians control the Spheres.
DOLIM: He also started a civil war between our species.
INSECTOID [on viewscreen]: The human didn't kill Degra. You did.
DOLIM: Degra was a traitor.
INSECTOID [on viewscreen]: I'm no longer certain of that.
DOLIM: Then it's a good thing we already have your launch codes.
(ends communication)
DOLIM: Lock weapons on their ship.
SOLDIER: Sir?
DOLIM: I won't risk any more interference. Fire.
(The little ship is hit, and smashes against the weapon.)
 [Airlock]
 (Degra's ship is docked, and two MACOs carry Hoshi
on a stretcher.)
TUCKER: Malcolm. Hang on. Bring me back a piece of that weapon. A
souvenir.
REED: With pleasure. All set, sir.
ARCHER: When we're finished, we'll meet you at the rendezvous
coordinates.
TUCKER: We'll be there. Captain, good luck.
ARCHER: I expect you to keep him in line.
T'POL: I'll do my best.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Zero Hour
Zero Hour
 Mission date: Feb 14, 2154
Original Airdate: 26 May, 2004
  T'POL
[OC]: Previously on Enterprise
 T'POL [Bridge]: I've
located Ensign Sato. She's on board one of the Reptilian vessels.
DOLIM [Weapon control area]: The
third launch code.
LIEUTENANT: We have complete access.
DOLIM [Reptilian Bridge]: The
Guardians will not let us fail.
T'POL [Bridge]: The
power readings from the weapon are increasing.
REED: They're preparing to launch.
DOLIM [Reptilian Bridge]: Open a
vortex. Set a course for Earth.
REED [Armoury]: The
Captain wants to take a team aboard to destroy it. I need three
volunteers.
PHLOX [Sickbay]: She's
undergone a severe neural trauma.
ARCHER: She's been inside the weapon. I have to know what she saw. Have
her taken aboard Degra's ship right away.
HUMANOID [Situation room]: The
Aquatics joined us only because you promised to neutralise the Spheres.
T'POL: We have a plan to disable Sphere Forty One.
TUCKER: If we're right, it should disrupt the entire network.
BUILDER [Reptilian Bridge]:
Reptilians will preside over a stronger, unified Xindi empire, if
humankind is eradicated.
 [Reptilian mess hall]
 DOLIM: If they had made us the dominant species
before the wars our homeworld would still exist.
SOLDIER: And our avian brothers would still fill the skies.
DOLIM: We should be grateful that the Guardians have finally come to
their senses. Once Earth is destroyed, the reptilians will take their
rightful place at the head of a new Xindi empire.
(Each eats a live mouse)
 [Degra's ship]
 HUMANOID: They're nearly three hours ahead of us,
but this vessel is faster. We're closing the gap.
REED: It may be faster but it's not well-armed. How many ships are
escorting the weapon?
HUMANOID: I can't tell.
ARCHER: The only way we're going to be able to destroy this thing is
from the inside. Any luck?
JANNAR: All of Degra's schematics are encrypted.
ARCHER: We're going to need Hoshi to help us.
REED: She's in no condition to come up here.
ARCHER: I wish I had a choice, Malcolm.
REED: Sir, she's barely conscious.
ARCHER: Can you transfer that to a PADD? Something portable?
 [Transdimensional space]
 PRESAGE: The favourable timelines continue to
diminish.
BUILDER: They should be increasing. The weapon has almost reached it's
target.
PRIMARY: But the Earth ship is on course for our primary Sphere.
Accelerate the transformation around that Sphere. They mustn't be
allowed to intervene.
 [Engineering]
 T'POL: Report.
TUCKER: We've realigned the main power grid. It should increase the
deflector pulse threefold, maybe four, but it's going to fry just about
every system on board.
T'POL: Be prepared to initiate the pulse within two hours.
TUCKER: I don't think you heard what I just said. We try this and the
ship's going to come apart at the seams.
T'POL: Two hours, Mister Tucker.
TUCKER: The Captain told the Xindi we'd try to knock these things out.
He didn't say anything about demolishing Enterprise in the process.
T'POL: Has it occurred to you what's going to happen if Captain Archer
fails? If Earth is destroyed?
TUCKER: Every day.
T'POL: Good. Then you've already come to the conclusion that without
humanity there's no one to combat these Sphere Builders. Their Expanse
will continue to grow, encompassing one system after another, including
Vulcan. Your world is no longer the only one in jeopardy. Two hours.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: I think we've got a problem.
T'POL: What is it?
TRAVIS: Sphere Forty One.
T'POL: Are you certain these are the coordinates?
TRAVIS: Yep. There shouldn't be anything on sensors, not with the
cloaking barrier, but there it is and it's getting bigger.
T'POL: Have you analysed it?
TRAVIS: Could be spatial anomalies, but they're clustered much tighter
than we've ever seen them.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: They're transforming the space around that
Sphere. Not unlike the disturbance where we found that
trans-dimensional being. They obviously expected us.
T'POL: If we're going to disable the network we'll need to get within a
kilometre of the surface.
PHLOX: If the ship were to enter that disturbance, the entire crew
would be dead within minutes. I could synthesise a neuraleptic compound
that would keep us conscious for approximately twelve minutes. I'm
afraid there's nothing I can do to prevent epidermal decay.
T'POL: Twelve minutes won't be enough.
PHLOX: Perhaps I can extend it, but not by much. I encourage you and
Mister Tucker to encourage alternatives. There must be something you
can do to abbreviate your plan.
 [Degra's ship - Hoshi's room]
 ARCHER: Any luck? Ensign?
HOSHI: I'm not feeling very well. Do you think you can get Phlox to
come down here?
ARCHER: We're on Degra's ship, Hoshi. Phlox isn't here.
HOSHI: I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing.
ARCHER: The schematics for the weapon. Degra encrypted them before he
was killed. You've been trying to decipher them.
HOSHI: I gave them the third code. They wouldn't have been able to arm
the weapon if I hadn't given them the third code.
ARCHER: You were drugged, Hoshi. You had no choice.
HOSHI: I did. I should have fought harder.
ARCHER: You need to finish what you're doing. You're almost there.
We're going to board the weapon, try to overload the power systems, but
we can't do that until we can read these schematics.
HOSHI: I tried to jump but I wasn't fast enough.
ARCHER: You need to finish this.
HOSHI: You've got the three codes so why don't you just kill me? Didn't
you say you're going to kill me?
ARCHER: You've got to pull yourself together just for a little while
longer. You need to complete the decryption. Everything hinges on it.
Do you understand?
HOSHI: I understand.
 [Weapon control platform]
 DOLIM: When we exit the vortex, how close will we
be?
LIEUTENANT: Approximately two million kilometres from Earth.
DOLIM: Two million!
LIEUTENANT: If we had all five codes we could begin the firing sequence
immediately, but with three we'll need additional time. We'd be
vulnerable if we dropped into normal space any closer to the target.
DOLIM: Do what ever it takes to fire the weapon as quickly as possible.
 [Engineering]
 TRAVIS: You wanted to see me, sir?
TUCKER: I think I've found a way to boost the deflector pulse without
tearing the ship apart, but it's going to mean transferring all impulse
power to the array.
TRAVIS: When?
TUCKER: As soon as we reach the Sphere.
TRAVIS: Sir.
TUCKER: Sorry, Travis. You're going to have to get us to the manifold
on thrusters only.
TRAVIS: That's tying my hands, Commander, especially with the ticking
clock.
TUCKER: You can do it. Look over these schematics, familiarise yourself
with the features of the Sphere.
 [Degra's ship]
 REED: We won't be able to transport directly onto
the control platform, it's too heavily shielded. We'll have to beam in
and out no deeper than this peripheral framework.
HUMANOID: What if you need to board the weapon before your crewman
completes her decryptions?
ARCHER: I'm taking her with me.
REED: Sir, she's hardly in any shape
ARCHER: She's been there, Malcolm. That's where she deciphered that
third launch code.
REED: She was drugged. There's no reason to believe that she'll
remember anything.
ARCHER: She's coming with me. I want you and your team to beam in right
before we do. Secure the closest route to the platform.
JANNAR If you succeed in creating the overload, what makes you think
you'll be able to get out in time?
ARCHER: I'll give everyone a chance to get to the outer framework.
You'll be in charge of helping Hoshi.
REED: And you, sir?
ARCHER: I've no plans of dying on that weapon, Malcolm. I'm going to
see what else she's come up with.
 [Balcony]
 (Archer has walked out into sunlight and is
looking down on a huge circular stage.)
DANIELS: This is a very important day, Jonathan.
ARCHER: I don't have time for this.
DANIELS: It'll only take a minute. You see the fellow in the blue
jacket, near the left hand of the dais? That's you, a little more than
seven years from now. You and the others are about to make history. Do
you remember I told you about a Federation?
ARCHER: What about it?
DANIELS: I work with some people who are going to be pretty angry with
me for telling you this, but you're going to be an integral part of
forming that Federation. You're down there, right now, with Vulcans,
Andorians and Tellarites, getting ready to sign the Charter. The
membership is going to grow. Dozen, eventually hundreds of species. A
United Federation of Planets.
ARCHER: I have a team preparing to board the weapon. I've got other
things to think about right now.
DANIELS: Let Reed or one of the others go to the control platform.
ARCHER: What are you talking about?
DANIELS: It's too great a risk. If you're killed, none of this will
happen. At least, not the way it's supposed to happen.
ARCHER: Then it'll happen some other way. Who's to say whether it'll be
better or worse?
DANIELS: It's essential you be a part of this.
ARCHER: Where are we? What planet?
DANIELS: Earth.
ARCHER: Seems to me it's just as essential that Earth be around for
this too.
DANIELS: Lieutenant Reed can work with Sato. (applause in background)
They are not crucial to the future of mankind. You are.
ARCHER: My mission is to save Earth, not your Federation.
DANIELS: You can't ignore your place in history.
ARCHER: My place is on that control platform. Now get me the hell back
to Degra's ship.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: (dictating a letter) And if it's not too
much of an inconvenience, I'd appreciate it if you'd contact my first
wife's third husband, Groznik. Tell him that he's welcome to keep the
Aldebaran drum set I loaned him. Oh, they have a child named Indaura, a
sweet little girl, she must be eight or nine by now. Well, I would like
to leave her my botanical library. She always had a flair for plants.
Computer, pause recording. Everything's ready here.
T'POL: Commander Tucker has completed his modifications to the
deflector. I apologise if I interrupted you.
(Phlox hands over a cylinder.)
PHLOX: Oh no, don't be silly. I was simply dictating a letter to my
colleague, Doctor Lucas. He offered to make sure my affairs were in
order in the event that, er, well, you know.
T'POL: I have always found it distracting to think of death, especially
when entering a dangerous situation.
PHLOX: Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. I don't know about
Vulcans, but Denobulans take great pleasure in bequeathing their
belongings to far-flung relatives.
T'POL: We're not dead yet.
TRAVIS [OC]: Bridge to T'Pol.
T'POL: Go ahead.
TRAVIS [OC]: We're approaching the co-ordinates.
T'POL: Take us out of warp. Hope for the best, Doctor.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: It's grown. It's a hundred thousand
kilometres deeper than when we first detected it.
PHLOX: (at Reed's station) I've enhanced the neuraleptic compound as
much as I can. I strongly advise we remain in the disturbance no longer
than fifteen minutes.
T'POL: Are you ready to release the compound? Then proceed. Stand by to
charge the deflector. Set a course, Ensign.
 Captain's starlog, supplemental. We've begun to
formulate a plan, thanks to Hoshi, who's made some progress in
decrypting the schematics.
 [Degra's ship - Hoshi's room]
 HOSHI: What have you guys figured out?
ARCHER: We've got to disable the reactor at a specific point during the
inversion sequence, but we don't know the sequence. If it's not done in
the right order, internal safeguards will kick in and it'll be
impossible to create an overload.
HOSHI: I've found the sequence, but decrypting it's another story. Your
friend Degra didn't make this easy.
ARCHER: I wish I could tell you to take your time.
HOSHI: The first time you came to visit me in Brazil.
ARCHER: It didn't stop raining for a week.
HOSHI: I had a bug then, too. A tropical bacterium not a reptilian
parasite. I was sick as a dog but I wanted to make a good impression.
ARCHER: When we get back home I'll see to it you get some R+R in Norway
or Canada. Someplace where there's not a tropical bug in sight.
HOSHI: Or reptiles.
ARCHER: Or reptiles. Keep at it. I'll get these to the Bridge.
 [Degra's ship - Bridge]
 JANNAR: We've gotten close enough to isolate their
signatures.
HUMANOID: The Insectoid ship is no longer with them.
ARCHER: Why would they leave the vortex?
JANNAR: We have no idea. All we know is that the weapon is being
escorted by a single Reptilian vessel. Dolim's.
REED: At least we'll only have one ship to contend with.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: Here we go.
(Enterprise enters the brown gloop.)
T'POL: Doctor?
PHLOX: Fifteen minutes and counting.
T'POL: Any sign of the Sphere?
TRAVIS: It's too soon.
T'POL: Hold your course.
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 SOLDIER: Degra's vessel is less than twenty
minutes behind us.
DOLIM: Lieutenant, we're about to drop into normal space.
 [Weapon control platform]
 DOLIM [OC]: Stand by to initiate the firing
sequence.
LIEUTENANT: We're ready.
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 DOLIM: Are you detecting any Earth vessels near
the co-ordinates?
SOLDIER: No vessels, but there is one small orbital station. Unarmed.
(They emerge into normal space.)
DOLIM: Let me see Earth.
(A little blue-white dot in the middle of the viewscreen.)
DOLIM: Enlarge. It's a shame. All that water. The Aquatics would feel
at home here.
 [Bridge]
 TRAVIS: I've got it.
T'POL: How far?
TRAVIS: Twenty thousand kilometres.
PHLOX: Thirteen minutes left.
T'POL: As soon as we make visual contact, go to thrusters. Set a
heading to latitude fifteen degrees north. Deflector?
TUCKER: (at T'Pol's station) Standing by.
(He sees the back of his hand looking dry and cracked.)
 [Degra's ship]
 (In normal space)
JANNAR: They're eight hundred thousand kilometres ahead.
ARCHER: Get your team ready to go.
REED: Aye sir.
HUMANOID: Dolim's changing course. They're heading for a space station.
ARCHER: Are we in visual range? (image on viewscreen) Yosemite Three.
JANNAR: A military installation?
ARCHER: A research post. Usually thirty to forty civilians aboard. Hail
them on this frequency.
HUMANOID: The weapon's emitting disruption waves. I can't get anything
through.
 [Bridge]
 (Sphere forty one looms into view through the
thick 'fog'.)
TRAVIS: Fifteen degrees north.
T'POL: Drop to two thousand metres. Track starboard, eighty two mark
zero.
TRAVIS: Aye.
TUCKER: Doc, there's something weird happening to my skin.
TRAVIS: Me too.
PHLOX: It was expected. Try not to scratch it. Eleven minutes
remaining.
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 DOLIM: The Guardian said that once Earth is gone
we're to destroy all human colonies. I see no reason not to begin with
this station. Target. Fire when ready.
(They fire two shots. There's a series of secondary explosions and the
little station falls apart in a ball of fire.)
 [Degra's ship]
 [Witnessing the callous act of terrorism.)
JANNAR: They're heading back towards the weapon.
 [Bridge]
 T'POL: Ten degrees port. Slow to thirty kph. I'm
transferring the target point to the deflector array.
TUCKER: Got it.
T'POL: Begin.
(The ship shakes.)
TUCKER: Fish in a barrel.
PHLOX: Less than ten minutes to go.
(three Sphere Builders appear in Engineering. They knock out the crew
with energy balls and start sticking their hands into machinery to
disrupt systems)
TUCKER: What the hell's going on? Power just fell ten percent.
TRAVIS: I'm picking up explosions on E deck.
T'POL: Bridge to Engineering. Report.
TUCKER: I'm losing the beam.
PHLOX: There are nine alien lifesigns aboard. They appear to be
transdimensional beings.
TRAVIS: How's that possible?
PHLOX: This disturbance we're in, it's obviously been altered enough to
sustain them.
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 DOLIM: Who's on Degra's ship?
SOLDIER: Eight primates, three arboreals and seven humans.
DOLIM: Have their weapons been upgraded?
SOLDIER: No, sir.
DOLIM: Pathetic. Prepare to intercept.
 [Degra's ship]
 JANNAR: They're arming their torpedoes.
REED: Sir.
ARCHER: How's Hoshi doing?
REED: She's holding up. She and the MACO's are at the transporter
device.
ARCHER: (to the two Xindi) Remember, no heroics. Just get us in and
then keep them off your ass.
JANNAR: There's another vessel approaching at high warp. They're asking
for you.
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: You're not using your head, pinkskin. That ship
you're on is no match for the reptilian.
ARCHER: I'm busy, Shran. What are you doing here?
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: You should be impressed we managed to track you
through the vortex. I anticipated that you'd need some help.
 [Bridge]
 (In a corridor, a Builder bowls over a security
team with a single energy ball.)
KELLY [OC]: Corporal Kelly to the Bridge.
T'POL: Go ahead.
KELLY [OC]: Our weapons are passing right through them.
TUCKER: You've got to stop this. If I don't get full power back this is
going to take three, four minutes longer than we've got.
PHLOX: We can't afford three or four minutes. Corporal Kelly, listen to
me very closely. Modulate your weapons to a rotating frequency of
thirty two point six teracycles.
T'POL: Doctor.
PHLOX: Our transdimensional friend, the one we found in the pod, I had
quite a few hours to study his physiology. Let's hope my memory serves
me well.
 [Shran's Bridge]
 SHRAN: I'll be right in front of you, gentlemen.
 [Degra's ship]
 SHRAN [OC]: Keep a low profile.
HUMANOID: We're matching speed.
 [Reptilian ship]
 DOLIM: You said there were no human vessels in the
vicinity.
SOLDIER: They're not human.
DOLIM: Destroy them both.
 [Shran's Bridge]
 (Taking hits from the Reptilian weapons.)
SHRAN: That third torpedo almost got you. Be careful! Prepare to come
about to port.
 [Degra's ship]
 SHRAN [OC]: Stay below me.
HUMANOID: We'll need to get within a kilometre of the weapon.
SHRAN [OC]: Just stay below me.
 [Shran's Bridge]
 SHRAN: Let's fight back this time, shall we. Bring
the forward cannons online.
(the two large ships exchange fire)
 [Degra's ship]
 SHRAN [OC]: Go!
 [Shran's Bridge]
 SHRAN: And tell Archer we're not even any more. He
owes me!
(In the Weapon control area, Dolim's Lieutenant looks up to
see Archer and Hoshi on the opposite side of the control panel. Reed
and the MACOs shoot him and his assistants before they can draw their
weapons.)
 [Bridge]
 TUCKER: It's coming back. Tell them to keep doing
what they're doing.
(The aliens escape the weapons fire by walking through bulkheads.)
WALKER [OC]: Walker to the Bridge.
T'POL: Go ahead.
WALKER [OC]: We've secured Engineering but I don't think we've seen the
last of them.
PHLOX: It's time for you to work your magic, Mister Tucker. Within five
minutes, everyone on this ship is going to start dying.
TUCKER: No pressure.
 [Weapon Control platform]
 (There is a row of vertical lighted tubes in the
floor, glowing green, looking like a balustrade.)
ARCHER: Okay, bring up the inversion sequence.
HOSHI: Start with the third one from the left.
(He takes a big lighted rod and turns it upside down. Now it glows
red.)
ARCHER: Got it.
HOSHI: The second from the right.
(As he completes that one, there is weapons fire.)
ARCHER: Hoshi?
HOSHI: I'm all right. The first one on the left is next.
 [Reptilian Bridge]
 SOLDIER: Commander, sensors show the humans are no
longer aboard Degra's vessel.
DOLIM: These ships are drawing us away from the weapon. Get us back!
 [Bridge]
 (The Builders start disrupting any system they can
put their hands into.)
TUCKER: What's going on?
PHLOX: Ignore it Commander. You've got less than two minutes.
 [Weapon Control platform]
 ARCHER: Got it. Two to go.
(Reptilian soldiers march along the access gantry, firing. The young
MACO sniper takes them out with one falling into the centre of the
weapon, then gets caught by a Reptilian. There's a brief hand to hand
struggle before he is stabbed and falls into the middle of the weapon
himself. The Reptilian shoots at Hoshi and she drops her PADD into the
void.)
ARCHER: Hoshi?
(Archer leaves the rods to defend her. Reed
kicks the Reptilian coming up on Archer into the void as well.)
REED: (into communicator) Reed to Archer.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
REED: I'm pretty sure that was the last one, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: Good work. Now get back here.
 [Bridge]
 (Everybody has nasty cracks all over their skin.)
PHLOX: T'Pol. T'Pol!
T'POL: All right. Take us to full impulse. Get us out of here.
TUCKER: Wait a minute, I'm almost there.
PHLOX: You don't have a minute, Commander!
TUCKER: Give me ten seconds. I'm telling you I've got it.
(The aliens are still creating havoc.)
PHLOX: That's it, times up.
TUCKER: It sure is.
(He hits a button and the Sphere gently crumples.)
T'POL: Now, Mister Mayweather.
(As the Sphere implodes, an energy beam streaks to another Sphere,
destroying it as well and causing it to send out another beam. The
aliens jerk upright in pain and vanish. Ships systems are restored.)
T'POL: The network is being destroyed.
MAYWEATHER: Looks like we're getting out of this soup faster than we
thought.
PHLOX: Without the Spheres, their transformed space must be collapsing
in on itself.
 [Weapon Control platform]
 ARCHER: Which one, Hoshi?
HOSHI: Number four. The fourth one from the left.
REED: Are you sure?
HOSHI: Yes, yes. Number five is the last one after you disable the
reactor.
(Archer reverses the rod.)
REED: But if we knock the reactor out, won't that be enough?
ARCHER: We didn't come here to disable this weapon, we're here to
destroy it. Give me the charges.
REED: I'll take care of it, sir.
ARCHER: I want the four of you to get to the outer framework. Beam back
to Degra's ship.
REED: As Chief Tactical Officer, sir
ARCHER: This isn't open for debate, Lieutenant.
(Reed hands over the
charges and detonator, and leaves with Hoshi and the MACO. As Hoshi
turns to look at him, he says)
ARCHER: Don't worry, I'll be right behind you.
(He sticks the charges on the twirly gizmo and detonates them. It stops
twirling and goes dark. He turns the final rod upside down and a klaxon
sounds. Then he gets grabbed.)
DOLIM: What have you done!
(They fight. The Reptilian is much stronger, and almost throws him to
his death, but he grabs a rail in time. Explosions shake the weapon and
Dolim looses his footing as Archer clambers back up and starts kicking
him in the face. Dolim soon fights back, throwing Archer against a
stanchion.)
 [Shran's Bridge]
 CREWMAN: One Reptilian transported to the weapon.
SHRAN: Let's make sure he has nowhere to go back to. They have no
shielding on their starboard engines. Target all weapons.
(Two shots and the Reptilian ship flies apart.)
 [Degra's ship]
 REED: Can you get a lock on him?
HUMANOID: Not yet.
JANNAR: Your Captain is too deep within the weapon.
(Flames rise from the middle of the weapon as Dolim dangles Archer over
it. Archer manages to put a spare explosive charge on the Reptilian's
back and get away from him. Then he smugly detonates it. Splat.
Silhouetted by fire he runs along a gantry to the outer framework. The
weapon explodes above Earth's atmosphere.)
 T'POL [OC]: Acting Captain's starlog, February
14th, 2152. We're holding position at the coordinates where we were
told to meet Degra's vessel. So far there's been no word from them.
 [Command centre]
(T'Pol looks at the main display monitor.)
 T'POL: Long range sensors are detecting no
evidence of the Spheres.
TUCKER: None of them?
T'POL: None. And all the spatial anomalies within our scanning range
have vanished.
TUCKER: What about the thermobaric cloud barrier?
T'POL: I can only detect a small section from our location, but it
appears to be dissipating.
TUCKER: Looks like we kept our end of the bargain.
T'POL: It would appear that the Expanse is returning to normal space.
TUCKER: We should have heard something by now. What if they failed?
Earth could be
T'POL: Be patient.
(She puts her hand on his shoulder and he sees the
back of her hand.)
TUCKER: My skin's healing faster than yours. I guess you Vulcans aren't
so tough after all.
T'POL: Doctor Phlox says we should all be back to normal within two to
three days.
TUCKER: I'm only kidding. You look nice like this. Kind of like an old
oil painting.
T'POL: I'm not old. I will only be sixty six years old on my next
birthday.
TUCKER: I can't believe you told me that.
T'POL: You accused me of looking old.
TUCKER: That's not what I mean. I've been trying to get you to tell me
your age since we left Spacedock. Why now?
T'POL: To Vulcans, certain information is considered intimate.
TUCKER: Intimate?
TRAVIS [OC]: Bridge to T'Pol.
T'POL: Go ahead.
TRAVIS [OC]: A vortex just opened. It's Degra's ship.
 [Bridge]
 (Tucker is at Hoshi's station as garbled crackles
come over the speakers.)
T'POL: This is Enterprise. Please repeat.
TUCKER: Captain, did you stop the weapon? (unintelligible static)
Captain?
T'POL: Set an intercept course.
 [Airlock]
 (Degra's ship is docked with Enterprise.)
REED: It's done.
T'POL: Done?
REED: Captain Archer destroyed the weapon.
(Tucker watches the rest of the team come back on board.)
TUCKER: Where is he? Is he okay?
REED: Captain didn't make it, Trip.
TUCKER: What do you mean, he didn't make it.
REED: The weapon exploded before he could transport to Degra's ship.
(Hoshi hugs Tucker, and T'Pol looks ready to cry.)
 [Ready room]
 (As Enterprise is taken back into the Aquatic
ship's shuttlebay.)
T'POL: Come in. (to crewman) Thank you.
HUMANOID: The Aquatic vessel should have you home in less than a day.
T'POL: I was pleased to hear that the Council has agreed to reconvene,
HUMANOID: It was difficult for the Insectoids to ignore recent events.
T'POL: And the Reptilians?
HUMANOID: They'll join us eventually. They have no choice but to accept
that the Guardians' promises were empty. Your Captain's sacrifice will
not be forgotten. Safe journey.
T'POL: Thank you.
 [Sickbay]
 PHLOX: (to his agitated pets) It's all right. All
right, it won't be much longer. I promise.
T'POL: Is something wrong?
PHLOX: I think they sense that we're travelling in an unusual manner.
In the belly of the beast, so to speak.
T'POL: There are no windows here. How would they know we're inside the
Aquatic vessel?
PHLOX: I don't have the slightest idea. I doubt I'll get much peace and
quiet around here until we're flying under our own power.
T'POL: It will only be a few more hours.
PHLOX: Is there something I can do for you?
T'POL: (rolling up her sleeve) My skin hasn't fully healed yet.
PHLOX: Oh, you're doing fine. Vulcan's are obviously more sensitive to
the effects of mysterious realms.
T'POL: I guess we're not so tough after all.
PHLOX: Excuse me?
T'POL: Is there anything I'll need to treat this?
PHLOX: Only time. How's morale?
T'POL: It isn't easy for a crew to lose it's Captain.
PHLOX: I suppose we'll all need time to heal.
T'POL: Will he be all right?
(Porthos is lying on his dog cushion looking dejected, with and
untouched bowl of food by the side.)
PHLOX: After a while. He's lost his best friend, but it's just a matter
of time. He'll be fine again.
T'POL: Did you hear that? The Doctor say's you'll be fine. It's just a
matter of time.
(She gently strokes Porthos' head)
 [Bridge]
 (The Aquatic ship drops into normal space and tiny
Enterprise flies out of its belly.)
T'POL: Distance?
TRAVIS: Eight hundred thousand kilometres.
T'POL: Set a course, Ensign.
(Hoshi enters.)
T'POL: You should be in your quarters.
HOSHI: With all due respect to Phlox, I wouldn't miss this for the
world.
TUCKER: (at T'Pol's station) Mind if we take a look?
(Everyone stares at the image of a blue-white planet in the middle of
the viewscreen.)
TUCKER: Prettiest sight I ever saw. It's all in one piece.
REED: The Captain would be proud.
T'POL: Open a channel to Starfleet Headquarters.
HOSHI: Strange.
TUCKER: What?
HOSHI: They're not responding.
REED: You'd think they'd be waiting with bated breath.
T'POL: Try another frequency.
TRAVIS: I'm not picking up the orbital platforms.
REED: The Reptilians destroyed Yosemite Station.
TRAVIS: It's not just Yosemite. There's nothing coming from any of
them.
HOSHI: I've rotated through all the frequencies.
T'POL: Contact the Lunar One colony.
HOSHI: I already tried.
T'POL: (to Tucker) Prepare a shuttlepod. I want you and Ensign
Mayweather to get down to San Francisco. Find out what's wrong.
 [Shuttlepod]
 (They fly in over the Golden Gate Bridge.)
TRAVIS: Looks pretty normal to me.
TUCKER: Then why the hell doesn't anyone want to talk to us? Land at
the pad behind the Command Centre.
TRAVIS: Finally. We've got three vessels approaching.
TUCKER: It's about time. This is Commander Charles Tucker of the
Starship Enterprise. You guys gave us quite a (rat-a-tat on the hull)
What the hell? (rat-a-tats continue)
TRAVIS: Sir.
(Anti-aircraft flax is steaming up from the ground and three propeller
driven USAF aircraft are coming at them.)
 [Field Hospital]
 (Conscious but badly wounded people are being
tended by nurses and doctors. One nurse whispers to a doctor tapping at
a big old typewriter. The background chatter is German, there is a
swastika flag on the wall, the dialogue is in subtitles.)
OFFICER: Where is he?
DOCTOR: Follow me. He was brought in yesterday. He's been badly burned.
(they go to Archer's cot) Do you recognise the uniform?
(The camera pans round from the doctor to the SS officer, and another,
and another - who is a pale and nasty looking alien.)

Storm
Front, part 1
 Original Airdate: 8 Oct, 2004
  T'POL
[OC]: Previously on Enterprise.

DANIELS [Future] : This species has technology which allows them to examine
alternate timelines.
They've seen this future and they want to change the outcome.
REED [Armoury]: We've got less than ten hours before this weapon reaches Earth.
The captain wants to take a team aboard to destroy it.
ARCHER [Weapon control area]: Give me the charges.
REED: I'll take care of it, sir.
ARCHER: Don't worry. I'll be right behind you.
(Scene of Archer running along the gantry, with explosions around him,
then an external of the Xindi weapon exploding outside Earth's
atmosphere.)
REED [Airlock]: Captain Archer destroyed the weapon.
TUCKER: Where is he? Is he okay?
REED: Captain didn't make it, Trip.
T'POL [Bridge]: Prepare a shuttlepod. I want you and Ensign Mayweather to get
down to San Francisco. Find out what's wrong.
TRAVIS [Shuttlepod]: Sir.
(Anti-aircraft flax and three propeller USAF planes come at them.)
OFFICER [Field Hospital]: Where is he?
DOCTOR: He's been badly burned. Do you recognise the uniform?
(Our first view of the red-eyed, grey skinned nasty alien in SS
uniform.)
[Shuttlepod]
TUCKER: This is Commander Charles Tucker of the
starship Enterprise.
(The shuttlepod continues to be strafed by gunfire.)
TUCKER: What the hell are you people doing?
TRAVIS: Those are P-51s. I've seen them at air shows.
TUCKER: I don't think this is an air show.
TRAVIS: Are they breaking off? Maybe we should follow them.
TUCKER: Try to find a landing port. Set us down.
(Anti-aircraft fire finally hits them.)
TRAVIS: Starboard injector.
TUCKER: Get us out of here!
(The pod climbs up out of range.)
[Country road]
(A German convoy is travelling through a lightly
wooded area. Archer is in the back of an open truck, with one of the SS
officers.)
OFFICER: Rita Hayworth. Veronica Lake. Betty Grable. Americans are good
at making movies.
They're not so good at fighting. Some day, I will go to Hollywood and I
will meet Betty Grable. Maybe you will introduce me, huh? What do you
think?
ARCHER: She's not your type.
OFFICER: You know, in Hollywood movies, Americans always win. Too bad
for you, you're not in a movie.
(There's a roadside explosion.)
OFFICER: Insurgents!
(A driver is shot, and the soldier with the officer. Archer keeps down.)
OFFICER: Keep driving! Move! Move!
(There's a roadside explosion, then gunfire. The insurgents have the
upper hand, so Archer kicks the officer, knocks him out, and makes a
run for it. One of the gun men shoots him too, but not seriously. He is
taken prisoner by a man in a hat, blue suit and red shirt.)
[Situation room]
CHURCHILL [OC]: As to the youth of all the Britons,
I say, you cannot stop.
There is no halting-place at this point. We have now reached a point in
the journey where there can be no pause.
We must go on. It must be world anarchy or world order.
HOSHI: That was Winston Churchill. I picked that up half an hour ago.
REED: Well, it's true then. We're over two hundred years in the past.
HOSHI: I've also intercepted several military dispatches and their
radio programme, something called The Shadow.
T'POL: We should run a complete diagnostic. Start with the sensor
array.
TUCKER: This isn't a damn sensor glitch. We just pulled three fifty
calibre bullets from the shuttlepod hull. And spare us the official
Vulcan position about time travel. We are two hundred years in the
past. Face it.
T'POL: The first step to getting back is ascertaining how we got here.
As soon as the diagnostic
is complete, run a scan for any anomalies in the area.
REED: Right away. (Reed leaves.)
TRAVIS: Maybe we're here for a reason. Maybe this wasn't an accident.
T'POL: For the moment, we can't rule out any possibilities. (As a crewwoman walks along a corridor, a Suliban
appears, crawling along the ceiling. It's Silik. He drops to the floor
when the coast is clear and walks away.)
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
(Two of the aliens are discussing recent events,
while watching scientists through a window.)
GHRATH: The Germans believe there are five thousand resistance fighters
operating throughout the region.
They're becoming better organized, increasing their attacks. We lost
four men in the assault.
VOSK: You should have chosen a safer route, and you should have
personally overseen the transfer.
GHRATH: We were in the midst of a crucial weapons test. He was just an
American prisoner.
VOSK: He was more than that. This communication device he was carrying.
It's from the future.
GHRATH: A temporal agent?
VOSK: Double the security details at all the entrances to the compound.
If they have located us, it won't be long before they strike.
GHRATH: How could they have possibly found us?
VOSK: If the prisoner hadn't escaped, we might know the answer to that
question. You know what I expect of you.
GHRATH: The prisoner will be recovered.
[Ready room]
T'POL: Come in.
TUCKER: You got a second? I wanted to say, I was way out of line
earlier. You have enough to worry about without me flying off the
handle.
T'POL: Your reaction was understandable.
TUCKER: I was just all set to get home. I wasn't expecting to be in the
middle of another situation.
T'POL: None of us were. I was also looking forward to going home. I
thought perhaps I would return to Vulcan. It's been some time since I
was there.
TUCKER: Sounds nice. I was gonna lay on a different beach every week
for two months. The only thing to figure out was whether to start in
Tahiti or in Cancun. The Captain would always try to put the best light
on the worst situation. I wonder what he'd say to this one.
T'POL: I think he'd be hard-pressed to find any positive aspects. But
he would try, nevertheless. (door chime) Come in.
REED: I've been going over those military dispatches that Hoshi picked
up. Some of them don't make sense. They mention recent battles in
Virginia and Ohio. There weren't any battles fought there in World War
II. The Nazis never got to North America. Something's very wrong down
there.
[Sickbay]
(Porthos is still pining, and even refusing food.)
PHLOX: It's chicken liver, your favourite. With grated cheddar. No, I
can't say I blame you. I don't have much of an appetite myself. Perhaps
a Denobulan lullaby will improve your mood? On the other hand, my
singing would often drive my children to tears. Maybe what you need is
a nice, thick steak. I'll see what Chef has on the menu. Be right back.
(But as he gets up to go, the Sickbay doors open to reveal - Daniels!
but looking very unwell indeed. He collapses into Phlox's arms,)
[Apartment]
(Archer is lying unconscious on a sofa, having his
injuries tended to by a lovely black woman. Then he wakes with a start.)
ALICIA: Hey, hey, it's okay, it's all right. I'm a friend Just cleaning
you up a little. War's a dirty business. But you're lucky. Bullet just
missed the bone.
ARCHER: Where am I?
ALICIA: You're in my apartment, what's left of it. I'm Alicia Travers.
ARCHER: Jonathan Archer.
ALICIA: Pleased to meet you. What's the last thing you remember?
ARCHER: I was in a truck with a couple of German soldiers. There was an
explosion, someone
started shooting at us. I got away.
ALICIA: You sure did. And your SS friends, they're dead, which is how I
like them. You're my first bona fide POW. I usually fix up guys in the
resistance. (Archer tries to sit up) Easy. Easy, easy, easy, sailor.
You don't want to start bleeding again.
ARCHER: Sailor?
ALICIA: That patch on your shirt says Enterprise. You must have made it
off before it sank. How'd you wind up all the way over here?
ARCHER: I've been asking myself the same question. (goes to look out of
the broken window. The street scene is of German soldiers, piles of
smouldering rubbish, and trucks passing by) What year is this?
ALICIA: It's 1944.
ARCHER: World War Two.
ALICIA: I haven't heard it called that before, but that's as good a
description as any.
Used to be a pretty nice neighbourhood, even for coloureds. As you can
see, it's gone downhill. (Archer sees the remains of the 'Stop 'n' Go Cleaners.)
ARCHER: Where are we?
ALICIA: We in Brooklyn. New York City?
[Nazi HQ]
(It's a beautiful white house with a porticoed
entrance, and part of the left corner damaged. It's not big enough to
be the White House. There are tanks parked on the manicured front lawn.  A film is being shown in a darkened room.)
VOSK: The weapon fires a modulating plasma pulse equivalent to the
energy produced by three eighty eight millimetre shells.
Each pulse can destroy a tank.
GENERAL: (human) Very impressive. When can we expect deployment?
VOSK: I can't give you a specific timetable. There are still some
problems to be addressed.
GENERAL: Such as?
VOSK: Portability. The weapons require considerable power. In my
century, there are energy cells the size of a coin. In this century,
it's somewhat more difficult. (hands over a folder)
GENERAL: What are these?
VOSK: Requisition forms. I require additional supplies.
GENERAL: (reading) Eighty six metric tons of aluminum plating, a
hundred and seventy tons of carbon steel.
We can't keep diverting vital materials from war production!
VOSK: We are inside the home of a former American President. It seems
to me your war effort is going well enough.
GENERAL: That could change, very quickly. Intelligence suggests the
Americans are preparing a counterattack.
Our front lines are dangerously thin, supply routes are under constant
attack from resistance fighters.
A forceful enemy thrust could stand a good chance of breaking through.
On top of this, there've been setbacks in Africa, and the Russians are
attempting to retake Moscow.
Though no one has expressed this to the Fuhrer, there is widespread
belief that Germany has advanced
too far, too quickly.
VOSK: All the more reason to accede to my request. The weapons I'm
preparing will make you immune
from any counterattack, anywhere in the world, and I'm not just
referring to plasma rifles.
Imagine a plague targeting non-Aryans. No need for extermination camps.
Just a few grams of a pathogen
introduced into the water supply.
GENERAL: You make promises. All we ever see are films!
VOSK: There's far too much at stake for us to argue. We have far too
much in common.
We both embrace the ideals of purity and perfection, and we both face
enemies that would destroy us.
Now is not the time to end an association that is vital to our mutual
survival.
GENERAL: No one has proposed ending anything.
VOSK: Then I'll expect delivery by the end of the week.
[Sickbay]
(Daniels is on oxygen and an array of drips, while
his innards are on the main display.)
PHLOX: Portions of Daniels' body have aged at a dramatic rate. In some
areas, the tissue is over
a hundred years old. Yet, other sections have been reduced to an almost
foetal stage.
T'POL: Do you have any theories as to what caused this?
PHLOX: It's not any kind of infectious organism, at least, nothing that
shows up on my medical scanner.
T'POL: Will he survive?
PHLOX: Frankly, with his amount of cellular chaos, I'm surprised he's
still alive. I doubt he'll live more than 24 hours.
T'POL: He very well could be responsible for our being here. He could
also be the only hope of getting back to our own time. It is imperative
that I speak with him.
[Alicia's apartment]
(Outside, men are being rounded up, and those who
resist are being shot. Three men enter the apartment building. There's
a knock on Alicia's door, and she answers it with a gun in her hand.
It's the three men.)
SAL: (the guy in the blue suit and red shirt) Vic's been arrested.
ALICIA: When?
CARMINE: (a big fellow) A few hours ago.
SAL: The Gestapo's clearing out entire buildings, shooting people on
the street. They're looking for you. The Germans are offering ten
thousand dollars for information leading to your capture. Why?
ARCHER: Can't tell you.
SAL: Look, you son of a bitch, my friend is probably being tortured
right now. I want to know why.
ARCHER: It's classified. (Sal points his gun at Archer's head.)
SAL: I won't tell anyone.
ALICIA: Sal!
SAL: Shut up! You got three seconds. One, two, three. (Carmine pushes his hand away.)
CARMINE: Come on, Sal. take it easy. Take it
easy. Come on, now. Easy, easy.
ARCHER: All I can tell you is we're on the same side.
SAL: Damn military. You cut and run, you leave us at the mercy of these
Nazi bastards.
ARCHER: I didn't cut and run.
SAL: Oh, yeah, yeah, I forgot. It was an orderly retreat. (A siren
wails along the street.) SAL: Vic might break. If he talks, it won't be safe
here.
ALICIA: We've been through this.
SAL: Alicia.
ALICIA: This is my home. I'm not leaving.
SAL: We're going to see if we can find out any more information about
Vic.
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: He's conscious, but I don't know for how
long.
DANIELS: Where's Captain Archer?
PHLOX: Captain Archer is dead. He was on the Xindi weapon when it
exploded. Are you responsible for sending us back in time? (Daniels
nods feebly) Why?
DANIELS: The Temporal Cold War has become an all-out conflict. Temporal
agents, dozens of them stationed throughout the timeline. They've been
given orders to change history.
T'POL: For what purpose?
DANIELS: Each faction is trying to wipe the others out. It's a fight
for dominance.
T'POL: Daniels. The events of this period don't correspond with
recorded history. Germany has launched a successful invasion of the
United States.
DANIELS: Different incursions are causing paradoxes. Turbulence in the
time stream. I almost didn't make it back.
(He has a spasm of pain.)
T'POL: How do we return to our century?
DANIELS: You can't. It doesn't exist. Not the way you know it. Neither
does mine. It's all gone. You have to stop him
T'POL: Stop who? Daniels. Stop who?
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
(The two aliens walk down a corridor and into a
laboratory.)
GHRATH: We're conducting extensive sweeps within a fifteen mile radius
of the ambush. We haven't found the prisoner, but we have taken in
several members of the resistance. They're being interrogated. There's
one that I suspect took part in the ambush.
VOSK: We're picking up scans from a ship in orbit. It's from the same
time period as the device we found
on the escaped prisoner. This resistance member you're interrogating.
GHRATH: Yes?
VOSK: Bring him to me.
[Alicia's apartment]
(It's dinner time. Archer has changed out of his
uniform into normal clothes for the period.)
ALICIA: Not bad.
ARCHER: Where is your husband now?
ALICIA: He's in the Pacific, on a destroyer. I hear the war isn't going
any better over there. Don't be expecting a second course.
ARCHER: It's not bad.
ALICIA: You're a rotten liar. All the good stuff goes to the Germans. I
still can't believe it. You know, that they're actually here. I'll
never forget the day I saw that first German tank rolling up Flatbush.
All the people streaming across the Brooklyn Bridge, trying to get out
of Manhattan. The President on the radio, vowing to persevere, right
before the government evacuated Washington. (music starts up) Right on
time. BILLIE [OC]: (and behind dialogue) My old flame
ARCHER: Billie Holiday.
ALICIA: Good to know there's something that your remember.
BILLIE [OC]: I can't even think of his name.
(They go out onto the balcony to listen better.)
But it's funny now and then, how my thoughts go flashing back again, to my old flame.
ALICIA: Germans outlawed coloured music. Some of the neighbours pass a
phonograph from house to house every night, so the Germans can't find
it. Just another way of telling 'em off.
BILLIE [OC]: For I haven't met a gent so magnificent.
ARCHER: Alicia, I'm going to ask you something. It's going to sound a
little strange.
ALICIA: What else is new? BILLIE [OC]: I've met so many men, some who sent me up to the skies.
ARCHER: When I was in a German medical tent, one of the soldiers who
came in to see me wasn't like the other ones. He had grey skin, red
eyes. He wasn't human. This isn't the first time you've heard something
like this.
ALICIA: Sal mentioned some stories once, but I didn't believe them.
ARCHER: They may be more than stories. I need to track down this
soldier I saw. It's very important. Would you contact Sal?
[Launch bay]
TUCKER: EPS conduit's fried. Get to Engineering,
and pull a fresh one out of the injector assembly.
WALSH: Yes, Commander.
(He leaves, then a shadow passes over Trip and he looks up.)
TUCKER: Walsh?
(Tucker starts scanning the area.)
SILIK: Commander.
TUCKER: Silik. You son of a bitch. (Silik indicates the shuttlepod with his weapon.)
SILIK: Climb in.
TUCKER: You brought us here.
SILIK: No.
TUCKER: Then who did?
SILIK: What's happening is beyond your comprehension. Get in the
shuttlepod. I would rather not have to discharge this weapon.
(Tucker moves to the pod, then pulls the hatch down and disarms Silik.
They fight, but Silik escapes Tucker's grip by turning squidgy and
wriggling out. Then he gets his weapon and stuns Tucker.)
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: Bay one is depressurising. Someone's
launching a shuttlepod.
T'POL: Hail them.
REED: I'm picking up one life sign aboard. It's Suliban.
T'POL: Phase-cannons.
(As the pod heads for Earth, four shots lance out, and one appears to
hit it.)
[Street - steps to closed subway]
CARMINE: If this Nazi wasn't a human, what was he,
then?
ALICIA: I don't know.
ARCHER: Just tell Sal I want to talk to him.
CARMINE: All right. (He gives Alicia something wrapped in newspaper.) CARMINE: Here,
it's hamburger. Germans are cutting the meat ration again. It's gonna
be worth its weight in gold.
ALICIA: Thanks, Carmine.
CARMINE: Watch yourselves. (Carmine leaves them.)
ALICIA: Used to be we'd get meat on Wednesdays and Fridays. Then it was
just Wednesdays. (They walk down the street.) ALICIA: Nazis blame the
resistance, say we're disrupting the food shipment.
ARCHER: Makes the Germans feel like heroes.
ALICIA: Yeah.
ARCHER: Fighting to feed the people.
(Two German soldiers notice them and walk over.)
ARCHER: Look.
ALICIA: No eye contact. (She dumps the meat.)
GERMAN: Why do you walk with her?
ARCHER: Why not?
GERMAN: Do you like Negroes?
ALICIA: We don't want any trouble.
GERMAN: Shut up, bitch. Do we make you angry?
ARCHER: You could say that.
(Archer takes Alicia's arm and hustles her away.)
GERMAN: When we send her back to Africa, you can go along. You can run
through the jungles together.
ALICIA: Like I said, neighbourhood's gone downhill.
[Situation room]
T'POL: Before he lost consciousness, Daniels told
me there was someone we had to stop.
TUCKER: At least now we know who he was talking about.
T'POL: Can you get a fix on the shuttlepod?
REED: He disabled the transponder. However, we are picking up trace
plasma signatures, probably from the damage. I think I can get us
within three kilometres of where it went down.
T'POL: That will have to suffice.
TUCKER: Thing I can't understand, why'd he go to the trouble of saving
my life? He pulled me out of the Launch bay before he depressurised it.
REED: Another item on our list of things to ponder.
[Street]
SAL: Curfew starts in an hour. We got to move fast.
ALICIA: Yeah, sometimes the Germans don't wait for curfew.
CARMINE: Can't get used to all this skulking around.
SAL: I know what you mean. We used to own this neighbourhood.
ALICIA: Yeah, tell him what you guys did before the war.
SAL: Nothing to tell. We were delegates for the Construction Workers
Union.
ALICIA: Right. The loan-sharkinq was just a part-time job.
CARMINE: We helped people get out of financial difficulty. Since when
is that a crime?
ALICIA: When they didn't pay you back on time. That's where the crime
part came in.
SAL: Come on, let's go.
[Alleyway]
SAL: This guy's a welsher and a drunk. I wouldn't
put too much stock into what comes out of his mouth.
ARCHER: I'll keep that in mind.
SAL: I'm only doing this because Alicia asked. Don't forget that.
JOE: What's this all about?
SAL: I want you to tell him what you told me, about your customer.
JOE: Who are you?
CARMINE: Just shut up and tell him.
JOE: I can't talk and shut up at the same time.
CARMINE: Talk!
JOE: The man comes to me for information. Sometimes he asks about the
resistance, sometimes he asks
about the Gestapo. He's keeping tabs on both sides. Me? I don't know
squat, so I make stuff up. He pays good.
ARCHER: What's he look like?
JOE: He always wears a hat. Stays in the shadows. I caught a glimpse of
him once. He ain't like nobody
I ever seen, that's for sure. It's the red eyes I can't forget.
ARCHER: I want to talk to him.
JOE: Forget it. That ain't part of the deal.
ALICIA: Sal.
SAL: What you owe me, take twenty percent off.
CARMINE: Damn, Sal.
SAL: What? I'm a generous guy.
JOE: I don't know...
SAL: Hey, You think the Germans are tough? Get me in a bad mood.
[Wood, at night]
(Two figures materialise and go walking. They pass a field gun.)
TUCKER: Artillery.
TRAVIS: Hard to believe we're only a few kilometres from New York City.
TUCKER: It's hard to believe this is Earth. (His scanner beeps.) TUCKER: Plasma
signature. That way.
 [Deleted scene - Alleyway,
night]
 SAL: (lighting a cigar) Could be the last
Cuban in the city.
ARCHER: No thanks.
SAL: You don't know what you're missing.
ARCHER: I got a pretty good idea.
SAL: I read in a magazine once the Germans were doing medical
experiments on people. Well, maybe that's what you saw, one of their
experiments.
ARCHER: I hadn't considered it.
SAL: A lot of weird stories floating around. The Germans working on new
weapons, guns that shoot light instead of bullets. Turn people into
dust. It all sounds like one of those stories that guy, Orson Welles,
dreamed up.
ARCHER: Rat. Orson Welles. War of the Worlds. My engineer played it for
me once.
SAL: How'd he do that?
ARCHER: A friend at a radio station made a recording.
SAL: You know all those people who panicked? I was one of them. I fell
for the whole thing. I called my sister in Jersey, I told her the
Martians were coming. She broker her ankle racing for the car. It cost
me a fortune in medical bills. Sometimes I wish the Martians had come.
ARCHER: I'm sure you would have given them a run for their money.
 SAL: We're keeping the Germans busy, more and more of
us every day. Irish gangs, dockworkers, coloureds, even broads. Some of
these women, they can shoot the fleas off a tick. When the war's over,
I got half a mind to put them on the payroll.
(they see someone in an overcoat and hat coming)
SAL: Here. (offering a gun) It's loaded.
(Archer takes it)
Prazki?
(the stranger also has a gun, and raises it when he sees Archer)
GHRATH: You.
ALICIA: Throw the gun down.
CARMINE: You're not following directions. That's how people get hurt.
SAL: You'd better take her advice.
GHRATH: What do you want?
CARMINE: Holy mother of
[Crashed shuttlepod]
(Both doors are open, and no one is home.)
TUCKER: Tucker to Enterprise.
[Bridge]
T'POL: T'Pol.
TUCKER [OC]: We found it.
[Crashed shuttlepod]
TUCKER: No sign of Silik.
[Bridge]
T'POL: What's the shuttlepod's condition?
[Crashed shuttlepod]
TUCKER: I'll need some more time before I'll know
if it'll fly.
[Alleyway]
(Grath is being thoroughly frisked by Archer.)
SAL: You ever see anything like that before?
CARMINE: Maybe he's wearing some kind of mask.
SAL: That's no mask.
ARCHER: (finding a device) Who are you? Answer me.
GHRATH: I have nothing to say to you.
CARMINE: How about if we pulled out your tongue?
GHRATH: You're not what I expected. Temporal agents are usually more
informed.
SAL: What in the hell is a temporal agent?
GHRATH: You wouldn't understand.
SAL: Listen, you freak.
ARCHER: Why are you changing history? You're helping the Germans win
the war. Why?
GHRATH: Because it suits us.
SAL: How does this suit you? (Sal shoots him in the hand. He bleeds yellow.)
ARCHER: Sal, no! Damn it!
SAL: It's better than he deserves.
CARMINE: Get your hands off him!
SAL: You want answers, don't you?
ARCHER: Not like that.
CARMINE: Just say the word, Sal. I'll take him out right here.
SAL: The hell with it.
ARCHER: I don't know how long I can hold them off. You better talk to
me. Now, who are you? What are you doing here?
GHRATH: We're trapped. The Germans are helping us construct a conduit
so we can find our way home.
ARCHER: You said I was a temporal agent.
GHRATH: We know you're from the future. We detected your ship in orbit.
ARCHER: My ship.
GHRATH: It has the same markings that were on your uniform.
ARCHER: I need to contact them. Can I do it with this? (He holds up the
device he found.  A siren wails.)
SAL: We better get out of here.
ARCHER: The conduit. Where's it being built?
GHRATH: You find it.
ALICIA: Come on. Come on!
VOSK: You won't stop us. When we get back, you'll never have existed.
(Sal shoots him dead.)
[Crashed shuttlepod]
TUCKER: EPS system's completely fused. It could
take a week.
[Bridge]
REED: I'm picking up movement in the area. Looks
like several vehicles.
T'POL: Commander.
[Crashed shuttlepod]
TUCKER: I heard. Moving to Plan B. What about
Silik?
[Bridge]
TUCKER [OC]: We gotta find him.
T'POL: We will. One problem at a time.
[Street]
CARMINE: Jesus, he looked like some kind of demon.
ALICIA: His blood wasn't even red.
SAL: Was that my imagination, or did he say something about being from
the future?
CARMINE: He meant him.
ARCHER: (into Ghrath's device) Archer to Enterprise.
SAL: You want any more of our help, you're gonna tell us what's going
on. What was that back there?
ARCHER: That was an extraterrestrial.
SAL: A Martian?
ARCHER: I don't know what planet he was from.
SAL: Well, where are you from?
ARCHER: Upstate New York.
ALICIA: Fellas. A lot of people out past curfew.
(A guy rummaging in a rubbish bin, another lounging on a bench, and
someone else watching from a window.)
CARMINE: I don't like the looks of this.
SAL: We gotta get out of here.
(Germans come rushing out of a building.)
SAL: Move.
(The Germans let rip with a machine gun, and Sal is shot in the back.)
CARMINE: Sal! (to Archer and Alicia) Get out of here!
(He returns fire and kills some Germans while others chase Alicia and
Archer down an alleyway. They hide behind some barrels while Alicia
keeps shooting.)
ARCHER: Enterprise, come in. Enterprise.
ALICIA: What are you doing?
ARCHER: Enterprise!
ALICIA: (running out of ammunition) Whoever you're calling, they're not
going to get here in time.
[Crashed shuttlepod]
TUCKER: Charges are set.
(A jeep full of soldiers turns up, with dogs, and gather around the
shuttlepod. Trip presses buttons on his scanner and runs for it. BANG!
He and Travis run onto the road but a motorbike and sidecar come along,
so they stand still.)
[Bridge]
REED: It's done.
HOSHI: I've lost them.
T'POL: The explosion may have disrupted their comm. signal.
HOSHI: I'm picking up another signal. It's faint.
T'POL: Let's hear it.
ARCHER [OC]: Captain Archer to Enterprise. Come in. Enterprise, come
in.
T'POL: Captain?
[Alleyway]
T'POL [OC]: Your transmission is very weak. Do you
read me?
(Vosk arrives.)
ARCHER: T'Pol. Two to transport.
VOSK: Leave your weapons on the ground and stand up slowly. (Archer and
Alicia come out, hands up.) VOSK: We have a great deal to talk about.
ARCHER: (as they are beamed out) It'll have to wait.
(Vosk grabs a machine gun and fires as they disappear.)
[Transporter alcove]
ARCHER: You're all right. You're on my ship.
ALICIA: How did we get here?
ARCHER: It's kind of complicated.
ALICIA: Promise you won't do that again.
ARCHER: I promise.
(He takes her hand and leads her away.)
[Bridge]
HOSHI: Captain! (She rushes over and hugs him.)
REED: Welcome home.
ARCHER: We're not quite home yet, but it's good to be back. I guess I
have some catching up to do. Status?
(T'Pol looks like she wants to burst into tears and hug him too.)
[Corridor]
T'POL: Several vehicles converged on the area
moments before the shuttlepod exploded.
ARCHER: Keep searching. This is one of the aliens' communicators. Take
it apart. Figure out how to monitor their transmissions.
[Sickbay]
(Porthos comes rushing over to his master.)
PHLOX: It's nice to see you again, Captain.
ARCHER: I hope it's the last time you'll have to look after Porthos.
PHLOX: It was a pleasure, as always.
ARCHER: Is he awake?
PHLOX: He doesn't have much time.
DANIELS: Jonathan.
ARCHER: Who are they?
DANIELS: The most dangerous faction of the Cold War. They're led by
Vosk, a fanatic violently opposed to the Temporal Accords.
ARCHER: Stay with me. Stay with me.
DANIELS: We almost captured him, but he developed a form of stealth
time travel. He escaped into the past. We eventually located him, but
it was too late. He returned to my century. He and his people defeated
us and launched this war that's destroying all of time. I've sent you
to this point because it's here that Vosk can be stopped. If you
succeed, the war will never happen. The timeline will be restored.
ARCHER: One of his people told me they were building a conduit.
DANIELS: Vosk's time travel device had a drawback. It was a one-way
trip. He needed to construct the conduit to get home, but he was forced
to use technology from this time period. The machine would have to be
enormous. Find it. Destroy it. He must not succeed. Stop him. (Daniels dies.)
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
(Tucker and Travis are hustled into Vosk's laboratory.)
VOSK: Your colleague has managed to evade us. I assure you, whatever I
want to know, you'll tell me gratefully. (to the soldiers) I'll be
supervising another test. Notify me when they're ready for questioning.
(Travis and Tucker are dragged out again, and Vosk goes to supervise his
enormous conduit.)

Storm
Front, part two
 Original Airdate: 15 Oct, 2004
  ARCHER
[OC]: Previously, on Enterprise
 TUCKER [Situation
room]: We just pulled three fifty calibre bullets from
the shuttlepod
hull. We are two hundred years in the past.
OFFICER [Roadside ambush]:
Insurgents!
(Archer's escape from the Nazi's.)
VOSK [Nazi Weapons Facility]: Your
colleague has managed to evade us. I assure you, whatever I
want to know, you'll tell me.
ARCHER [Alicia's apartment]: Where
are we?
ALICIA: We in Brooklyn.
VOSK [Nazi HQ - Vosk's office]: The
weapons I'm preparing will make you immune from any
counterattack anywhere in the world.
SAL [Alicia's Apartment]: The
Germans were offering ten thousand dollars for information
leading to your capture. Why?
ARCHER: All I can tell you is we're on the same side.
CARMINE [Alleyway]: (on
seeing his first non-human) Holy mother of
GHRATH: We're trapped. The Germans are helping us construct a conduit
so we can find our way home.
DANIELS [Sickbay]:
I've sent you to this point because it's here that Vosk can be
stopped. If you succeed, the timeline will be restored.
ARCHER: One of these people told me they were building a conduit.
DANIELS: Find it. Destroy it. He must not succeed. Stop him.
ARCHER [OC]: And now, the conclusion.
 NEWSREEL: News On Parade! America and Germany
together in the fight for freedom. In his first visit to the home of
the Brave, the German chancellor received a warm welcome from the Big
Apple! He greeted enthusiastic crowds in Times Square and took in the
view from the top of the Empire State Building. Watch that first step!
Later, the Fuhrer paid a call to Lady Liberty, where he was given the
keys to the city! The whirlwind tour was capped off by a four-hour
speech to city leaders, where the Fuhrer outlined his vision for a
prosperous alliance between Germany and America. Vowing to root out the
parasitic elements that have crippled our economy since 1929 and to
liberate the masses from the grip of financial profiteers, Together, we
will put Americans back to work. Two great nations marching side by
side toward a bold future!
(The Nazi flag is above the US one on the flagpole.)
[Nazi HQ - Vosk's office]
GENERAL: Our intelligence sources are convinced
that the American counterattack will be launched within days. It's no
longer a rumour. It's fact.
VOSK: I assume you're taking the necessary steps.
(He sees the document in
the General's hands.)
VOSK: What is that?
GENERAL: An intelligence briefing. According to this, your squadron
performed flawlessly in recent field tests.
VOSK: You've been spying on us.
GENERAL: We're protecting our interests.
VOSK: I suppose I would've done the same. Tell your Fuhrer he'll
receive the squadron when I deem it ready for deployment.
GENERAL: This says it is ready for deployment.
VOSK: With all due respect, your intelligence is flawed.
GENERAL: We are tired of your stalling!
VOSK: And I am tired of your threats.
GENERAL: You and your men have taken an oath to defend Germany!
VOSK: We take that oath seriously.
GENERAL: Do you?
VOSK: You've made certain promises to me as well.
GENERAL: We've provided everything you've asked for. You'll not receive
a single truckload of additional supplies till you fulfill your part of
the agreement.
VOSK: General, you might consider what would happen if my weapons were
to fall into the hands of the Allies. Imagine Berlin obliterated by
plasma cannons.
GENERAL: I should have you arrested for treason.
VOSK: You are a fool. You think we're equals because I allow you to
participate in this struggle. You fight to control nations. We dominate
entire worlds. We extend our will across time. If your race were to
endure for a million years, you couldn't begin to approach what we've
accomplished. The next time you feel the urge to threaten me, remember
this: I can erase you from history as if you never existed.
[Crew quarters]
(Alicia looking at a photograph in a frame.)
ALICIA: She
was around my age.
ARCHER: Twenty six.
ALICIA: Ensign O'Malley. How'd she die?
ARCHER: In a battle with a hostile species.
ALICIA: There's still war in the future?
ARCHER: On Earth, between human beings, war has been eliminated. But
the galaxy's a big place, with thousands of species.
Not all of them have the same values we have.
ALICIA: Spaceships. People from other planets. People from the future?
It's all a little too much for Alicia Travers from Bensonhurst.
Besides, I'm afraid of heights.
ARCHER: I can send you anywhere in the world. To a place that isn't
occupied by the Germans.
(Alicia looks down on Earth.)
ALICIA:
Seem to be fewer and fewer of those
places every day. I want to go home, to my neighbourhood. There are a
lot of people in trouble down there, and I'm not going to just turn my
back on them. But you knew I was going to say that, didn't you?
ARCHER: I had a feeling. Two of my men are missing. They could be
hiding out,
they might've been taken prisoner. They could be dead.
ALICIA: We've got eyes on every street corner. I can, I can put a word
out. Archer, with this ship, with all this power, you can help us. You
can help us stop those bastards.
ARCHER: I know.
ALICIA: Then do it. Start with Berlin. Wipe that damn place off the
map, and don't stop until you kill every last one of them, because what
they
ARCHER: We're going to stop them. That's one of the reasons we're here.
But we're going to do it another way.
ALICIA: Okay. I guess you know what you're doing. Are you going to
start by sending me down with that dissolver thing?
ARCHER: Shuttlepods are damaged. The transporter is all we have.
ALICIA: Archer, you promised me I wouldn't have to go through that
again.
ARCHER: I'm going to have to break that promise.
ALICIA: Okay. How does that thing work, anyway? On second thought, I'd
rather not know.
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
VOSK: Begin the test sequence.
KRAUL: Based on the interrogations, I believe the prisoners are not
temporal agents.
VOSK: I've arrived at the same conclusion. Their technology suggests
they're from a period too early for time travel.
KRAUL: They don't even seem to know how they got to this century. It's
curious.
VOSK: Still, I refuse to believe their presence here is an accident.
(The conduit activates, but it isn't stable and goes bang.)
SCIENTIST: There's a power surge in one of the power modules.
VOSK: Run a complete systems scan. Isolate the fault. Our time is
running out. The Germans are becoming impatient.
KRAUL: Why not give them what they want?
VOSK: I don't trust these people. I never have. I'm not about to
furnish them with weapons that could be used against us. Return the
prisoners to their holding cell. See that they get medical attention.
Go.
[Cell]
(Tucker and Travis are dropped onto the floor by
the
guards.)
VOSK: Bring the doctor immediately.
(The Germans clear the room, Tucker rolls over and thinks he sees a
figure crawling across the ceiling and then falling onto him.)
[Ready room]
REED: I think I've pinpointed where the timeline
changed. Someone assassinated Lenin in 1916.
ARCHER: Who took his place?
REED: No one. So without Lenin, the Bolsheviks never gained power.
Russia didn't become Communist, and Germany never considered it a
threat.
ARCHER: Hitler was able to concentrate on the West.
REED: After France, Belgium and the Netherlands fell. Hitler quickly
took England and then the eastern United States.
T'POL: But Vosk and his men arrived on Earth recently. A few years ago.
ARCHER: Then they couldn't have been responsible for the changes that
took place in 1916.
REED: The police never captured Lenin's assassin. Some bystanders
claimed that the killer vanished into thin air.
T'POL: Daniels said that different factions in the Temporal War are
changing history throughout the timeline. Maybe this assassin was
working for one of them.
REED: But I thought we were here to prevent Vosk from starting the
temporal war.
ARCHER: Chicken or the egg.
HOSHI [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
HOSHI [OC]: I'm receiving a transmission. It's Vosk.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: This is Captain Archer.
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
VOSK: Your voice sounds familiar, Captain. Have we
met?
[Bridge]
ARCHER: What do you want?
VOSK [OC]: I believe I have two of your men.
ARCHER: Are they all right?
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
VOSK: I think it would be mutually beneficial to
discuss this face to face.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: We can bring you aboard.
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
VOSK: I was thinking of a more neutral location.
There's a remote area outside the city.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: That's not what I'd consider neutral.
VOSK [OC]: You have scanners.
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
VOSK: Examine the area before coming down. I'll
have three men with me. And your crewmen.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: A few hours ago, you tried to kill me.
VOSK [OC]: The situation has changed.
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
VOSK: I'm sending you the coordinates. If you're
interested, meet me in one hour.
[Bridge]
HOSHI: Got 'em.
[Road through the wood]
(Archer beams down with two MACOs, then a covered
jeep approaches their position. Vosk and two soldiers get out.)
VOSK: It's good to see you again, Captain.
ARCHER: Where are my men?
(Vosk signals for Tucker and Travis to be let out the back of the
jeep.)
TUCKER: Captain! I don't believe it. How can you be
ARCHER: (interrupting him) Are you all right?
TUCKER: We weren't exactly treated like royalty.
VOSK: I apologise for the aggressiveness of our questioning.
TRAVIS: Aggressive?
VOSK: We were operating under a false impression.
TUCKER: We're okay.
ARCHER: Get back to the ship.
TUCKER: Wait a minute. You're coming with us.
ARCHER: Trip. (into communicator) Beam them up.
(The pair get taken up to safety.)
VOSK: You have your men, Captain. Now it's your turn to reciprocate.
ARCHER: How?
VOSK: I wish to discuss something with you.
ARCHER: Go on.
VOSK: A species with your level of technology doesn't possess the
capability for time travel.
ARCHER: We had a little help.
VOSK: As I suspected. What do you know about me?
ARCHER: I know that you're trapped here, and that you're trying to get
back to the twenty ninth century. I also know you've made a deal with
the Germans. They're giving you supplies, helping you build a time
machine.
VOSK: I see I was both right and wrong about you. You're not a temporal
agent. But you're here to do their bidding.
ARCHER: If you carry out your mission, if you make it back to the
twenty ninth century, you will ignite a war that will devastate the
timeline.
VOSK: You've only heard one side of the story, Captain. The temporal
agents who sent you here are a tyrannical sect imposing their will on
countless cultures throughout history.
They enforce the Temporal Accords, preserve the time line.
VOSK: They manipulate the time line to serve their own needs. If you've
ever dealt with them, then you know they do much more than watch
history unfold. They interfere with events. They have an agenda.
ARCHER: So do you.
VOSK: At least I don't hide my intentions. It's true, I don't agree
with the Temporal Accords. I believe that time travel is a technology
no different than your warp drive, to be utilized for the benefit of
all species. Societies, cultures can be improved through careful
manipulation of historical events.
ARCHER: Who decides what improvements are needed?
VOSK: I won't be drawn into a philosophical discussion. There's one
simple reason why you should help me, Captain.
ARCHER: And what's that?
VOSK: I can send you back to your century.
ARCHER: History's been changed. The century I left will be completely
different.
VOSK: Once I've defeated the temporal agents, I'll reverse the damage
done to your timeline. Your history will return to the way it was. I'm
severely limited by twentieth century Earth technology. The resources
aboard your ship will greatly accelerate my task. Go back. Reunite with
your crewmen, and consider what I have said.
[Sickbay]
ARCHER: How are they doing?
PHLOX: A few cuts and bruises.
TUCKER: What happened after we beamed up? You make some kind of deal?
ARCHER: He thinks we're considering it.
TUCKER: Are we?
PHLOX: Captain.
(He shows Archer a PADD.)
ARCHER: What'd you see down there?
TUCKER: We were in some huge building, like a factory. They're
constructing something big. The Germans are helping him.
TRAVIS: I overheard them talking. They mentioned something about a
Temporal conduit. I know it sounds crazy, but I think it's a time
machine.
ARCHER: Daniels sent us here to stop them from completing it. Problem
is, it's protected by some kind of energy shield.
(Archer is watching Trip carefully as he stands up. Phlox is by a comm.
unit. Suddenly, Tucker attacks Archer and as they struggle, he wriggles
like a Suliban to get away. In the corridor, 'Tucker is shot down by
MACOs. It's really Silik.)
[Alicia's apartment]
(Alicia is seeing to Carmine's injured leg.)
ALICIA: Who dressed this?
CARMINE: Nicky Giorgio. What do you want? He's a mechanic.
ALICIA: He should stick to cars. At least it doesn't look infected.
CARMINE: Could have been worse. Could have ended up like Sal.
ALICIA: It's a miracle you got away.
CARMINE: Guess you should know.
ALICIA: What's that supposed to mean?
CARMINE: (wincing) I heard a rumour. When the soldiers cornered you and
Archer, you two disappeared into thin air, like ghosts.
ALICIA: That's crazy
CARMINE: That's what I said. But then again, I didn't believe in Nazi
Martians, you know, not until I saw one myself.
(He takes a communicator
out of his pocket.)
CARMINE: Want to tell me what this is?
ALICIA: You went through my jacket?!
CARMINE: I was looking for a cigarette. What is it?
ALICIA: (trying to grab it) It's a radio.
CARMINE: I never seen a radio like this. It looks like that thing
Archer took off that Martian guy, or whatever he was.
ALICIA: (getting it back) Archer gave this to me so that I could talk
to him.
CARMINE: Talk to him? Where is he? Alicia, you've been like a little
sister to us. You're going to start keeping secrets now?
[Brig]
ARCHER: Where's my Engineer? Silik. This disk you
were carrying. It contains schematics of Vosk's facility. This is what
you came here for, isn't it?
SILIK: You persist in asking questions you know I will not answer.
(Archer opens the door and goes in.)
ARCHER:
I'll try answering them myself,
then. Your benefactor wants to do more than just project his image into
the past. He wants the technology to travel into the past. Somehow, he
found out that Daniels was sending Enterprise here, so you were ordered
to hitch a ride. Your mission was to break into Vosk's compound and
steal this.
SILIK: Tell me, how was I planning to send that to the future?
ARCHER: Maybe that's why you came back aboard. Maybe you need
Enterprise.
SILIK: An impressive display, Captain.
ARCHER: I'm glad you're not disappointed.
SILIK: Though I'm not implying you're correct in any of your
assumptions.
ARCHER: Of course not.
SILIK: But you don't have the answer you're seeking. The whereabouts of
your missing crewman.
(Archer pushes Silik up against the wall.)
ARCHER:
I think you left him
somewhere inside Vosk's compound. And for your sake, he'd better be
alive.
SILIK: You've changed, Captain.
ARCHER: (releasing him) And not at all for the better.
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
(Tucker wakes up in a small room with big pipes
running down one corner. His hands are tied, and voices can be heard.)
VOSK: (into communicator) A large amount of data has been stolen from
our computer system, Captain.
[Bridge]
VOSK [OC]: We found trace amounts of bioresidue.
The thief is from your time period.
ARCHER: He's Suliban. He's aboard my ship. He's a stowaway.
VOSK [OC]: We've encountered his faction before. I want to speak with
him.
ARCHER: I can't allow that.
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
VOSK: And I suppose you aren't examining the
technology he stole from us.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: I reserve that right.
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
VOSK: And I reserve the right to destroy you.
[Bridge]
VOSK [OC]: I have a plasma-cannon aimed at your
ship, Captain.
ARCHER: And I have phase-cannons aimed at your facility.
[[Nazi Weapons Facility]
VOSK: I want an answer to my proposal.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: The answer is no.
(At a nod from Vosk, a swastika-ed gun comes out from a rooftop and
starts firing. Enterprise shakes and an alarm sounds.)
ARCHER: Return fire.
T'POL: Their shields are still holding.
(Another hit blows a circuit.)
ARCHER: Travis.
[[Nazi Weapons Facility]
SCIENTIST: They're moving out of range.
KRAUL: We needed them.
VOSK: We'll complete our objective with the resources at hand. Resume
your work.
[Bridge]
REED: Engines took a serious hit. Weapons are down.
ARCHER: Get to work on repairs. (to T'Pol) Keep looking over those
schematics. Find a way to disable the shields protecting that compound.
[Brig]
ARCHER: I'm getting my crewman back. You're going
to help me get inside the facility.
SILIK: And then? Are you going to destroy it?
ARCHER: Yes.
SILIK: I don't care about your crewman, Captain, but I don't want Vosk
to succeed any more than you do. I'll help you. There is one problem. I
use my genetic enhancements to get inside the building. Your presence
will negate that advantage.
ARCHER: We'll work around it.
[Corridor to the Transporter alcove]
(Archer and Silik are in casual clothes for the
mission. T'Pol hands
over a PADD.)
T'POL: You should be able to deactivate the
shields from this console. Here's the procedure. The data from the disk
was extremely helpful.
SILIK: You're welcome.
ARCHER: When the shields are down, give us ten minutes, then destroy
the facility.
T'POL: Our targeting array is offline. We're in need of Commander
Tucker's skills.
ARCHER: Do what you can. Move in close, and fire point-blank if you
have to.
T'POL: Understood. Good luck.
(She beams them down.)
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
GENERAL: Three American divisions have crossed the
Ohio River. Two more are advancing from the south toward Washington.
By direct order from the Fuhrer, the squadron is to be transferred
immediately to Luftwaffe Regional Command. I am to personally oversee
the deployment.
VOSK: Weapons of this complexity require extensive training to operate.
GENERAL: We'll discuss the particulars once you've fulfilled your
obligation.
VOSK: Six hours.
GENERAL: Why the delay?
VOSK: The planes must be readied for transport.
GENERAL: Six hours.
(The General leaves.)
VOSK: We're leaving tonight. Begin preparations.
KRAUL: Each time we open a conduit, it collapses within seconds.
VOSK: Human leaders often speak of destiny. The conduit will hold.
(In his little room, Trip clambers up the pipes to
smash the light bulb, then uses the shards of glass to cut the ropes
around his wrists.)
[Street - night]
(Silik has a human face now.)
SILIK: How do I look?
Better? From my dealings with you and your crew, I'd come to believe
that your race was inherently unaggressive.
(Archer checks on a corpse in the street.)
ARCHER:
We've come a long way in a
short time.
SILIK: One thing is clear. When necessary, humans are fully capable of
reverting to old methods. The way you handled that Xindi threat was
extremely effective. No doubt it's the reason why Daniels chose you to
stop Vosk.
(They hide from an army patrol.)
ARCHER: Speaking of Vosk, seems to me that you both have a common
enemy, Daniels. Why hadn't you decided to work together?
SILIK: One doesn't join forces with Vosk.
ARCHER: He's found some partners here.
SILIK: They're only a means to an end. To him and his followers, other
species exist only to serve their needs.
ARCHER: Sounds like you and Vosk have some history.
SILIK: His faction once tried to eradicate the Suliban. They travelled
into our past, altered it to prevent our species from attaining
sentience.
ARCHER: Then how is it that you're here?
SILIK: He was stopped by the Temporal Agents.
ARCHER: Are you saying you owe Daniels' people your lives?
SILIK: They still oppose us, they're still our enemy. That will never
change.
(They come across a group of men around an oil drum fire.)
MAN: What the hell do you want?
ARCHER: I'm looking for Alicia Travers.
MAN: Who's asking?
ARCHER: My name's Archer.
CARMINE: Still hunting Martians?
ALICIA: You just missed Billie Holiday.
CARMINE: What are we going after this time? The Loch Ness monster?
[Bridge]
HOSHI: I'm picking up a surge of radio chatter.
Orders coming in German and English.
REED: There's heavy bombing. Most of it in eastern Pennsylvania and
southern Virginia. It could be an Allied attack.
T'POL: Could it pose a danger to the Captain?
REED: The closest fighting is a hundred kilometres south of New York
City. Incredible.
T'POL: What's our repair status?
REED: Engines are at thirty six percent. Manoeuvring thrusters are
offline.
T'POL: Weapons?
REED: The targeting array's fried. We'll be shooting in the dark.
[Street]
CARMINE: What's so important about this facility?
ARCHER: They're building weapons there. Extremely powerful weapons.
CARMINE: What I hear, you have some pretty powerful weapons yourself. I
made her tell me everything. Not that I believe all of it.
SILIK: Do we really need these people?
CARMINE: What do you mean, these people?
SILIK: I don't see how they can be of any use to us.
CARMINE: I'll tell you how I can be of use to you. How about I start
removing your teeth with my knuckles?
ARCHER: All right.
SILIK: Are you threatening me?
CARMINE: Hey, give the man a prize.
SILIK: Why would you do that?
CARMINE: I'm going to kill this guy.
ALICIA Carmine, Carmine! Archer, what do you want us to do?
CARMINE: Hey, I haven't signed off on this yet. Sal went along with
you, and look what it got him. If I'm gonna lose any more people,
they're better be a good reason.
ALICIA: Look, you know what, Carmine? I'm gonna make this real easy for
you. I'm gonna help him. All you have to do is decide whether or not
you're gonna help me.
[Nazi Weapons Facility - temporal conduit
machine]
(Vosk is standing on the platform, giving a speech,
as Tucker listens from a hiding place.)
VOSK: Our greatest scientist once said, Every moment we live, we are
moving through time. We've earned the right to chose which direction.
The mastery of time has allowed us to perfect ourselves. To reach our
full potential as a people and to vanquish those who oppose us. There's
just one last enemy to deal with. Soon, history will belong to us. We
will stretch out our hands and mold it according to our will. Not even
the gods of our ancestors could have imagined such power. My brothers,
we are going home.
(The alien scientists give a Nazi-style salute.)
[outside the Nazi Weapons Facility]
(The soldiers on guard have their night wrecked by
a car crashing through the gates and people shooting at them, and
throwing grenades.)
CARMINE: What a way to spend a Saturday night.
(Archer and Silik head for the main storage area. Silik is unarmed.)
SILIK: It only opens from the inside.
(he squeezes through an air vent)
CARMINE: There's too many of 'em! Come on!
(The New York gangsters are about to retreat when Alicia arrives with
another car load of reinforcements.)
CARMINE: It's nice to see you.
(Silik lets Archer inside.)
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
KRAUL: Insurgents. We don't know how many.
VOSK: A fortuitous development. Let the Germans deal with them.
Continue with the preparations.
(Meanwhile, in a corridor -)
ARCHER: We're in. We're making our way to the console.
T'POL [OC]: Our targeting array is still down.
[Bridge]
T'POL: We're going to have to drop out of orbit to
get close enough.
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
ARCHER: Understood.
[Bridge]
T'POL: Have you located Commander Tucker?
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
ARCHER: Not yet. It's second on my list, believe
me.
(They find a room full of drums, and a console.)
SILIK: Take cover.
(Two alien scientists walk past.)
SILIK: They're activating the conduit. Work fast, Captain.
(He does, and an alarm sounds.)
[Bridge]
REED: He did it.
T'POL: Take us in.
TRAVIS: Aye.
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
(Archer is exchanging weapons fire with a group of
soldiers.)
SILIK: We're in an extremely precarious position.
ARCHER: I hadn't noticed.
SILIK: It might help if I had a weapon.
ARCHER: Sorry, only one to go around.
(Archer returns some more fire, looks
around and he's gone.)
ARCHER: Silik.
(The Suliban has got the drop on the soldiers and is disposing of them
out with their own guns. He turns to Archer, smugly, then gets shot in
the back several times by one last German. Archer takes him out.)
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
KRAUL: The Earth ship has entered the atmosphere.
VOSK: Activate the plasma weapon.
KRAUL: We can't spare the power.
VOSK: Then deploy the squadron. Destroy them.
GENERAL: No! The squadron's going to the front.
VOSK: Execute my order.
GENERAL: I am taking command of this facility. You are relieved.
(Vosk shoots the General in the stomach, and kills his two guards
before they can ready their rifles.)
VOSK: I'm sorry, General, but I'm afraid I have to end our alliance.
(He administers the coup de grace.)
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise. Archer to Enterprise.
(Silik now looks Suliban again.)
SILIK:
They're in the atmosphere.
Ionisation. The signal can't penetrate.
ARCHER: We'll get you out of here.
SILIK: I think not. You've proven a worthy opponent, Captain. I
would've preferred to die fighting you, but I suppose I can settle for
this. (dies)
ARCHER: Trip.
(Tucker points a gun at him.)
TUCKER:
Hold it right there.
ARCHER: It's me.
TUCKER: Shut up. Drop the disguise, Silik, or I'll blow your ugly head
off.
(Archer turns slightly so Tucker can see the dead Silik.)
ARCHER: If you do,
you'll probably regret it.
TUCKER: Captain?
ARCHER: Good to see you, Commander.
TUCKER: You're alive?
ARCHER: As long as you don't pull that trigger.
TUCKER: I can't believe it.
ARCHER: The building's about to blow up.
TUCKER: Gotcha.
ARCHER: This way.
[Bridge]
T'POL: Distance?
REED: One hundred kilometres. Targeting scanner still can't get a lock.
I'm going to have to do this the old-fashioned way. Switching to visual
scanners.
T'POL: Slow us down. Two hundred kph.
REED A group of aircraft are taking off from the base north of
Manhattan. They're headed towards us.
[Outside the Weapons Compound]
(Archer and Trip come out of the building.)
CARMINE: Nicky, cover them.
ARCHER: You got to pull your people out.
CARMINE: Oh, I'm having too much fun.
ARCHER: In a few seconds, this entire area is going to be bombed.
CARMINE: Planes? Start falling back! We got to get the hell out of
here!
ALICIA: I guess we have to say good-bye all over again. It's harder the
second time.
ARCHER: I can't argue with that.
ALICIA: I want my neighbourhood back, the way it was. And my husband, I
want him home. Fix all that, okay?
ARCHER: I'll try. Thank you.
ALICIA: Yeah.
CARMINE: Hey, you're welcome.
(A squadron of planes passes overhead.)
[Bridge]
REED: German dive-bombers. Stukas. Nothing too much
to worry about. However, they were fitted with sirens to frighten the
enemy during an attack. They fire seven point nine millimetre rounds.
T'POL: Mister Reed.
REED: We're too far away. I still can't see it.
(Enterprise is being strafed by the aircraft, and they are making an
impact on what is left of the hull.)
T'POL: It appears that bullets and sirens aren't all they have.
ARCHER: Photonic torpedoes.
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
(Finally, a temporal conduit is formed.)
ALIEN: It's holding!
[Bridge]
T'POL: I'm reading a powerful energy surge inside
the facility.
ARCHER: Malcolm.
REED: One more kilometre.
(The ship sweeps down over the skyscrapers, shooting down aircraft as
it goes.)
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
(Vosk steps up in front of the conduit.)
VOSK: Destiny.
[Bridge]
REED: I can see it.
ARCHER: Take it out.
(Three torpedoes rip into the building, turning it into a ball of
flame.)
[Nazi Weapons Facility]
VOSK: No!
[Timeline flux]
(Archer is surrounded by disjointed images
disappearing and appearing - pyramids, Easter Island, American Civil
War
soldiers, Stonehenge.)
DANIELS: It's quite a sight. The timeline's resetting itself. You did
it. Vosk is dead. He didn't make it back. All of the damage he caused,
it never happened.
ARCHER: And you're here to give me a pat on the back.
DANIELS: In a way.
ARCHER: Well, I don't want it. I want you to leave me and my crew
alone. We're done with you and your damn Temporal Cold War.
DANIELS: It's coming to an end because of what you did. You have no
idea how many lives you've saved.
ARCHER: I'll take your word for it. Just send us home.
(Margaret Thatcher, someone using a laptop, the Clintons, Mandela,
Blair and Bush.)
DANIELS: It's almost ready. Good-bye, Jonathan. Captain. It's been a
privilege.
(And with an image of Archer running down the gantry before the Xindi
weapon exploded, the Bridge shimmers back into view.)
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Everyone all right?
(Nods all round.)
TRAVIS: Captain.
(The viewscreen shows a half-lit blue and white planet.)
ARCHER: We're in the right place. Let's find out if we're in the right
time. Hoshi?
HOSHI : Multiple signals. Lunar One Colony, orbital platform, San
Francisco. They're all calling in.
T'POL: I'm picking up vessels approaching. Dozens of them.
ARCHER: Do they look friendly?

  [San
Francisco - Bay Stadium]
 (A shuttlepod lands in front of a huge crowd, and
Archer with his senior staff are greeted as heroes.)
FORREST: Well done, Jonathan.
ARCHER: Thank you, Admiral.
(the applause dies down, and Archer steps to the rostrum)
ARCHER: I've been told that people are calling us heroes. When it comes
to my crew, you won't get any argument from me.
But I think it's important that we remember the heroes who aren't with
us. the twenty seven crewmen who didn't make it back. Without their
sacrifice, I wouldn't be standing here right now. None of us would. But
I'm sure I speak on behalf of my entire crew when I say it's good to be
home.
[Club]
(Archer strolls in, in civvies.)
ERIKA: Excuse me.
ARCHER: Scotch.
ERIKA: The bar's reserved for regular customers. Galactic heroes have
to sit at a table.
ARCHER: I heard about your promotion. Congratulations, Captain.
ERIKA: Thank you.
ARCHER: Cheers.
ERIKA: Cheers. So what was it like in the Expanse?
ARCHER: You'll be at the debriefing tomorrow, won't you? I wouldn't
want to spoil any surprises. Besides, I've got more important
questions. Seen any good movies while I was gone?
ERIKA: Another World War III epic. It swept all the awards. But you
haven't missed much. Earth's been holding its breath for the past year,
wondering if the Xindi were going to come back and finish the job. On
the bright side, there've been more weddings and births than ever
before.
ARCHER: I don't see a ring.
ERIKA: I'm married to Starfleet. Just like you.
[T'Pol's quarters]
(The door chimes.)
T'POL: Come in.
TUCKER: Well, it looks like you're taking enough clothes to last a
year.
T'POL: You wanted something?
TUCKER: I told the Captain I wanted to stay aboard and supervise the
refit, but he suggested I take a break. More like an order, actually.
Problem is, I'm not sure where to go. Lizzie's gone, my home town
doesn't exist anymore. Guess this is my home now.
T'POL: You could come with me.
TUCKER: To Vulcan?
T'POL: The transport leaves at eleven hundred hours.
TUCKER: Where would I stay?
T'POL: There's a guest room in my mother's home.
TUCKER: Oh, your mom's house, huh? What does she know about me? About
us?
T'POL: I've never mentioned you.
TUCKER: So you'd introduce me as?
T'POL: Commander Charles Tucker the third. You've told the Captain that
you don't get to see as many alien cultures as you'd like. You've never
been to Vulcan.
TUCKER: Eleven hundred hours, huh? I'd better start packing.
[NX02 - Columbia - Bridge]
(She is still being fitted out in Spacedock.)
ERIKA: We've tied these stations directly in the primary EPS junction.
ARCHER: I hope you don't mind if I steal some of these improvements.
ERIKA: I won't say anything if you do me a small favour. My senior
officer candidates. I'd like to get your opinion. You've served with a few of them.
(She hands over a data chip. Archer refers to the Captain's chair.)
ARCHER: You might want to talk to
someone about installing a lumbar support. You're going to spend a lot
of hours in that chair.
ERIKA: We've improved hull polarisation by twelve percent. We'll be
able to hang in a firefight a little longer.
ARCHER: Ventral and dorsal torpedo launchers, pulsed phase cannons.
ERIKA: Upgrades you recommended. What is it?
ARCHER: I had an argument once with Captain Jefferies. He was one of
the designers of the NX-Class.
ERIKA: I'm aware of that.
ARCHER: I told him I didn't want to be in command of a warship trying
to make first contact with new species. Jefferies was right. We needed
those weapons, and a hell of a lot more.
[Starfleet HQ]
(The debriefing session.)
ARCHER: The asteroids were loaded with trellium ore. We think the
Vulcans entered the field in order to mine it.
WILLIAMS: Trellium?
ARCHER: It's an alloy that protects against spatial anomalies. Ships in
the Expanse used it to insulate their hulls.
WILLIAMS: Your log reflects that when you boarded the Seleya you found
the crew in a delusional, violent state.
ARCHER: They attacked us the minute we docked. The trellium had a toxic
effect on the Vulcans. It damaged their neural pathways. They lost the
ability to suppress their emotions.
SOVAL: According to your log, the entire crew of the Seleya was killed
when you triggered a reactor breach.
ARCHER: The breach was an accident. We were trying to disable their
power grid.
SOVAL: As far as I can determine, you didn't try to save a single
Vulcan crewman.
ARCHER: There was no point. They were too far gone.
SOVAL: Is that your medical opinion, Captain?
ARCHER: Phlox made that determination.
SOVAL: Our specialists have examined the data you sent back. It's far
from certain that the neurological damage was irreversible.
ARCHER: There was nothing we could do for them.
SOVAL: T'Pol was exposed to the trellium. She recovered.
ARCHER: I couldn't help them!
SOVAL: There's no need to get emotional, Captain. You spent several
hours in the ship's auxiliary control room. In that time, did you try
to access the internal sensors, or download the computer database?
ARCHER: No.
SOVAL: So in effect, we don't know what really happened aboard the
Seleya.
ARCHER: What the hell does that mean?
SOVAL: Because of this oversight, we'll never have a complete picture
of the events that led to the ship's destruction.
ARCHER: I just told you exactly what led to the ship's destruction.
FORREST: Captain.
ARCHER: I'm not going to sit here and be accused of murdering those
people.
SOVAL: No one is accusing you of anything, Captain.
ARCHER: Maybe that crew would still be alive if you'd been a little
more helpful.
SOVAL: I beg your pardon?
ARCHER: You did everything you could to sabotage our mission. I got
more help from the Andorians than I ever got from the High Command.
FORREST: That's enough, Captain.
ARCHER: This planet would be a cloud of dust right now if we'd listened
to you.
FORREST: That's enough!
[Forrest's office]
ARCHER: How can you be taking his side?
FORREST: I am not taking anyone's side. You were out of line.
ARCHER: They don't lift a finger to help us and now I have to justify
myself to that son of a bitch?
FORREST: The debriefing's on hold, indefinitely. I want you to take
some time off to clear your head.
ARCHER: With all due respect, Admiral, I don't need a vacation.
FORREST: That's an order, Captain!
[Corridor]
(Phlox is overloaded with dufflebags and animal carry-boxes.)
PHLOX: Lieutenant. If you wouldn't mind.
(Reed takes some off him.)
REED: Not exactly travelling light, are you?
PHLOX: Thank you. Why leave the comforts of home, when you can take it
all with you?
REED: Okay. I trust you'll be taking the proper precautions on the
surface.
PHLOX: What do you mean?
REED: I'm surprised you haven't heard. An Andorian and two Rigelians
were attacked.
PHLOX: Attacked? Why?
REED: Apparently the Xindi incident has caused a degree of xenophobia.
It's hard to believe in this day and age. I'm told the Vulcans are
staying behind the walls of their compound.
PHLOX: Well, I'm not going to let a few isolated incidents disrupt my
vacation plans. I lived on Earth for many years before coming aboard
Enterprise.
REED: I don't think this is the same planet you remember, Doctor.
People are looking for someone to blame and they don't care who it is.
PHLOX: I appreciate your concern, but I'll be fine. Would you?
(Reed opens the airlock for him.)
PHLOX: Thank you.
[By a tranquil lake]
(Archer is checking a length of rope.)
ARCHER: Mind if I ask what you're doing here?
ERIKA: You know better than to go climbing without a partner.
[Vulcan - T'Pol's family home]
(The sky is red, and so is the rock as T'Pol opens
the door and they go into a courtyard with oriental overtones including
a gnarled small tree and a water feature of a giant urn with trickling
water.)
TUCKER: What about that volcano we saw on the way down, Mount Tar'ana?
T'POL: Tar'hana.
TUCKER: It still active?
T'POL: There are frequent eruptions. We can schedule a tour of the
crater, if you're interested.
TUCKER: Volcanoes, ancient ruins, fire plains. I'm not sure where to
start. So, this is where you grew up. It's not like I imagined.
T'POL: Meaning?
TUCKER: Well, it's beautiful.
T'POL: Vulcans appreciate beauty.
TUCKER: Well, I had no doubt about that. You always were a snazzy
dresser.
T'POL: Commander Tucker, I suggest
T'LES: You didn't tell me you were bringing a guest.
T'POL: Mother, you're home.
T'LES: Obviously. It's agreeable to see you. You appear well.
TUCKER: I'm Charles Tucker. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
(He manages the v-salute, and she responds.)
T'LES: (to T'Pol, in Vulcan) Why is he here?
T'POL: (in Vulcan) Commander Tucker is my colleague. He wanted to visit
Vulcan.
T'LES: (in Vulcan) This is the first time you've brought a colleague
home with you.
T'LES: You both must be very tired after your journey.
(she leads the way into the living room)
T'LES: The guest room is on the south end of the house. (Tucker leaves
them.)
T'POL: It's not yet midday. Why aren't you at the Science Academy?
T'LES: I'm no longer an instructor there. I wrote you a letter. Didn't
Starfleet transmit it to your ship?
T'POL: We had communication difficulties in the Expanse.
T'LES: I don't know why you're surprised. This was planned years ago.
There's more to life than one's profession. Perhaps you'll learn that
one day. It seems that I'm not the only one who knew you were coming.
You received this yesterday.
(She hands over a letter.)
T'POL: It's from Koss.
T'LES: Did you believe he had forgotten you? You're going to respond.
T'POL: I have nothing to say to Koss.
T'LES: He's your fiancé.
T'POL: Former fiancé.
T'LES: That is a matter for debate. It would be wise for you to speak
with him.
[Climbing a rock face]
ERIKA: You probably don't want to hear this, but I
got a call from my brother yesterday. They renamed my old high school
after you. How many is that, two, three dozen?
ARCHER: I'm not counting.
ERIKA: That's just North America. I don't think Zefram Cochrane has
that many schools named after him.
(Further on -)
ERIKA: So, did you get a chance to look 'em over?
ARCHER: Look what over?
ERIKA: My senior officer candidates. Any suggestions for Tactical?
ARCHER: You may want to find someone with more field experience, a
MACO.
ERIKA: I'm not sure how I feel about a military officer on the Bridge.
ARCHER: If I were you, I'd talk to General Casey about assigning an
entire squad.
(going up a sheer face, using pitons and ropes)
ARCHER: Things have changed since Enterprise left Spacedock. You'll
spend a lot of your time boldly going into battle.
ERIKA: Don't you think you're being a little cynical?
ARCHER: Did you read my reports?
ERIKA: Yes, Captain, I did.
(She spots a pad mark.)
ERIKA: Hey.
(Archer scans it.)
ARCHER: Mountain lion. Tracks are a few days old.
ERIKA: Good thing I have you to protect me.
[T'Pol's family home - guest room]
(It's still dark when T'Les strikes the gong in the
courtyard, and someone knocks at his door.)
TUCKER: Come in.
T'POL: Good morning.
TUCKER: What time is it?
T'POL: Oh four hundred.
TUCKER: You're kidding.
T'POL: We have to prepare the morning meal. As guests, it's expected of
us.
[T'Pol's family home - living room]
(The sun is now up, and the three are settling down
to the meal, mostly fruit by the looks of it.)
T'POL: The nar'ru vines have bloomed early this year.
T'LES: I've had ample time to attend to them.
T'POL: It sounds as if you're not enjoying retirement.
T'LES: You still haven't told me the reason for your visit.
T'POL: I didn't know one was necessary.
T'LES: I thought perhaps you'd decided to rejoin the High Command.
T'POL: I've been offered a commission with Starfleet. If I accept, it could be
several years before I'm able to return home.
T'LES: The gespar isn't fresh. My stasis unit needs to be replaced.
TUCKER: Well, I'd be happy to take a look at it. If I can recalibrate a
warp reactor, I ought to be able to handle a kitchen appliance.
T'LES: My daughter's always been fascinated by alien worlds. She was
all too eager to finish her schooling and leave Vulcan.
T'POL: As I recall, you encouraged me to leave.
T'LES: A mother is expected to push her young out of the nest. At some
point, they're supposed to return. I'm told that on Earth a human child
chooses their own path in life. They put their own wishes ahead of
their family's.
TUCKER: That's true for the most part.
T'LES: You've learned much from them, haven't you?
T'POL: A Starfleet posting is no less important than one with the High
Command. I'm sure Father would have approved.
T'LES: Your father believed that our work should enrich Vulcan society.
T'POL: Earth is supposed to be our ally.
T'LES: What's happened to you?
T'POL: We shouldn't argue in front of a guest.
[Bar]
(Reed signs an autograph for two young women.)
REED: Well, thank you, that's very kind of you to say. Unfortunately, we
can't actually give tours of the ship. If that policy ever changes, you
two will be the first to know.
TRAVIS: You had to wear that jacket.
REED: Do you think I wore this jacket to attract attention?
(It does have the Enterprise patch on the sleeve.)
MAN: How's your drink?
PHLOX: Delicious, thank you.
MAN: Because I'd heard someplace your people didn't like alcohol.
PHLOX: You may be thinking of Vulcans.
MAN: You know, you're right. I get your species mixed up all the time.
REED: Is there something we can help you with?
MAN: I'm just trying to make sure your friend here is comfortable.
Sitting in a bar full of so many strange looking aliens like us.
PHLOX: I'm quite comfortable.
MAN: Because if you weren't, if humans make you nervous for some
reason, the Vulcan Consulate's on the other side of the bridge. I'll
bet there's someplace there where someone like yourself could get a
nice, refreshing beverage.
PHLOX:: Well, perhaps we should be on our way?
REED: We're not going anywhere, Doctor.
MAN: If your friend wants to go, you should let him go.
TRAVIS: You're not chasing anyone out of here.
MAN: You Starfleet people are the real problem. You fly all around
space telling every species you meet where to find Earth. Did it ever
occur to you that might not be the smartest thing to do?
REED: Sir, Why don't you just go back to the bar?
MAN: Excuse me, Admiral. I don't take orders from you.
TRAVIS: You heard him. Step away from the table.
(The man tries to take a swing at Reed, but misses by a mile. A bar
brawl instantly ensues.)
PHLOX: Gentlemen, please!
(The man is about to hit Phlox, when the Denobulan hold his breath and
his face enlarges, with a frill around it. The combatants stare,
amazed, then they run for it.)
REED: Doctor?
[T'Pol's family home - living room]
(We see that the kitchen is part of the main area,
as T'Les comes in. Trip is fixing her stasis unit.)
TUCKER: I just want to thank you for letting me stay here.
T'LES: Expressing gratitude is an Earth custom.
TUCKER: T'Pol says thank you all the time.
(T'Les washes the vegetables she's brought.)
T'LES: I've noticed.
TUCKER: T'Pol's lucky. It's nice to have a place to go home to.
T'LES: I know that you are romantically involved with my daughter.
There's no logic in denying it. How long have you been attracted to
her?
TUCKER: I knew we had some kind of chemistry the first time we got into
an argument. I never had fun arguing with anyone before. I got the
impression T'Pol wasn't going to say anything to you.
T'LES: She didn't. I'm her mother. You've repaired it?
TUCKER: The field generator just needed a little adjustment. As good as
new.
T'LES: If you have the time, perhaps you could repair my food
synthesiser. (There's a knock at the door.) T'LES: Would you mind?
(Tucker opens the door to a male Vulcan.)
T'LES: Koss?
KOSS: I need to speak with T'Pol.
[T'Pol's family home - courtyard]
KOSS: I want to hear about your life aboard the
human ship. You must have many fascinating stories.
T'POL: Why are you here?
KOSS: The answer should be obvious.
T'POL: You've received my letters. You know I'm not interested in
marriage.
KOSS: The decision isn't ours alone. My parents believe in the old
traditions. For them, a betrothal cannot simply be dismissed.
T'POL: You have the option of choosing another mate.
KOSS: I don't want another mate.
T'POL: You should be aware I've been ill recently.
KOSS: Ill?
T'POL: It could take some time for me to recover, assuming it's even
possible.
KOSS: I can help. My father's a man of influence. I knows the finest
doctors in the province. I intend to go through with this.
T'POL: What if I declare the kal-if-fee?
KOSS: Is that what you want? A fight to the death? Perhaps your human
friend would make a suitable challenger.
T'POL: You find this amusing.
KOSS: No. Call a challenger if you wish. I'll do whatever's necessary.
T'POL: It's best if you leave.
KOSS: I may be able to help your mother.
T'POL: What do you mean?
KOSS: My father could have her reinstated.
T'POL: She retired.
KOSS: She was asked to resign.
T'POL: Why?
KOSS: I've said more than I should. If we were to marry, you'd only
have to live on Vulcan for one year. You could resume your career with
Starfleet after that.
T'POL: Is that what you want, an absent wife?
KOSS: I'd want you to be happy.
T'POL: You should go.
[Sunset in the mountains]
ARCHER: How about that?
ERIKA: What?
ARCHER: Just to the left of Polaris. We found our first M-class planet
around that star.
ERIKA: Maybe humans will go back someday, build a colony?
ARCHER: I doubt it. The air was filled with a psychotropic compound.
After breathing it for a few hours, my senior officers nearly killed
each other. Maybe the Vulcans were right. Maybe we weren't ready.
ERIKA: Not ready? How long were we supposed to wait?
ARCHER: Look what it's gotten us. We almost lost Earth.
ERIKA: Enterprise saved Earth.
ARCHER: If we weren't out there stirring up trouble, seven million
people might still be alive.
ERIKA: You weren't stirring up trouble. You were exploring.
ARCHER: I'm not sure there's much of a difference.
ERIKA: So what do you suggest? Put our starships in mothballs?
ARCHER: No, we need them. But look at the Vulcans. They're not
explorers. They keep their ships close to home. You never know who's
going to come calling.
ERIKA: That's not the mission either one of us signed up for.
ARCHER: Well, maybe you'll feel differently after you've delivered a
few dozen eulogies.
[T'Pol's family home - living room]
T'LES: It's difficult to meditate with you standing
there.
T'POL: This retirement wasn't your choice.
T'LES: That's not entirely accurate. I chose to retire rather than face
dismissal. I was under investigation by the Security Ministry. They
claimed I had taken restricted data from the Academy archives.
T'POL: Did you?
T'LES: No.
T'POL: I don't understand.
T'LES: Their accusations were fabricated. I was told that if I left the
Academy they would end the inquiry.
T'POL: Why would the Ministry do this? Because of me. They blamed me
for the incident at P'Jem.
T'LES: After the monastery was destroyed, the First Minister was
dismissed. You've made many enemies here.
T'POL: They couldn't reach me on Enterprise, so they punished you. It's
criminal. How could you let them do this?
T'LES: You've changed. Your emotions were always close to the surface,
but you managed to suppress them. It's because of this Commander
Tucker, isn't it? He's the reason why you refuse to bond with Koss. Do
you really believe that a human and a Vulcan can have a future
together? Imagine the shame your children would endure, assuming that
the two of you could have children.
T'POL: That wouldn't be your concern.
[Night in the mountains]
(The pair are in their sleeping bags, but Archer
can't sleep. The nocturnal noises prompt him to get a phase pistol from
his rucksack and go scouting. He is jumped by a pair of Xindi
reptilians who throw him off a cliff,
and he wakes up screaming.)
ERIKA: You all right?
ARCHER: I'm not even sure what all right means anymore.
ERIKA: Want to talk about it? There's an old code among climbers.
Anything that happens on the mountain stays there.
ARCHER: You want to know why I'm out here? I figured this is the last
place I'd run into anyone who'd want to shake my hand or take my
picture or tell me I'm an inspiration to their children. If they knew
what I'd done.
ERIKA: You did what any captain would have done.
ARCHER: Does that include torture? Or marooning a ship full of innocent
people? Because I don't remember reading those chapters in the
handbook.
ERIKA: Where are you going, Jon? Are you going to go climbing in the
middle of the night?
ARCHER: Why not?
ERIKA: It'd be a shame if you lost your footing. It's a long way down.
But at least you wouldn't have to deal with these feelings anymore.
ARCHER: Are you telling me I have some kind of a death wish?
ERIKA: You tell me.
All I'm trying to do is get away from you. I look at you, and I see the
person I was three years ago. The explorer that my father wanted me to
be. I lost something out there, and I don't know how to get it back.
(Erika leans over and kisses him, long and gentle.)
ARCHER: What was that?
ERIKA: Something I haven't done in a while. Whatever you lost, maybe I
could help you find it.
[Vulcan]
(T'Pol takes Tucker sightseeing to a place with lots
of giant statues.)
TUCKER: You know, if we have time when we get back to Earth, I'd like
to show you some sights, return the favour. Everything okay?
T'POL: There's something I need to tell you. I've decided to marry
Koss.
TUCKER: Marry him?
T'POL: If I join his family, my mother will regain her position at the
Academy. His father is a senior Minister with a great deal of
influence.
TUCKER: I don't get it. Are they forcing you to do this?
T'POL: The decision was mine. My mother resigned because of my actions.
TUCKER: You told me three years ago you didn't even love this guy. So
you're just going to leave Starfleet, move back to Vulcan?
T'POL: I've been negotiating with Koss's family.
TUCKER: Negotiating?
T'POL: They've agreed we won't have to reside together, not right away.
I'll remain on Enterprise for the time being.
TUCKER: That's real generous of them.
T'POL: Trip, I have to do this for many reasons.
TUCKER: And how am I supposed to take this?
T'POL: I'm sorry.
TUCKER: You're sorry. You brought me sixteen light years just to watch
you get married to someone you barely know.
[Daytime in the mountains]
ERIKA: We should have brought a camera.
ARCHER: You remember that planet I told you about? There was a mountain
range on the southern continent. The view was almost as amazing as
this.
ERIKA: That's a good day's climb we've got ahead of us. We can reach
the summit by nightfall, but we should get moving.
ARCHER: I think the view is fine from here. I'm glad you tagged along.
ERIKA: You know, there's still something I'm not quite clear about.
ARCHER: What's that?
ERIKA: Why did we stop seeing each other?
ARCHER: Well, I was your superior officer. It wasn't appropriate.
ERIKA: You're not my superior anymore. (they kiss) I wonder if
Starfleet would approve? The captains of the only two warp five ships?
ARCHER: You're forgetting the climber's code.
[Sickbay]
(In Spacedock, the external repairs to Enterprise
are almost complete.)
HOSHI: So, what's the verdict? Am I going to live?
PHLOX: Your parasite count is almost negligible. This should dispose of
the rest of them.
HOSHI: I hope you're going to make it tonight.
PHLOX: Hmm?
HOSHI: Madame Chang's. Don't tell me that you forgot.
PHLOX: My osmotic eel is under the weather. I should stay aboard until
she's feeling better.
HOSHI: Wait. No, you've been talking about the egg-drop soup at this
place for as long as I've known you.
PHLOX: I'm sure you and Ensign Mayweather will enjoy it.
HOSHI: I spoke with Travis. What happened to you the other night?
PHLOX: Oh, you must mean the, er ((holding breath gesture). Nothing
more than an instinctive defensive response.
HOSHI: So you're going to stay aboard the ship because of some
loudmouth in a bar?
PHLOX: My presence could provoke another incident. Someone could get
hurt.
HOSHI: This isn't the way to deal with prejudice. The best thing is to
show your face and remind people that there are aliens who don't want
to blow up the planet.
PHLOX: I can't blame those men for the way they reacted. Earth has
survived a horrific attack. It will take time for the trauma to heal.
Besides, I have friends to keep me company. Now, if it's not too much
trouble?
HOSHI: I'll bring you some take-out.
[Starfleet HQ]
WILLIAMS: The details of this debriefing will
remain classified, as ordered by the Command Council.
FORREST: If there are no further questions?
(Everyone rises and leaves the room, except Archer and Soval.)
ARCHER: Ambassador. I want to apologise for what I said to you the
other day. I was out of line.
SOVAL: Yes, you were.
ARCHER: I'm glad we can finally agree on something.
SOVAL: Captain. Your actions, while being morally questionable, were
necessary. I opposed your appointment as captain of Enterprise, but
it's obvious now that I was wrong. T'Pol has told me that the Expanse
would have someday encompassed hundreds of systems, including Vulcan.
You've done a great service for both our worlds. (He holds out his hand.)
SOVAL: Thank you.
(They shake.)
[T'Pol's family home - guest room]
TUCKER: Come in.
T'LES: Koss and his family are waiting.
TUCKER: I'll be there as soon as I can. Know any good tailors?
(T'Les does up his collar for him.)
T'LES: These clothes belonged to my
husband. They fit you well.
TUCKER: Aren't you bothered by the fact that T'Pol doesn't even care
for this guy?
T'LES: She's fulfilling her family obligation. I met my husband only
once before we were joined. In time, we developed a deep connection to
each other.
T'POL: Yeah. Well, maybe she'd rather make a connection with someone
else.
T'LES: Have you informed T'Pol?
TUCKER: Informed her of what?
T'LES: You're in love with her. Vulcans may not express their emotions,
but we are sensitive to them.
TUCKER: I don't think I knew it until we were standing over that lava
field and she told me she was going to marry Koss. That's when it hit
me. I was going to lose her. I wanted to tell her right there, but I
couldn't.
T'LES: There's still time.
TUCKER: I thought you didn't approve.
T'LES: I may not condone your relationship, but it's important for her
to have all the facts.
TUCKER: If I say anything, T'Pol might call off the wedding. Or worse,
not call it off. She's got enough pressure on her as it is. I don't
want to make things any more complicated.
[T'Pol's family home -  living
room]
(Koss is striking the gong to summon everyone.)

TUCKER: You look amazing.
T'POL: I'm grateful that you're here.
TUCKER: Wouldn't miss it for the world.
T'LES: It's time.
(She leads the group out into the courtyard, and T'Pol gives Tucker a
quick kiss on the cheek before going outside.)
[T'Pol's family home - courtyard]
(Koss and T'Pol kneel in front of each other and
touch two fingers together.)
PRIEST: What ye are about to witness comes down from the time of the
beginning without change. This is the Vulcan heart. This is the Vulcan
soul. This is our way.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Borderland
Borderland
 Mission date: May 17, 2154
Original Airdate: 29 Oct, 2004
  [Klingon
Bridge]
 OFFICER: A transport shuttle, no armaments.
SOLDIER: Their engines are down. Life support failing.
CAPTAIN: Crew?
SOLDIER: Two biosigns, human.
CAPTAIN: Tractor beam. Send a squad to the docking port.
(The little ship is grabbed.)
[Klingon Corridor]
(Two young men are being escorted by a group of
big, armed Klingons, when they stop and look at each other.)
SOLDIER: Move! Walk, human!
(The pair take on the Klingons, easily throwing them along the
corridor, and knocking them out.)
[Klingon Bridge]
CAPTAIN: Contact the High Council. Inform them of
the prisoners. Request instructions.
OFFICER: Commander, disruptor fire near the brig.
(The door opens, and the two young men raise their weapons.)
CAPTAIN: QI'yaH!
(The scene ends in a flash of disrupter fire.)
[Starfleet HQ - Brig]
(The cell has plenty of A4 paper with writing on,
neatly arranged on the walls, and in huge piles on the floor. A
familiar looking man in overalls is sitting at a table, writing. In
this
incarnation, he has pink skin and silver hair, not a pale face and dark hair.)
VOICE [OC]: You have a visitor.
SOONG: I'm busy.
VOICE [OC}: Stand up, Doctor. (Muttering under his breath, he puts down
his pencil and does so.) VOICE [OC]: Arms.
(The metal devices on his wrists lock themselves together to form a
chunky pair of handcuffs. The door opens.)
SOONG: Jonathan Archer. What brings you here? They're naming the prison
after you?
ARCHER: I need to ask you some questions.
SOONG: I'm kind of in the middle of something.
ARCHER: It won't take long.
SOONG: Well. I suppose it's not every day one gets to speak to the man
who saved the planet. Please. (Archer steps into the cell) I apologise
for the clutter. I'm not allowed traditional recording devices.
(The guard closes the door and steps out of sight.)
ARCHER: You programmed a PADD to unlock every security door in the
building.
SOONG: I was particularly proud of that. I made it all the way to
Sausalito. On the rare occasion I get stuck on a problem, I find a
vigorous escape attempt helps to clear the head. (Archer looks at a
paper) Go ahead. They're DNA sequences. That one is for a modification
of the human T-cell. It would render Sharat Syndrome a thing of the
past. That one increases the visual spectrum by five percent. Of
course, none of this will ever be tested. They clear out my room every
few months. I'm told it all gets vaporised.
ARCHER: Why invest so much time and energy on things no one will ever
use?
SOONG: How can a supposedly intelligent species reject technology that
would enhance ability, relieve suffering?
ARCHER: Genetic engineering has caused a lot of suffering.
SOONG: So did splitting the atom, yet the first ships to colonise the
solar system were nuclear-powered. But you're not here to discuss that.
ARCHER: Someone attacked a Klingon Bird of Prey. The entire crew was
massacred. The ship is missing.
SOONG: I read the reports. I understand the Klingons are quite annoyed.
Looks like you might've saved Earth for nothing.
ARCHER: Whoever's responsible jettisoned the Klingon crew into space.
DNA was recovered from the bodies.
SOONG: Let me guess. Human?
ARCHER: Not quite.
SOONG: I see.
ARCHER: They were Augments. Their genetically-enhanced DNA matched
embryos stolen from a medical facility over twenty years ago. Stolen by
you.
[Bridge]
(Enterprise is still in Spacedock, and the senior
staff are in casual clothes.)
ARCHER: Soong used to work at Cold Station 12, a top secret medical
research station.
REED: Isn't that where Starfleet keeps a stockpile of infectious
diseases?
ARCHER: Along with genetically-engineered embryos left over from the
Eugenics Wars. It's been kept from the public for obvious reasons.
TRAVIS: I remember Soong's trial. He wouldn't say what he did with the
embryos he stole.
ARCHER: Now he now claims that he took them to a planet in the Trialus
System and raised them. They were around ten years old when he was
captured, a decade ago.
TUCKER: So there could be a bunch of Augments from the Eugenics Wars
running around loose.
TRAVIS: Not a pretty thought.
REED: What would they want with a Klingon Bird of Prey?
ARCHER: We don't know. Neither does Soong. At least he claims he
doesn't. But he does think he can convince them to surrender without a
fight.
REED: You're bringing him along.
ARCHER: There's also the fact that he spent time in the Borderland.
HOSHI: The Borderland?
REED: The area where the Klingon ship was attacked.
T'POL: It's a volatile region between the Klingon Empire and the Orion
Syndicate. It attracts the most dangerous elements from both.
HOSHI: Sorry I asked.
ARCHER: The Klingons have threatened to retaliate with everything
they've got. We're the fastest ship and the most experienced crew. We
have to find the Augments and bring them back. It's the only way to
avert a war. We launch in six hours.
[Klingon Bridge]
PERSIS: (a brunette) We've mastered their engine
controls.
MALIK: (one of the young men who captured the ship) Wing-mounted
disruptor cannons, photon torpedo launchers. This ship's an arsenal.
PERSIS: We're finally free.
RAAKIN: A fine ship.
(Suddenly he hits Malik.)
MALIK: I thought you'd be pleased.
RAAKIN: I didn't sanction this attack. If you'd failed, they would've
come after all of us.
MALIK: I didn't fail.
RAAKIN: Their government knows what we did. They have ships hunting for
us right now.
MALIK: They won't find us. It was time for us to leave this godforsaken
planet.
RAAKIN: That was my decision, not yours! You've forgotten who I am?
Have you?!
MALIK: No, Raakin.
RAAKIN: Say it.
MALIK: You are our leader.
RAAKIN: (taking Persis' hand) Don't ever make me ask you again. Notify
me when the rest of our supplies are onboard. We're leaving orbit.
[Docking port]
(Enterprise is still in Spacedock. Soong is handcuffed and escorted by three MACOs.)
SOONG: Permission to come
aboard, sir?
ARCHER: This is my Science Officer, T'Pol.
SOONG: No need for an introduction. I admire your people very much. We
share a similar view of humanity.
T'POL: What view is that?
SOONG: That it could stand some improvement.
T'POL: I believe that's true of most species, if not all.
ARCHER: My Tactical Officer, Lieutenant Reed.
REED: Doctor.
SOONG: I've heard of you, but I don't recognise your face. You're not
getting your fair share of publicity.
REED: I think I've had all I can stand.
ARCHER: We've prepared some quarters. You'll be under guard at all
times. If you should decide you need to clear your head.
SOONG: We're on a starship soon to be at high warp. Where exactly would
I go?
ARCHER: It's this way.
(The group head off down a corridor.)
SOONG: If I could examine the DNA samples the Klingons recovered, I
could tell you something about the current state of the Augments.
ARCHER: I'll have the information sent to your quarters.
SOONG: A laboratory would be preferable, your Sickbay. Doctor Phlox's
reputation rivals my own, before I was imprisoned, of course. I'd enjoy
trading notes with him.
ARCHER: I'll consider it.
[Bridge]
(Tucker is putting the finishing touches to the new
Captain's chair when T'Pol brings him a PADD.)
TUCKER: So, how was the honeymoon?
T'POL: Honeymoon?
TUCKER: You were on Vulcan another two weeks after I left. I figured
(Archer enters.)
TUCKER: It comes with everything but its own protein resequencer. For
that, I'll need another day.
ARCHER: I like it.
TUCKER: We don't have time to go over all the details. Just try not to
hit that button.
HOSHI: We're cleared for launch.
ARCHER: Here we are again. (He looks around at his senior staff.) ARCHER: Wouldn't
have it any other way. Travis.
(Umbilicals are released, the engines glow blue, and NX01 Enterprise
glides out of her cradle - and zaps straight to warp.)
[Ready room]
ARCHER: I just received an intelligence report. A
Klingon warship was spotted near Proxima colony. Admiral Forrest thinks
they could be conducting reconnaissance for a future strike. I wanted
to keep you up to date.
T'POL: My government is trying to work out a diplomatic solution.
There's still a chance they'll be successful.
ARCHER: Small chance. One other thing. (He picks up a wooden, brass-bound
box from his desk.) ARCHER: It's your first official day of duty, Commander
T'Pol. A present. It's from the early
twentieth century.
Should help keep you pointed in the right direction. (It's a ship's
compass.) ARCHER: I'm glad you're with us.
T'POL: Thank you, Captain.
Captain's Starlog, May 17, 2154. We've crossed into
the Borderland, three light years from where the Klingons were
attacked. Still no sign of their ship.
[Sickbay]
(The DNA strands are displayed on the overhead
screen. Soon is no longer in handcuffs, but still under guard.)
SOONG: Malik. He was
the rebellious one. Reminded me of myself when I was his age. I came to
think of them as my own children.
PHLOX: It must've been difficult for you to leave them behind.
SOONG: I knew they'd survive.
PHLOX: This is extremely sophisticated work for twentieth century
Earth.
SOONG: Well, I made some modifications of my own.
PHLOX: Really? What kind of modifications?
SOONG: I prefer to let my work speak for itself.
PHLOX: I think it already has.
SOONG: I didn't realise you shared humanity's reactionary attitude
toward this field of medicine.
PHLOX: On the contrary, we've used genetic engineering on Denobula for
over two centuries, to generally positive effect.
SOONG: But you don't approve of what I've done.
PHLOX: You tried to redesign your species. The first time that was
attempted on Earth, the result was thirty million deaths.
SOONG: We can't let past mistakes hold us back.
PHLOX: It's your responsibility as a scientist to learn from past
mistakes.
SOONG: Well, what makes you think I haven't?
PHLOX: I can read.
[Bridge]
(Enterprise shakes from an impact.)
REED: Two vessels are coming up behind us.
T'POL: Orion Interceptors.
ARCHER: Interesting way of saying hello. Hoshi?
HOSHI: No response.
(Another thud. The ships drop out of warp for the shooting match.)
[Engineering]
(Things are going bang all over the place.)
TUCKER: We're getting hammered down here!
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Keep firing.
T'POL: I'm picking up an energy surge from one of the interceptors.
ARCHER: A weapon?
T'POL: No.
(Then she gets beamed away.)
[Engineering]
TUCKER: Tucker to the Bridge. Two of my people just
disappeared.
[Bridge]
REED: The interceptors have jumped to warp. They're
gone.
[Soong's quarters]
ARCHER: They took nine people, including T'Pol.
SOONG: There never used to be Orions in this area. They must've
expanded their range of operations. It's a shame. I really liked your
Science Officer.
ARCHER: How do I get them back?
SOONG: It's not going to be easy.
ARCHER: That's not what I asked you.
SOONG: They've most likely been taken to a processing station. The
nearest one's on Verex Three.
ARCHER: (into communicator) Archer to Bridge.
REED [OC]: Reed.
ARCHER: Set a course for Verex Three, best possible speed.
REED [OC]: Yes, sir.
ARCHER: What'll happen to them there?
SOONG: They'll be ushered into their new profession, as slaves. These
stations are heavily guarded. Only legitimate traders are permitted to
enter.
ARCHER: I have the feeling you've found your way in.
SOONG: I had to establish a relationship with the Orions. They helped
me acquire certain goods and equipment I needed to survive. I can get
you inside, but I can't get your people out.
ARCHER: One step at a time.
[Klingon ship - corridor]
MALIK: Raakin is taking us to another system where
we can live out our lives in peace. But I'm sure he's already told you
that.
PERSIS: He doesn't tell me everything.
MALIK: This isn't what our father would've wanted. He didn't raise us
to run away and hide.
PERSIS: Well, what do you propose?
MALIK: You could try to convince Raakin to reconsider.
PERSIS: He only wants one thing from me, and it isn't advice.
MALIK: It doesn't suit you.
PERSIS: What?
MALIK: Playing the victim. You chose Raakin. You wanted the strongest
for yourself.
PERSIS: I still do. What is it you want?
{he grabs her, and kisses her, then she pushes him up against a
bulkhead)
PERSIS: There's plenty of time for that.
[Orion Slave Market]
(T'Pol has a device fitted to her neck. When the
big green man activates it, she leaps up in pain.)
SLAVER: You are now the property of the Orion Syndicate. Break the
rules, and you will suffer. Follow the rules, and you will suffer less.
Take her.
(She is thrown into one of a number of cages filled with people of
assorted races. There is a young man in a Starfleet uniform cowering in
the corner.)
T'POL: Ensign.
PIERCE: Commander!
T'POL: Are you all right?
PIERCE: This thing, it hurts.
T'POL: Don't touch it. Have you seen anyone else from the ship?
PIERCE: Just you. Where are we?
T'POL: An Orion slave market.
PIERCE: Slave market?
T'POL: The Orions traffic in forced labour. We're being processed for
auction.
PIERCE: This can't be happening. They're going to come for us, right?
The ship?
T'POL: Ensign.
PIERCE: The Captain's going to get us out of here!
T'POL: Ensign. I don't know your name.
PIERCE: Pierce. Jeffrey Pierce. I just signed on.
T'POL: Jeffrey, Enterprise will come. It may take some time. We should
try to stay together until they get here.
[Bridge]
(Enterprise is orbiting a planet, along with a lot
of smaller craft.)
ALIEN [OC]: Transmit your identification code.
REED: Soong hasn't used this code in years.
ARCHER: Give it time.
ALIEN [OC]: You're cleared to proceed.
[Transporter alcove]
(Archer arrives in casual clothes with Soong and
his shadows, and meets Phlox, who injects Soong with something.)
ARCHER: Phlox. Transponder. It has a range of ten kilometres.
TUCKER: You wander off more than a step or two, we bring you right back
here.
SOONG: You don't like me, do you, Commander Tucker?
TUCKER: No, I don't.
SOONG: You probably blame me for what's happened to your Vulcan friend.
ARCHER: That's enough.
SOONG: Your crew could use a sense of humour. ARCHER: Make the engines a priority. When it's time to leave, I have a feeling
we're going to need all the speed we can get.
(Tucker beams Archer and Soong down to -)
[Orion Slave Market]
PIERCE: I've read every transcript of every
mission. I thought I was prepared, that I knew what to expect. Boy, was
I wrong.
T'POL: If you wish, I can teach you how to minimise your anxiety.
PIERCE: Yeah, I'd like that. I'd like that a lot.
(But the big green giant comes in and hauls her away.)
PIERCE: Leave her alone!
T'POL: Ensign, don't!
(Pierce gets a punishment zap. T'Pol is taken up to an auction block, where the green giant
effortlessly lifts her up to let the buyers have a better look.
The bidding starts, electronically. We see Tellarites in the crowd.)
SLAVER: You're doing well. (When the bidding ends, he rejoices.) SLAVER: Three
million six! Not even my last wife sold for that much.
(By the slave cages, Archer and Soong are scanning for human biosigns.)
ORION: Stand up. Bring that woman.
ARCHER: Over here.
(A dark-haired woman stands, but Archer gestures and she quietly sits
down again.)
SOONG: At least we know four of your people are still here. Doesn't
seem to be much demand for humans.
ARCHER: Those devices on their necks.
SOONG: Neurolytic restraints. Ingenious, really. They induce convulsive
seizures in disobedient slaves. If a slave attempts to leave the
premises.
ARCHER: So if we try to beam them out?
SOONG: Wouldn't recommend it, not if you want them alive.
(They've found their way to the auction block, where an Orion woman is
presenting herself for sale, unabashed.)
ARCHER: They sell their own people?
SOONG: Only the women. Orion females are known for their extreme
appetites, their innate skills.
ARCHER: Come on.
(They head off to the cages of sold slaves.)
ARCHER: T'Pol. You all right?
T'POL: How many were taken?
ARCHER: Nine. We've located five, so far. We're working on a way to try
and
ORION: She's sold. Buyers are over there.
SOONG: We made a wrong turn. Thank you so much, though. Thank you for
your help. Really, thank you. Let's go.
[Klingon ship]
(The alpha male and his woman are marching through
the ship.)
RAAKIN: He argues with every command I give, defies me in front of the
others.
PERSIS: Some of them agree with what he did, taking this ship.
RAAKIN: They've forgotten how we've stayed alive all these years. My
resolve was what kept us from starving to death on that rock.
PERSIS: They believe it's Malik who liberated us from that rock.
RAAKIN: You agree with them.
PERSIS: How can you say that?
RAAKIN: I hear it in your voice.
[Raakin's quarters]
PERSIS: Malik's doing more than arguing with your
commands. He's plotting against you. He wants to take your place.
RAAKIN: How do you know that?
PERSIS: He told me. Malik's always wanted me. I knew he was planning
something, so I let him think I wanted him as well. He said that you're
weak, that you're making all of us weak, that you're betraying Father's
principles, that if Father were here, he'd choose Malik to lead us.
RAAKIN: I will betray Father's principles. I'm going to kill my own
brother.
[Orion Slave Market]
(The slaver hauls Pierce out of the cell and onto
the auction block.)
SLAVER: If you don't sell as a slave, I will sell you as food.
(But there's not a lot of interest, and there aren't many symbols on
the price board behind him. The Slaver pushes him down the steps again.)
SLAVER: Oh, that's barely enough to
cover the expense of processing you.
ARCHER: (into communicator) Archer to Enterprise.
TUCKER [OC]: Tucker here.
ARCHER: We've located everyone, including T'Pol. I'm going to need six
kilos of tritanium cobalt.
SOONG: Nine.
[Bridge]
ARCHER [OC]: Make that nine.
TUCKER: That's half our supply.
[Orion Slave Market]
ARCHER: I'll explain later. Just get it ready.
TUCKER [OC]: Yes, sir.
[Sickbay]
[Pierce is on a biobed, restraint in place, as
Phlox tries to remove it.)
ARCHER: They normally remove the restraint after a sale. We used the
extra tritanium to bribe one of the guards to deactivate it but leave
it on him.
TUCKER: Why can't we just buy the rest of our people?
ARCHER: T'Pol's already been sold. We don't have time to try and buy
them all.
PHLOX: We're almost there. Try to hold still.
TUCKER: What kind of people are these?
SOONG: I'd say they're not unlike some of your ancestors, judging from
your accent.
TUCKER: Well, if I remember my history, these Augments you love so much
had plenty of slaves.
SOONG: They were more like subjects.
TUCKER: Oh. They were just treated like slaves.
(Phlox removes the restraint from Pierce's neck, and Archer hands it to
Tucker.)
ARCHER: T'Pol could be shipped out any second. Work fast.
[Klingon ship]
(A clandestine meeting is taking place.)
PERSIS: I told him everything. He thinks you're planning an attack
against him.
MALIK: Is he going to move against me?
RAAKIN: (with a disruptor rifle) See for yourself. Is this the move you
expected? (Malik looks at Persis.) RAAKIN: It's between us. I saved your life
once when we were children, pulled you from the river when you fell in.
MALIK: I remember.
RAAKIN: Now, ten years later, you're plotting against me.
MALIK: I'm the strongest and the smartest.
RAAKIN: Doesn't look that way from here. You would never have trapped
me like this.
(But the gun doesn't fire when he pulls the trigger.)
MALIK: But I have.
(Malik's supporters arrive.)
PERSIS: I'm sorry, Raakin.
MALIK: It's between us.
RAAKIN: Saul, Jaya, listen to me.
MALIK: They only listen to me now. There was a time when I looked up to
you, when I called you my brother.
RAAKIN: I am your brother.
MALIK: When you rejected our father's wishes, you stopped being one of
us, and when that happened, you ceased to exist. (He stabs Raakin in
the stomach.) MALIK: Which makes this an act of mercy. Get rid of him. (Persis
is starting to cry.) MALIK: Don't. Not for him.
[Orion Slave Market]
(Just outside the main area.)
TUCKER [OC]: We're sending the code now.
ARCHER: Got it.
(He distracts a guard so Soong can inject him with something. It takes
a few sways, but the giant finally topples onto his back. They're seen
by someone though, as Soong goes to the control panels and starts
working with the code. In the main market, the Slaver and her Tellarite purchaser comes for
T'Pol.)
SLAVER: Outside. Outside!
(The alien who spotted them tells another guard, but inside, T'Pol has
felt her restraint switch off, so she hits the Tellarite and all the
prisoners see the Slaver's control fail to bring her to her knees in
agony.)
PRISONER: The restraints are off!
(They make a break for it.)
SLAVER: Slaves are loose! Slaves are loose!
(The alarms go off, slaves get out of the cages and run for it. Some
encounter Orions with pain sticks.)
ARCHER: Trip, start beaming them, five at a time.
(Soong knocks him down with an Orion pain stick too.)
SOONG: Sorry, Captain. I hope you find your people. Thanks for the
ride. (The Slaver has his hand around T'Pol's neck.)
SLAVER: You've got spirit. I might
just keep you for myself.
(But she frees herself with a well aimed kick to a sensitive area.)
T'POL: I'm not for sale.
(She's beamed away.)
ARCHER: Trip, have you got everyone?
[Bridge]
TUCKER: You and Soong are the only ones left.
ARCHER [OC]: Soong got away.
[Orion Slave Market]
ARCHER: Locate him and beam him up.
(Soong uses the Orion pain stick directly against where the transponder
was injected.)
[Bridge]
TUCKER: Soong's transponder signal, it's dead.
[Orion Slave Market]
ARCHER: Can you scan for his biosign?
[Bridge]
TUCKER: We're trying, but there's too many people
down there.
[Orion Slave Market]
(Archer climbs up on the auction block for a better
view, and spots Soong trying to get away. He gets close enough to him
to activate the magnetic handcuffs.)
ALIEN: Help me. Don't let them take me.
(Soong runs into what looks like a dead end and tries climbing, so when
Archer arrives, he just disengages his handcuffs to make him fall.)
ARCHER: Trip, two to beam up.
[Brig]
(Archer is pacing up and down outside, furious.)
ARCHER: You knew exactly where the Orions were operating. You knew
they'd abduct members of my crew. Maybe you were even hoping they'd get
you.
SOONG: There was an outside chance.
ARCHER: You were determined to escape, no matter who got hurt.
SOONG: No one was injured.
ARCHER: Nine of my people were nearly sold into slavery. Two of them
may have permanent physical damage because of the restraints.
SOONG: I didn't take this action lightly.
ARCHER: Is that supposed to justify what you did?
SOONG: I'm simply saying it wasn't easy for me to place you and your
crew in jeopardy. I respect you, Captain.
ARCHER: Then tell me how to find the Augments. You know where they're
going.
SOONG: They didn't steal a Klingon ship to go sightseeing.
ARCHER: They're dangerous.
SOONG: They're the future. They're stronger, smarter, free from
sickness, with life spans twice as long as our own. You, more than
anyone, should appreciate what this means.
ARCHER: Why me?
SOONG: Your father suffered from Clarke's Disease. His final years were
marked with extreme pain.
ARCHER: My father has nothing to do with this.
SOONG: He didn't need to suffer. Genetic engineering could've cured
him. Those who want to suppress my Augments are the same ones who
condemned your father to death. Turn the ship around, Captain. Go home.
Leave them alone.
ARCHER: I'm going to find them, Doctor, whether you help me or not.
[Sickbay]
(A somewhat crowded area, with seven patients lying
on beds, and one sitting up reading a PADD.)
TUCKER: You're supposed to be resting.
T'POL: Doctor Phlox says I can resume my duties this afternoon.
TUCKER: I'm glad they got that thing off with no problem.
T'POL: There's a slight ringing in my left ear, but it should dissipate
over time.
TUCKER: Good. Well, I'll let you get back to that.
T'POL: Vulcans don't have honeymoons. After the ceremony, I went to
Mount Seleya to meditate alone.
TUCKER: It's none of my business, anyway.
(Suddenly, the ship is hit and things go bang.)
[Bridge]
REED: Orion Interceptors, two of them. Coming up
fast.
HOSHI: They're hailing us.
ARCHER: This is Captain Archer of the Starship
SLAVER [OC]: You've stolen our property!
ARCHER: They were members of my crew. You kidnapped them.
SLAVER [OC]: Disengage your warp drive, and deactivate your weapons.
ARCHER: That isn't going to happen. (another bang) Malcolm.
(The ships exchange phaser fire.)
REED: They're targeting our nacelles.
TRAVIS: We're dropping out of warp.
ARCHER: Torpedoes.
(Reed's console explodes in flames)
TRAVIS: There's another ship.
(The Bird of Prey blasts one Interceptor to pieces.)
REED: The second Orion is veering off. They're retreating.
HOSHI: The Klingons are requesting to dock.
[Ready room]
(Reed and a MACO are also present.)
MALIK: I know he's on this ship. We received his signal.
ARCHER: When he tried to escape, I saw him access a console.
MALIK: You were expecting us. Where is he?
ARCHER: In the Brig.
MALIK: In a prison cell? I want to speak with him.
ARCHER: I can't allow that.
MALIK: We saved your ship.
ARCHER: My ship wouldn't have been in danger if we hadn't come looking
for you.
MALIK: What is it you want with us?
ARCHER: My orders are to take you back to Earth.
MALIK: Earth considers my father a criminal. Why? Because he brought us
to life. You want to take us back to a world that opposes our very
existence.
ARCHER: You attacked a Klingon vessel. They're threatening war.
MALIK: That's not our problem. We don't care what happens to you.
Humanity is no longer relevant. To quote one of your philosophers,
Nietzsche, mankind is something to be surpassed.
ARCHER: You think he was talking about you?
MALIK: I'm about to attack you. (Malik grabs Archer, turning him into a
human shield before Reed and the MACO can draw their weapons.) MALIK: You see?
Even with a warning, you're not fast enough.
REED: Let him go.
We have five times your strength, double your intelligence.
REED: Let him go.
MALIK: I'll tear out his throat. Lower your weapons. Now.
(They do, and Malik speaks into him communicator.)
MALIK: Persis.
[Klingon ship]
PERSIS: I've broken their security code. We're
ready.(The airlock door opens and the MACOs there are quickly
overwhelmed by the Augments.)
[Bridge]
(Malik is still using Archer as a shield.) MALIK: I'll kill
him.
(They go into the turbolift.)
[Brig]
(The three MACO guards are quickly taken out, then
the cell doors are simply pushed open.)
PERSIS: Persis.
SOONG: Persis? (they embrace) I can't believe it.
[by the Airlock]
PERSIS: Father, here's Malik.
SOONG: Malik. (Archer gets thrown away against the bulkhead so the pair
can embrace.) SOONG: I knew we'd see each other again. I'm proud of you. Of all
of you.
ARCHER: Soong, listen to me.
SOONG: There's nothing to say, Captain.
MALIK: What should we do with them?
SOONG: Let them go.
MALIK: But they'll just come after us.
SOONG: Their ship's disabled. By the time it's repaired, we'll be far
away. It's been a pleasure, Captain. Take my advice. Go home and start
learning how to speak Klingon.
[Klingon Bridge]
(Now at warp, Soong gets to meet the other
Augments.)
SOONG: There were times back on Earth when I doubted myself, my work.
But seeing you all, I know that everything I've fought for was worth
it. We're going to build a new world. But we can't begin that task just
yet. Thousands of your brothers and sisters are waiting to be born.
Let's go get them.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Cold Station 12
Cold
Station 12
 Original Airdate: 5 Nov, 2004
  ARCHER
[OC]: Previously, on Enterprise
SOONG [Starfleet HQ - Cell]:
Jonathan Archer. What brings you here?
ARCHER: Someone attacked a Klingon bird-of-prey. The entire crew was
massacred, the ship's missing. They were Augments.
MALIK [Klingon ship]: When
you rejected our father's wishes, you stopped being one of us, Raakin.
(kills him)
ARCHER [Brig]:
They're dangerous.
SOONG: They're the future.
(The Augments storm Enterprise.)
PERSIS: Father.
SOONG [Klingon Bridge]:
Thousands of your brothers and sisters are waiting to be born. Let's go
get them.
Eleven years earlier
[Trialis]
(The young children are getting a history lesson
from their 'Father'.)
SOONG: (with only a little silver hair) Some claim humanity rose up
against the Augments. Others say the Augments began fighting among
themselves. Whoever started it, the war devastated Earth. Millions
perished. And when it was over people like you were feared. Humans will
always fear you. They fear your power, your intellect. They fear you
because you're everything they want to be, but can't be. Which is why I
brought you here, where it's safe. I've raised you like my own. You
call me Father. But I'm only watching over you. You belong to the
future, and someday you will fulfill humanity's promise.
(A pretty blond boy raises his arm.)
SOONG: Malik.
MALIK: Are there others like us?
SOONG: Many others, waiting, asleep. And someday, it'll be your duty to
wake them, set them free.
Back to the present
[Klingon Bridge]
(There's a schematic of a space station on a wall
monitor.)
SOONG: We'll have to reach this sublevel. Security personnel are
located here and here.
MALIK: A direct hit to this power conduit would demolish their life
support systems. All we'd have to do is wait a couple of hours.
SOONG: No.
MALIK: But we could walk in unopposed.
SOONG: We're not going there to take lives.
MALIK: But what if they don't give us a choice?
SOONG: No one is to be killed. Is that understood? (everyone else nods)
Malik?
MALIK: Yes. Understood, Father.
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Doctor Soong and
his Augments have escaped on a Klingon bird-of-prey. Without any other
leads, we've proceeded to the co-ordinates Soong gave us when we began
this mission.
[Trialis]
(The shuttlepod lands by the living areas. They are
dark, cold, abandoned, and the away team are using flashlights.)
TUCKER: Protein resequencer. Water purifier.
ARCHER: Everything you'd need to keep a small colony of humans alive.
Looks like this place doubled as a classroom.
REED: Imagine having Soong as your teacher.
TUCKER: (getting power back on) With that and their screwed up genes,
it's no wonder they turned out the way they did.
(Reed and the MACOs go exploring, while Archer finds some interesting
equipment)
ARCHER: Trip?
TUCKER: Interfaces. They look a lot like the ones we have in our
Sickbay. I'd say they took medical equipment with them.
ARCHER: I need to know exactly what kind. It's important.
TUCKER: I'll see what I can find out.
REED: We'll check out the rest of this place.
(Archer finds video files of Soong with the children at a birthday
party)
ARCHER: I'll be damned.
(Malcolm and the MACOs explore some passageways cut into the rock, when
a young man tries to avoid them.)
REED: Hold it!
(The lad runs into the main room.)
REED: Captain!
SMIKE: Leave me alone.
ARCHER: We're not going to hurt you.
SMIKE: Get out of my way.
ARCHER: We just want to talk. Malcolm.
(Reed lowers his phase pistol.)
ARCHER: See? We're friends.
SMIKE: Who are you?
ARCHER: I'm Captain Jonathan Archer. We're from Earth.
(Smike tries to attack him with a knife, but is easily disarmed and
knocked out.)
[Klingon ship]
SOONG: This was Raakin's. I gave it to him when he
was five. He was a good student. He loved astronomy. We'd sit at night,
and I'd point out the stars. He could name every one. Where's your
brother, Malik?
MALIK: I don't know what you've been told.
SOONG: No one will say anything. I only know he's not here.
MALIK: He's dead.
SOONG: Tell me what happened.
MALIK: He turned his back on your word. He didn't want to liberate the
others.
SOONG: What happened to him?
MALIK: I killed him. We were arguing. He pulled out a knife. I drew
mine, he came at me. The next thing I remember there was blood
everywhere. (crying) It was an accident. I tried to save him, I tried.
(Soong slams him up against the bulkhead.)
SOONG:  He was your brother!
MALIK: I'm sorry. Father. I didn't mean to hurt him, I'm sorry.
SOONG: Malik, it's my fault. I left you alone.
MALIK: No.
SOONG: I should have stayed with you. You were just children.
MALIK: No, Father.
SOONG: Shh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Malik. I'm sorry.
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: He's dehydrated, suffering from slight
malnutrition, but otherwise, he's in good condition.
ARCHER: For an Augment, he didn't put up much of a fight.
PHLOX: He isn't an Augment. He's an anomaly. His DNA is similar to the
others, but not identical. He was born with none of their enhanced
abilities.
(He pulls the curtain aside and goes in to see the young man.)
ARCHER: How's the jaw?
SMIKE: It hurts.
ARCHER: I'm sorry about that, but you didn't give me much choice. I
told you my name.
SMIKE: My real name's Udar, but my brothers and sisters call me Smike.
ARCHER: That's an unusual nickname.
SMIKE: It's from Nicholas Nickleby.
ARCHER: His handicapped friend. Is that why you were left behind?
Because you're different?
SMIKE: I would've slowed them down.
ARCHER: Udar.
SMIKE: Smike.
ARCHER: I need to find out where they went, the others.
SMIKE: I'm not telling you anything.
ARCHER: I'm trying to help them.
SMIKE: You're from Earth. You don't want to help them, you want to kill
them.
ARCHER: That's not true.
SMIKE: I won't betray my brothers and sisters.
ARCHER: Your brothers and sisters are in danger. They attacked a
Klingon ship. If the Klingons find them before we do.
SMIKE: Then more Klingons will die. You'll never stop them, Captain. No
one will.
TUCKER [OC]: Tucker to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead, Trip.
[Trialis]
TUCKER: The missing equipment? They were
incubators.
[Sickbay]
TUCKER [OC]: Artificial wombs.
[Klingon ship - Malik's quarters]
(Malik and Persis are in bed together.)
MALIK: He's different than I remember.
PERSIS: How?
MALIK: The man who raised us would never risk our lives to protect a
human.
PERSIS: He knows the station. He used to work there. He knows what he's
doing.
MALIK: We'll find out.
PERSIS: You shouldn't doubt him.
MALIK: Why not?
PERSIS: He's our father.
MALIK: He's human.
PERSIS: He's not like other humans.
MALIK: I used to believe that.
PERSIS: You were leading us before, and now he is. You can't accept
that.
MALIK: Why shouldn't I lead? Augments should be led by Augments.
PERSIS: I won't listen to this.
(Malik grabs her.)
PERSIS: Let me go.
MALIK: Don't be angry with me. I'm just thinking out loud.
PERSIS: I don't like what you're thinking.
MALIK: Then I'll stop. Stay with me.
[Situation room]
ARCHER: I think Soong is headed to Cold Station
Twelve.
TUCKER: Isn't that where he used to work?
T'POL: It's a medical facility run by Starfleet and the Denobulans.
Highly virulent diseases are stockpiled there for research purposes.
ARCHER: It's the embryos from the Eugenics Wars that Soong's after.
TUCKER: I thought Soong stole the embryos.
ARCHER: He took nineteen, but there are over eighteen hundred more.
TUCKER: That's why he took the incubators with him.
T'POL: Why weren't these embryos destroyed after the war?
ARCHER: At the time, it was too controversial. Earth's governments
couldn't decide how to handle the issue, so they put them into cold
storage. I just got off with Admiral Forrest. We've been authorised to
use whatever force necessary to stop Soong. I need all the speed you
can give me.
TUCKER: You'll have it.
[Denobulan ship]
VOICE [OC]: This is cargo ship Corsair. Repeat,
medical emergency. Situation is critical.
PILOT: (a female, as it happens) Corsair, this is Barzai, a Denobulan
medical ship. What's the nature of your emergency?
VOICE [OC]: Reactor leak. Ten crewmen exposed to delta radiation.
PILOT: I have a fix. I'm about six minutes away from you.
(But when she arrives, the big Klingon ship puts a tractor beam on her
little vessel.)
[Klingon Bridge]
SOONG: Barzai, stand down and prepare to be
boarded.
[Sickbay]
ARCHER: How's the patient?
PHLOX: He's doing fine. Ready to be discharged.
ARCHER: Good. I just reviewed the crew manifest for C-12. One of the
names is Doctor Jeremy Lucas. He's Senior Medical Director.
PHLOX: In his last correspondence, he mentioned he was being
transferred. He didn't say where.
ARCHER: I thought you should know.
PHLOX: I appreciate it. Captain, I spent a few months at C-12 myself. I
know the security protocols, I'm familiar with the technology. I'd like
to be included in the landing party.
ARCHER: Consider it done.
PHLOX: Thank you.
ARCHER: Phlox tells me he's ready to free up this biobed.
SMIKE: So I've been told.
ARCHER: If you've had enough Sickbay food, I'd like you to join me in
the Captain's Mess.
SMIKE: Do I have a choice?
ARCHER: No. See you in an hour.
[Denobulan ship]
(The group arrive at an asteroid. The Denobulan
Pilot is out cold on the floor.)
PERSIS: Cold Station Twelve, this is medical ship Barzai, transmitting
security code.
SECURITY [OC]: Barzai, we are currently on heightened alert. Slow to
one-quarter impulse and transmit security code.
PERSIS: Transmitting.
SECURITY [OC]: Code confirmed. You're clear to proceed.
(The space doors in a crater open, and the shuttle descends into the
asteroid.)
[Cold Station 12]
(Persis is stopped by a Starfleet security guard.)
GUARD: Why are you flying a Denobulan shuttle?
PERSIS: Why not?
GUARD: You aren't Denobulan.
(She takes out him and his companion, very viciously.)
PERSIS: That's true.
(Soong and the others arrive. He opens a door, goes over to a panel and
initiates Protocol 047.)
PERSIS: (with an oxygen mask) We don't have enough masks.
SOONG: You don't need masks.
[Station Control Hub]
DEPUTY: Doctor Lucas.
LUCAS: I asked you never to bother me when I'm watching a viropathic
cytolysis.
DEPUTY: Our defence protocols just came on.
LUCAS: Did you contact Security?
DEPUTY: I can't reach them. The comm.'s down.
LUCAS: (trying himself) The system's been taken offline.
(Gas starts coming in through a ceiling vent.)
DEPUTY: Doctor.
LUCAS: What the hell? ?
(They start coughing, but before he passes out, Lucas manages to
trigger a Code Black Security Alert.)
[Captain's mess]
(Smike follows Archer's lead when it comes to using
cutlery.)
ARCHER: Phlox tells me you'd been living on your own for quite a while.
SMIKE: I left the camp about a year ago.
ARCHER: You must be pretty resourceful to survive by yourself out there.
SMIKE: It wasn't that hard.
ARCHER: Didn't look like a very friendly planet. When you get back to
Earth, you should consider going to school.
SMIKE: School?
ARCHER: You've got a lot of catching up to do.
SMIKE: How can I go to school if I'm in prison?
ARCHER: What makes you think you're going to prison?
SMIKE: I'm an Augment.
ARCHER: I don't know what you've been told about Earth. You're not
going to be punished.
SMIKE: That's not what my father said.
ARCHER: Soong is not your father.
SMIKE: What do you mean?
ARCHER: (fetching a PADD) Your biological father was Miklos Karlovassi.
He was a geophysicist.
SMIKE: How do you know that?
ARCHER: We got the information from Soong's computer. Your mother's
name was Irina. She was an athlete, decathlon. Won a silver medal in the
Olympics. We've got a lot of historical data on both your parents.
You're welcome to look at it.
(Smike picks up the PADD and goes through the contents.)
[Mess hall]
(Phlox is sitting, slouched, in front of a table
laden with food.)
ARCHER: (to drinks dispenser) Coffee.
PHLOX: I'm approaching a new sleep cycle.
ARCHER: When does your hibernation begin?
PHLOX: Not for another few weeks, but I would like to increase my body
mass by at least ten percent. To tell you the truth, I'm not very
hungry.
ARCHER: You're worried about Doctor Lucas?
PHLOX: We've been friends a very long time.
ARCHER: We're getting there as fast as we can, Phlox.
PHLOX: You might be interested to know Smike's become quite the student
of Earth history. He's been reading up on the Eugenics Wars.
ARCHER: I doubt Soong gave him the whole story.
PHLOX: I'm quite familiar with the subject myself. Human intellect and
human instinct were out of sync. So many people were killed.
ARCHER: The official number was thirty million. Some historians say it
was closer to thirty five.
PHLOX: I can understand why Earth banned genetic engineering.
ARCHER: (sitting) What do you know about Clarke's syndrome?
PHLOX: It's a degenerative brain disorder that afflicts humans.
ARCHER: My father died of it when I was twelve.
PHLOX: I'm sorry.
ARCHER: He had frequent pain, hallucinations, he talked to people who
weren't there. Often couldn't recognise me or my mother. The last two
years of his life
PHLOX: And you were thinking if genetic engineering had been permitted
ARCHER: Maybe Soong has a point.
PHLOX: I've had time to examine his work more closely. I'm forced to
admit some of it is extremely inventive. He's really quite brilliant.
It's a shame such a man has to remain incarcerated.
ARCHER: He broke the law. That's why he was in prison. And that's why
I'm going to make sure he goes back. Denobula perfected genetic
engineering a long time ago, but you never came close to destroying
yourselves.
PHLOX: Perhaps we were simply fortunate.
ARCHER: Or maybe your instincts had caught up with your intellect.
Food's getting cold.
[Station Control Hub]
LUCAS: I don't have the code.
SOONG: When I was Senior Medical Director, I had access to those
embryos.
LUCAS: They changed the policy after what you did. The access code can
only be obtained through Starfleet Command.
MALIK: He's lying.
LUCAS: I'm telling the truth.
SOONG: Do the lights in your office flicker every now and then?
LUCAS: Every two hours. Drives me crazy.
SOONG: Faulty power relay. You wouldn't believe how many times I asked
them to fix it. Ten years later, they still haven't done a thing. Put
him with the others.
MALIK: Father.
SOONG: I believe him.
(He goes to another young man at a circular console.)
SOONG: Tell me.
LOKESH: It's a hexadecimal password. I'm creating an algorithm to
compute the possible combinations, a few hundred thousand of them. It
may take a few minutes.
SOONG: I can't believe I held you back in math.
(An alarm goes off.)
LOKESH: A ship's entering the system.
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: Range twenty million kilometers.
ARCHER: Any sign of the bird-of-prey?
T'POL: None. It could be hiding behind any one of the larger asteroids.
HOSHI: We're being hailed.
ARCHER: Put it up.
SOONG [on viewscreen]: Captain. I wish I could say it's been a long
time.
ARCHER: This only ends one way, Doctor.
SOONG [on viewscreen]: I think you've underestimated the variables,
about eleven of them.
(he moves to one side to reveal the station staff in an isolation
chamber)
SOONG [on viewscreen]: No one will be harmed if you leave this system
immediately.
ARCHER: I'm betting you're not a cold-blooded killer.
[Station Control Hub]
SOONG: Turn your ship around. Now.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: I want proof that the hostages are
unharmed. Let me speak to Lucas.
(Doctor Lucas is let out of the chamber, and help securely by Malik and
Saul.)
SOONG [OC]: Go ahead.
LUCAS: We're all right. No one's been hurt.
SOONG [on viewscreen]: (reappears holding a weapon) That's about to
change. You're still approaching this station.
[Station Control Hub]
SOONG: Do you have any idea what a Klingon
disruptor will do to a human skull at this range?
[Bridge]
SOONG [on viewscreen]: You're going to leave me
with an awful mess to clean up.
ARCHER: Doctor.
[Station Control Hub]
SOONG: Conversation's over. He dies.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: All stop.
[Station Control Hub]
SOONG: Now turn around.
ARCHER: Bring us about.
SOONG [on viewscreen]: That's a good captain.
(Ends transmission.)
[Station Control Hub]
LOKESH: There's another layer of encryption. It
appears to be on a quantum level.
SOONG: How long?
LOKESH: Longer than I thought, maybe a lot longer.
SOONG: Keep working.
MALIK: He lied. Doctor Lucas, about the embryos. Station access log.
SOONG: Get him in here.
[Transporter alcove]
(Two MACOs, Reed and Phlox are amongst those
reporting for away team duty.)
TUCKER: I've modulated the transporter frequency to match the station's
containment field. If you register at all on their sensors, it'll look
like a field echo.
SMIKE: Do you really think I can help?
ARCHER: If I didn't, I wouldn't have asked you to come along.
REED: Captain. We're nearly out of transporter range.
ARCHER: Energise.
[Station Control Hub]
(Doctor Lucas is tied to a chair while Malik
questions him the old-fashioned way, with his fists.)
SOONG: Malik. Malik! I want to put an end to this, Doctor.
LUCAS: So do I.
SOONG: We know you can get to the embryos. You accessed the stasis
chamber just last week.
LUCAS: That's a mistake in the log.
SOONG: I implore you. Give us what we came for, and we'll leave you in
peace.
(Lucas turns his head and mutters something, so Soong leans in to hear
better.)
SOONG: What's that?
(Let's guess what was whispered in his ear.)
SOONG: That language is unbecoming of a man of science.
MALIK: Father.
(They move to where Lucas can't hear them.)
MALIK: Some men are braver with their own lives than they are with the
lives of others.
SOONG: Bring in one of his colleagues.
MALIK: No, not here. In there.
(An isolation tube just big enough for one person.)
MALIK: There are thousands of pathogens stored here. Some kill within
minutes.
SOONG: No.
MALIK: The longer we're in this facility, the greater the chance that
more ships will come and they might not back down like Enterprise.
SOONG: It isn't necessary.
MALIK: It's the only way to make him talk. Is one human being worth all
our lives and everything you've worked for?
[Station corridor]
(The away team are safely in the station, and it
takes them three shots to fell one Augment standing guard.)
REED: If that's what it takes to stun them, what have you got to do to
kill them?
[Station Control Hub]
(Malik hauls the Station's Deputy Director into the
tube.)
SOONG: (to Lucas) Are you familiar with Symbalene blood burn? The
vascular lining literally boils away.
LUCAS: You son of a bitch.
SOONG: Actually, Mother was a chemist.
LUCAS: You can't do this.
SOONG: Believe me, I don't want to, but I'm out of options, Doctor. The
code! This is on your conscience, then, not mine.
(Gas enters the chamber, and the poor man starts coughing blood almost
immediately.)
[Station Life Support]
(Phlox uses his phase pistol to cut away a piece of
bulkhead.)
PHLOX: Life support runs through this relay.
ARCHER: How long before they run out of air in the control hub?
PHLOX: Half an hour. They should start feeling the effects within ten,
fifteen minutes.
REED: We're not talking about normal human beings here.
PHLOX: Even an Augment needs oxygen.
[Station Control Hub]
SOONG: His temperature's rising quickly. Blood
pressure's approaching critical. There's still time, Doctor.
(Lokesh signals to Malik and Persis.)
SOONG: Just say the word, I'll release the antipathogen.
LOKESH: There's fluctuation in the life support relay on level four.
MALIK: (to Persis) Go.
SOONG: Right about now, his extremities feel like they're on fire. But
it's the capillaries, starting to burst. Watch.
DEPUTY: Please! Let me out!
SOONG: I'm asking you, one doctor to another. Stop this.
LUCAS: I can't.
SOONG: Is it worth this man's life?
LUCAS: I have orders.
SOONG: I can save him! How can you let this happen?
LUCAS: How can you?
SOONG: Tell me the code! The code!
LUCAS: Go to hell!
SOONG: Release the antipathogen.
MALIK: Father?
SOONG: Do it!
MALIK: No!
(Soong pushes him aside and does it himself, but it's too late.)
[Station Life Support]
PHLOX: That should do it.
ARCHER: Smike?
SMIKE: Doctor Phlox missed something when he examined me, Captain. I do
have one enhanced ability. I can hear like they do. They're coming.
(A MACO gets shot.)
PERSIS: He's wrong, Captain. We're already here.
[Bridge]
HOSHI: There was a spike. Then the signal was gone.
TUCKER: (at T'Pol's station) Sounds like what happens when a
communicator goes down.
T'POL: To prevent us from getting a transporter fix.
TUCKER: They've been captured.
T'POL: It's a logical conclusion.
TUCKER: We have to make sure.
T'POL: Agreed.
[Station Control Hub]
(The captives are brought in. Phlox heads straight
for his friend. Saul stops him, but Soong nods.)
PHLOX: Jeremy.
LUCAS: Phlox. What are you doing here?
PHLOX: Don't move.
LUCAS: It's good to see you again.
SOONG: Am I going to spend the rest of my life trying to get rid of you?
ARCHER: You're going to spend the rest of your life in prison.
SOONG: Udar?
SMIKE: Father.
SOONG: How is this (they embrace) They told me you were dead, that you
were sick.
ARCHER: They lied to you.
MALIK: It was Raakin's order.
SOONG: What was?
MALIK: Banishment.
SOONG: Why?
MALIK: He wasn't strong enough.
SOONG: You all went along with this?
ARCHER: Why are you so surprised? Whenever a group of people start
believing they're better than everyone else the results are always the
same.
SOONG: I don't need a history lesson from you.
ARCHER: You need it from someone.
(An alarm sounds.)
LOKESH: It's Enterprise.
[Bridge]
SOONG [OC]: We have your people. I asked you not to
interfere.
[Station Control Hub]
SOONG: Now,
ARCHER: T'Pol! Execute your orders!
[Bridge]
T'POL: End transmission. Bring up the data file.
[Station Control Hub]
SOONG: Enterprise. Enterprise, come in.
LOKESH: They cut us off.
SOONG: What are these orders?
ARCHER: To initiate the station's self-destruct sequence.
(Malik starts working controls.)
ARCHER: In a few seconds, this place will be dust.
SOONG: You'd kill us all, rather than let the embryos be born.
ARCHER: It wasn't my idea. The orders came from Starfleet, but after
seeing this I can't say I disagree.
MALIK: We were defending our right to exist.
ARCHER: You've already killed over twenty five people. Your existence
has a pretty high price.
MALIK: It could get higher.
[Bridge]
HOSHI: The sequence is coming up.
TUCKER: T'Pol?
T'POL: Proceed.
HOSHI: Transmitting. Ten seconds to auto-destruct.
(Suddenly there's a nasty noise.)
HOSHI: It's some kind of feedback pulse. It's the signal we sent. It's
being amplified a thousand percent.
Comm.'s dead.
TUCKER: The station's still there. It's safe to say we're going to need
another plan.
T'POL: We'll destroy it ourselves.
TUCKER: That thing's buried inside an asteroid.
T'POL: It's not the preferred solution, but it's all we have. Load
photonic torpedoes. Mister Mayweather?
TRAVIS: Course set.
T'POL: Take us in.
[Station Control Hub]
SOONG: Looks like this place isn't turning to dust.
Sorry to disappoint you.
MALIK: They're friends. I heard them talking. (to Lucas) Is this true,
Doctor? Let's find out.
(He grabs Phlox and hauls him away)
LUCAS: No!
ARCHER: Leave him alone!
SOONG: Malik.
(Phlox is put in the isolation tube.)
MALIK: You'll tell us what we want to hear, or you'll watch him die,
too.
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: Five thousand kilometres.
T'POL: Lock weapons.
(The Klingon bird-of-prey comes out of hiding and shoots at them,
causing damage.)
TUCKER: Starboard nacelle.
T'POL: Return fire.
[Station Control Hub]
SOONG: Stop. Stop!
(Malik pushes him away.)
LUCAS: No. No. I'll give it to you. Don't kill him! I'll give it to you!
SOONG: Input the code.
LOKESH: The stasis chamber is opening. It worked.
SOONG: Get him out of there.
(Malik releases Phlox. Soong goes over to Smike.)
SOONG: You come with us.
SMIKE: I'm going to stay.
SOONG: I understand. I hope you have a long, happy life.
SMIKE: You too, Father.
[Bridge]
TUCKER: They fire, then move off.
T'POL: They're trying to draw us away from the station.
TUCKER: A few more like that, we're going to be a part of this asteroid
field.
T'POL: Hold your course. Target the facility.
[Stasis chamber]
(Each embryo is in a sphere on the walls.)
LOKESH: They're beautiful.
SOONG: I came here so many times just to look at them. I remember where
each of you was kept. You were there right next to Saul. Persis, Yavar.
It was so hard to choose nineteen out of so many.
LOKESH: Father?
SOONG: I never thought I'd see this sight again.
[Station Control Hub]
(Enterprise gets in it's first shot at the
asteroid.)
PERSIS: We have to hurry.
MALIK: Telurian plague. I like the sound of that.
(He adds it to the list of Xenopolycythemia, Synthococcus Novae Type A,
Rigelian Fever.)
PERSIS: What are you doing?
MALIK: Identifying the most dangerous pathogens.
PERSIS: You're taking them with us.
MALIK: Can't hurt to have a little insurance. They've been transferred
to the stasis modules. Take two people with you, load them onto the
shuttle.
PERSIS: Get them in the containment cell.
(Lucas, Smike and the others are hustled in. Archer is last, and
manages to slam the door back against Saul, knocking him down. Smike
tries to tackle Malik, but gets thrown off. Malik locks the cell then
deals with Archer.)
MALIK: I wasn't sure how I'd justify killing you. Now you've given me
the perfect excuse.
ARCHER: Whatever I can do to help.
(Malik throws the disrupter to Saul.)
MALIK:
Hold onto that. You're a competent fighter, but that isn't good enough.
(He easily throws Archer around the room.)
MALIK: I wish I had time to continue our little match. I'm enjoying it.
But this will be almost as satisfying. Five minutes after we leave,
every stasis field in this station will shut down, releasing hundreds
of pathogens. I wonder which one will kill you first.
ARCHER: Stick around and find out.
MALIK: I like you, Captain. I can't allow my brother to die in such a
way. This will be much less painful.
(He shoots Smike then leaves with Saul.)
ARCHER: Smike.
[Bridge]
TUCKER: They're launching a shuttle.
TRAVIS: The bird-of-prey's moving to intercept.
T'POL: Who's on the shuttle?
TUCKER: Augments and one human.
T'POL: Soong. Fire torpedoes.
[Denobulan shuttle]
MALIK: They've launched a torpedo.
SOONG: Maximum thrusters.
(The torpedo hits the Klingon ship just as the shuttle gets there, then
they go to warp.)
[Station Control Hub]
(Everyone has been freed from the cell.)
LUCAS: Four minutes to containment breach. There's no way to stop it
from here.
REED: Somewhere else?
LUCAS: The primary junction.
ARCHER: Where is it?
(Lucas hands him a PADD and the gallant Captain heads off into the
core, climbing up a central ladder.)

The Enterprise Transcripts - The Augments
The
Augments
 Mission date: May 27, 2154
Original Airdate: 12 Nov, 2004
  T'POL
[OC]: Previously, on Enterprise

SOONG [Starfleet
HQ - cell]: Jonathan Archer. What brings you here?
ARCHER: Someone attacked a Klingon bird-of-prey. The entire crew was
massacred, the ship's missing. They were Augments.
PERSIS [Malik's quarters]: You
were leading us before. And now he is. You can't accept that.
MALIK: Why shouldn't I lead? Augments should be led by Augments.
ARCHER [Situation room]: We've
been authorised to use whatever force necessary to stop Soong.
SOONG [Station Control Hub]:
We know you can get to the embryos. Give us what we came for.
MALIK: You'll tell us what we want to hear, or you'll watch him die,
too.
MALIK: Every stasis field in this station will shut down, releasing
hundreds of pathogens. I wonder which one will kill you first.
LUCAS: There's no way to stop it from here.
REED: Somewhere else?
LUCAS: The primary junction.

T'POL [OC]: And now, the conclusion.
[Station Control Hub]
PHLOX: Containment breach in forty seconds.
REED: He's almost there.
[Station core]
ARCHER: I'm at the primary junction!
[Station Control Hub]
REED: You have to divert the secondary relays.
[Station core]
REED [OC]: The panel to the left.
ARCHER: I see them.
[Station Control Hub]
PHLOX: Twenty seconds.
LUCAS: He's isolated this room. The pathogens can't reach us.
REED: What about the Captain?
LUCAS: The ventilation grid is going to carry the pathogens through the
rest of the station, including the central core.
[Station core]
(Alarms are going off)
ARCHER: How long do I have?
[Station Control Hub]
LUCAS: Less than a minute.
[Station core]
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol
T'POL [OC]: Go ahead.
ARCHER: Can you get
[Bridge]
ARCHER [OC}: A transporter lock on me?
T'POL: There's too much interference from the core.
[Station core]
T'POL [OC]: You'll have to get farther away.
ARCHER: Arm the phase-cannons. Target exterior hatch
[Bridge]
ARCHER [OC]: J nine.
T'POL: Captain, the core will decompress.
ARCHER: That's the idea. Stand by on the transporter. You'll only have
a few seconds.
T'POL: Acknowledged.
[Station core]
COMPUTER: Warning. Pathogens detected in the
central core.
ARCHER: T'Pol!
T'POL [OC]: We're ready.
ARCHER: Fire!
(A single phase cannon shot blows the top off part of the
superstructure, letting gasses and one human fly out into the vacuum of
space - where he disappears.)
[Bridge]
T'POL: Commander, do you have him?
[Transporter alcove]
(Archer is covered in frost.)
TUCKER: Yeah, we need a medic down here.
[Klingon Bridge]
(Malik is lounging in his favourite seat.)
MALIK: We've crossed into Klingon space.
(He eventually gives up the Captain's chair to Soong.)
SOONG: Where's Enterprise?
PERSIS: They're holding position.
SOONG: Archer's not foolish enough to follow us.
MALIK: We won't be seeing Archer again.
SOONG: What are you saying?
MALIK: He's dead.
SOONG: No one was to be killed without my express order!
MALIK: I had no choice. He attacked us, tried to escape.
SOONG: If you disobey me again, I'll lock you in the targ pit. You
won't see the light of day for a month. Do I make myself clear?
MALIK: Yes, Father.
SOONG: What's our speed?
GIRL: Holding at warp three point eight.
SOONG: Not fast enough. The port inducer assembly's been damaged. Go to
Engineering and repair it.
MALIK: I'm not an engineer.
SOONG: You're a bright boy, Malik. I'm sure you'll figure it out.
T'POL [OC]: First Officer's log, Supplemental.
We've evacuated the Away Team and all personnel from the station. The
Captain shows no sign of infection. He's recovering in Sickbay.
[Sickbay]
REED: They crossed the Klingon border approximately
two hours ago.
TUCKER: Soong's not even bothering to cover his tracks.
REED: He knows the Klingons will intercept us if we follow him. They
have half a dozen patrols in the area.
ARCHER: Is there something we can do to keep us from showing up on
their sensors?
TUCKER: I could paint a bird-of-prey on the hull.
REED: Perhaps we could fake a Klingon warp signature.
TUCKER: I'd have to reconfigure the coil assembly. It would take a few
hours, but it should be doable.
ARCHER: What's the status of C-12?
T'POL: Doctor Lucas and his team would like to return and begin
decontamination procedures.
TUCKER: That's quite a mess they've got to clean up.
T'POL: He estimates it will take more than a year.
[Klingon Bridge]
SOONG: Once we're safely through Klingon space,
we'll set a course for these coordinates. The Klingons call it Klach
D'kel Brakt. I call it the Briar Patch. It's a little catchier, don't
you think?
LOKESH: Briar Patch?
SOONG: You should have read more of the books I left for you. The
region is flooded with radiation from supernova remnants. The Klingons
have never mapped it. There are signs of at least two habitable planets
inside the Briar Patch. It's unlikely anyone will find us.
MALIK: This is your plan? To hide again?
SOONG: The embryos need to mature in a safe environment.
MALIK: Starfleet isn't going to give up so easily. They'll send other
ships. This gas cloud won't protect us.
SOONG: All right. What course would you set?
MALIK: I'm not certain. But I know that running away isn't the answer.
Are you familiar with the name Botany Bay?
PERSIS: It's a penal colony on the shores of Australia.
MALIK: It's also the name of a pre-warp vessel launched at the end of
the Great Wars. The ship carried many of our brethren, including Khan
Noonien Singh.
SOONG: Botany Bay is a myth. There's no evidence it ever existed.
MALIK: All records of the launch were destroyed. They didn't want to be
followed.
SOONG: Even if you're right, the ship was lost, never to be heard from
again.
MALIK: That's exactly my point. Khan was a great leader, but he made
one fatal mistake. He ran from his enemies rather than face them. We've
spent our entire lives running and hiding. When are we going to make a
stand?
SOONG: The matter is not open for debate. Alter our heading. Set a
course one eight four mark three. We're going to the Briar Patch. I'll
be in my lab.
[Bridge]
T'POL: I wasn't aware the Doctor discharged you.
ARCHER: He didn't. What's our status?
T'POL: Holding position near the Klingon border.
ARCHER: Bridge to Engineering.
[Engineering]
ARCHER [OC]: Are we ready?
I've realigned the warp coils. We should look like a Klingon battle
cruiser to their sensors, but this trick's not going to work if we get
within eighty thousand kilometres.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Understood. Tactical Alert. Take us in,
Travis. Warp four.
[Klingon ship - Soong's lab]
SOONG: Come in, Malik.
MALIK: You asked for me?
SOONG: You have to stop challenging my authority in front of the
others.
MALIK: Can't a son disagree with his father? I thought we were family.
SOONG: I'm willing to overlook the things you've done. But you have to
trust that what I'm doing is best for all of us. You used to have faith
in me.
MALIK: I was a child. I didn't know any better.
SOONG: I know it wasn't easy after I left.
MALIK: How are the embryos?
SOONG: I'll be ready to incubate the first of them in a few hours.
MALIK: You're manipulating its DNA.
SOONG: These base-pairs sequences regulate the neurotransmitter levels
in their brain. If I can modify them, aggression and violent behaviour
will be removed.
MALIK: You're changing its personality.
SOONG: I'm correcting a defect in its genome. Genetic engineering was
in its infancy when you were created. They weren't able to repair all
the mistakes.
MALIK: Did you fix these mistakes in the rest of us?
SOONG: I didn't know how until recently.
MALIK: What right do you have to tamper with their genome?
SOONG: Trust me. I know what I'm doing.
MALIK: You don't know that this is a defect. Maybe this is the way our
creators wanted us to be.
PERSIS [OC]: Father, you're needed on the Bridge.
[Klingon Bridge]
PERSIS: There's a ship approaching at high warp.
SOONG: Have you identified it?
PERSIS: It appears to be Klingon.
SOONG: Let's see them.
(Enterprise appears on the viewscreen.)
PERSIS: This ship has minimal aft weapons.
SOONG: Increase speed.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Arm torpedoes. Open a channel. This is
Captain Archer.
[Klingon Bridge]
ARCHER [OC}: Drop out of warp or we'll disable you.
SOONG: He sounds pretty confident for a dead man. Aft torpedoes. Target
their propulsion systems.
{Bridge]
(The ship rocks under the impact.)
REED: Forward plating's holding.
ARCHER: Return fire.
[Klingon Bridge]
PERSIS: Aft shields at fifty percent
MALIK: We should engage them.
SOONG: They outgun us three to one.
MALIK: Father!
SOONG: The Denobulan pilot. Put her aboard the shuttle. Go!
(Malik leaves.)
SOONG: Scan for any planets along our flight path.
[Bridge]
REED: Their warp field's fluctuating.
ARCHER: Concentrate all fire on their engines.
T'POL: They've altered course. They're heading for a planetary system.
[Klingon Bridge]
(As Enterprises' torpedoes keep finding their
mark.)
PERSIS: We've reached the coordinates.
SOONG: Take us out of warp.
(The bird of prey arrives at a blue gas giant with a moon.)
[Bridge]
T'POL: They're moving into a low orbit.
HOSHI: They're opening their shuttlebay doors.
ARCHER: Hold your fire. Magnify.
(the little ship is held by tractor beams)
ARCHER: Bio-signs on the shuttle?
T'POL: One. Denobulan.
(The shuttle is thrown down into the gas giant's atmosphere.)
ARCHER: Can you get a transporter lock?
T'POL: The atmosphere is too dense.
HOSHI: We're being hailed. It's Soong.
ARCHER: Murdering hostages is turning into a new hobby for you.
SOONG [on viewscreen]: No one's been
[Klingon Bridge]
SOONG: Killed, Captain. That ship is caught between
two thermal layers. It should be relatively safe for four or five
hours. Enough time for you to mount a rescue mission.
{Bridge]
(T'Pol nods her agreement with the assessment.)
ARCHER: This isn't over, Doctor.
SOONG [on viewscreen]: Good-bye, Captain.
(Ends transmission.)
T'POL: He's gone to warp.
[Klingon Engineering]
(Large scale repairs are underway, so Soong and
Malik go on a tour of inspection.)
SOONG: Disconnect that circuit before you power the relay. You might
damage it.
MALIK: Warp trail's been dispersed. Enterprise won't be able to follow
us.
SOONG: Excellent work.
MALIK: There's something else we need. (Soong walks away) Father! I
need to speak with you.
SOONG: What is it?
MALIK: We've underestimated them. Starfleet isn't going to stop until
they find us.
SOONG: And what do you suggest we do, turn ourselves in?
MALIK: Before we left C-12, I beamed aboard two dozen canisters of
biogenic agents.
SOONG: You did what?!
MALIK: We can modify a torpedo to carry the pathogens.
SOONG: A single torpedo would never make it through their hull plating.
MALIK: I wasn't talking about the Enterprise. We use it against the
Klingons. The Qu'Vat colony is less than four light-years away. If we
detonate the torpedo inside the upper atmosphere, it'll scatter the
pathogen across the entire planet. Every organism on the surface will
be dead within days. When the High Council hears that humans have
decimated their colony, they'll launch a counterstrike. The Klingons
will keep Starfleet busy for years.
SOONG: What you're proposing is mass murder.
MALIK: There is no other choice. How long will it be before Starfleet
turns to the Klingons for help in finding us? This is the only way to
guarantee our survival.
SOONG: Go back to the Bridge.
MALIK: What happened to you in prison? You're not the man who raised
us. The man who was willing to do whatever was necessary.
SOONG: Return to your station.
Captain's Starlog, Supplemental. We've rescued the
pilot of the Denobulan shuttle. Fortunately, her injuries were minor.
Trip and T'Pol are trying to enhance our sensors in an effort to find
the bird-of-prey.
[Engineering]
T'POL: Target the directional array on grid four
five nine. How are your parents?
TUCKER: They're fine. They moved into a new house in Mississippi. It's
not like the old place in Panama City, but it's pretty nice. Why do you
ask?
T'POL: You haven't spoken of them recently. In fact, you've said very
little since I returned from Vulcan.
TUCKER: There hasn't been a lot of time to catch up.
T'POL: You also haven't joined us at the Captain's table since we left
Earth.
TUCKER: What are you trying to say?
T'POL: You've been avoiding me.
TUCKER: Well, maybe I have. But you got to admit, it's a little
awkward. I mean, you're married. I know you did it to help your mother,
but it's going to take me a little time to adjust.
T'POL: I'm still adjusting to it myself.
TUCKER: This is going to sound strange, but as tough as it was watching
you go through with the ceremony, I was proud of you for what you did.
Yeah, I guess it's probably for the best.
T'POL: What do you mean?
TUCKER: Come on. It's not like we would have made an ideal couple. A
Vulcan and a human? Romeo and Juliet probably stood a better chance.
T'POL: Subspace distortion. Zero point four light years.
TUCKER: There's no sign of a warp trail.
T'POL: They might have concealed their engine emissions.
TUCKER: Engineering to Bridge.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
TUCKER: I think we've found him, Captain.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: You don't sound a hundred percent sure.
TUCKER: It's the best we've got.
ARCHER: Send the coordinates to Mister Mayweather. Lay in a pursuit
course, maximum warp.
[Malik's quarters]
PERSIS: I don't have a lot of time. The aft
launcher's still offline, and Father wants me to
MALIK: You won't have to answer to him any longer. I'm taking command.
PERSIS: You can't.
MALIK: I've already spoken with everyone on the Bridge. They're behind
me, but I need to know where you stand. You helped me before.
PERSIS: That was different. This is our father.
MALIK: He may have raised us, but that doesn't make him our father.
He'll never be one of us.
PERSIS: Don't do this to him.
MALIK: He's given me no choice. I have a plan to protect us from
Starfleet and the Klingons, and he won't even consider it. You know
what he's doing with the embryos? He's altering their genome. Making
them weak and docile, like ordinary humans.
PERSIS: That's not true.
MALIK: Go to his lab, talk to him yourself. I know how much he means to
you. I have feelings for him, too. He'll be treated with respect. You
have my word. Are you with me?
[Soong's lab]
MALIK: Father, please come with us.
SOONG: Persis? Four of you to subdue me?
MALIK: The crew is united behind me.
SOONG: Is that so? There's no time for this. You all have work to do.
MALIK: Don't make this more difficult than it needs to be.
SONG: And if I refuse, are you going to kill me?
MALIK: No one else has to die.
SOONG: What about the millions you plan to kill with that bioweapon?
PERSIS: Please, Father. There's no other way.
MALIK: Lock him in his quarters.
[Bridge]
T'POL: A Klingon battle cruiser, point three light
years away. They're on an intercept course.
ARCHER: Archer to Engineering.
[Engineering]
ARCHER [OC]: Is there a problem with the
camouflage?
TUCKER: Not that I can see.
[Bridge]
TUCKER [OC]: Our Klingon warp signature's holding
steady.
REED: They'll be in visual range in less than two minutes.
ARCHER: Universal translator. Did you update the database?
HOSHI: It's been programmed with seven Klingon dialects.
ARCHER: Let's hope this guy speaks one of them. Open a channel.
Attention, cruiser. If you come any closer to my ship, you'll be fired
upon.
KLINGON [OC]: Who is this?
ARCHER: My name isn't your concern.
KLINGON [OC]: You've entered restricted space. Drop out of warp and
prepare for inspection.
ARCHER: The last time I checked this was still Klingon territory.
KLINGON [OC]: No ship is allowed to pass through this system without
authorisation, on the orders of Governor Klag.
ARCHER: I don't take orders from a mere governor. We're on important
business for the High Council.
KLINGON [OC]: What sort of business?
ARCHER: That matter is classified.
KLINGON [OC]: I'm not detecting a Council transponder signal. Perhaps
you forgot to activate it.
ARCHER: You expect me to turn on a transponder and let every ship in
the area know that we have the Chancellor on board?
KLINGON [OC]: Chancellor M'Rek is on your ship?
ARCHER: He had important negotiations with the Orions. We're taking him
back to Kronos.
KLINGON [OC]: The Orions. (laughs) I've heard rumours of his
negotiations with their females. Tell me, is it true what they say
about them?
ARCHER: If I were you, I wouldn't be making allegations about
Chancellor M'Rek over an unsecure channel.
KLINGON [OC]: I meant no insult.
ARCHER: I'm sure you didn't. It would be best if you made no mention of
this to your superiors, or you might find yourself commanding a garbage
scow.
KLINGON [OC]: Understood. We're honoured to have the Chancellor in our
system. Qapla'.
ARCHER: Qapla'.
REED: They're altering course.
[Soong's quarters]
SOONG: Don't tell me it's visiting hour.
PERSIS: I'm sorry, Father. If I didn't go along with him, he would've
killed me.
SOONG: You did the right thing. If he deploys that weapon, he'll be
confirming everything they've said about Augments for the last hundred
and fifty years. They'll destroy all of you. You have to help me stop
him. We can sabotage the engines or the torpedo launchers.
PERSIS: No, we'll never get to them. Malik's posted guards at every
vital system.
SOONG: You have to get me off the ship.
[Klingon ship corridor]
PERSIS: I've disabled the internal sensors. It
should be some time before anyone notices one of the escape pods is
missing.
(Soong climbs in.)
SOONG: Be careful, he might suspect you.
(He kisses her hand, she closes the hatch and the little pod drops into
space as the bird of prey warps away.)
[Bridge]
ARCHER: What is it?
HOSHI: An automated beacon. It's very faint. It could be a distress
signal.
ARCHER: (to T'Pol) Can you get a fix on it?
[Escape pod]
(There's shaking, and clanging, and more shaking.
Then the hatch opens.)
SOONG: Captain. What took you so long?
[Brig]
SOONG: You have to alter your
(He realises that Archer hasn't turned on the intercom yet.)
SOONG: You have to alter your course.
ARCHER: Is that so?
SOONG: My children. The Augments are planning to attack a Klingon
colony.
ARCHER: What were you doing in that escape pod?
SOONG: What do you think? I was waiting for you. You're the only one
who can stop them! I didn't come back because I missed our lively
debates. Please, please, you have to do as I ask.
ARCHER: Your story doesn't sound very plausible. I think we were
getting close to finding your Augments. You may have put yourself into
that escape pod to throw us off.
SOONG: You're not serious.
ARCHER: You've made it clear you'll do anything for them. Lie, murder,
maybe even sacrifice yourself.
SOONG: If the Klingons retaliate against Earth, it'll make the Xindi
Incident look like a lovers' quarrel.
ARCHER: What do you care what happens to Earth? You believe your
children are the future of humanity.
SOONG: Captain. Captain, contact C-12! Three hundred kilograms of
biotoxins are missing from their inventory.
ARCHER: Doctor Lucas already told me about the missing toxins.
SOONG: Malik stole them without my knowledge. He's going to use them on
the colony. You saw what he did on the station. You know what he's
capable of.
ARCHER: You didn't know? You had to see him murder someone in front of
you.
SOONG: What do you want me to say? That you were right about them, and
I was wrong? Maybe things would have been different if I'd been there
for them, if Starfleet hadn't locked me away.
ARCHER: None of that would have mattered in the end. It's in their
nature. They were engineered to be this way. Superior ability breeds
superior ambition. One of their creators wrote that. He was murdered by
an Augment.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: Work with Soong. He'll show you how to scan
for their warp trail. I want to intercept them before they reach the
colony.
T'POL: He may be leading us into a trap.
ARCHER: I believe him.
TUCKER: That planet's over three light years away. We're going to have
to push the engines pretty hard to get there in time.
ARCHER: Is that a problem?
TUCKER: At that speed, our phony warp signature might not fool the
Klingons.
ARCHER: Do what you have to do.
[Malik's quarters]
(Malik and Persis are in bed, but she has her back
turned towards him.)
PERSIS: You've been quiet.
MALIK: Soong didn't get off this ship without help. The sensor grid
wasn't damaged in the attack. Someone took it offline to cover his
escape.
PERSIS: Maybe he disabled it.
MALIK: He would've needed the security codes. I never gave them to him.
PERSIS: If Father didn't do it, then who?
MALIK: Can you think of anyone?
PERSIS: Lokesh didn't seem that enthusiastic about your plan to attack
the Klingons.
MALIK: He's been in the weapons bay for a day and a half, modifying the
torpedo. Maybe I should torture him, just to make sure. What do you
think? Only four of us have the codes. Of those four, you and I are the
only ones who weren't on the Bridge when Soong escaped.
PERSIS: You think I did it.
MALIK: Your heart's beating faster. Perhaps it's trying to tell me
something.
(she gets up and grabs a knife)
MALIK: Are you going to use that on me?
PERSIS: If I have to.
(He moves towards her and she cuts him.)
MALIK: You shouldn't have done that.
(They fight, he overpowers her and breaks her back in several places.)
MALIK: I'll miss you.
(He kisses her as she dies, unable to breathe,)
[Situation room]
SOONG: How long can we sustain warp five?
TUCKER: As long as the Captain wants it. Or until we blow up, whichever
comes first.
SOONG: Adjust the scanning frequency fifteen megahertz. (to T'Pol)
Sorry about that business with the Orions. Hope you weren't permanently
injured.
TUCKER: Why don't you stay focused on what you're doing?
SOONG: Someone's a little protective of Commander T'Pol.
TUCKER: I just don't like you very much.
SOONG: (as a panel beeps) Is that them?
T'POL: It is a ship, but it's not the bird-of-prey. Captain Archer to
the Bridge.
(Tucker heads off to Engineering as T'Pol takes her station and Archer
comes in from his ready room.)
[Bridge]
T'POL: It's a Klingon vessel. They're on an
intercept course.
REED: It's a lot bigger than the last one. This one's a D5 class battle
cruiser.
ARCHER: How long until we're in visual range?
T'POL: Two minutes.
ARCHER: Same as before, Hoshi.
HOSHI: They're hailing us.
KLINGON [OC]: Earth vessel, surrender and prepare to be boarded!
(Enterprise comes under attack.)
REED: Aft plating is failing.
ARCHER: Hail them again. (to Klingon on viewscreen) If we don't reach
the colony before that bird-of-prey, millions of your people will be
killed.
KLINGON [on viewscreen]: I am not detecting any other ships. Perhaps
you plan to attack the colony!
SOONG: Captain, if I may. (in Klingon) Captain Archer and his crew are
honourable people. Let them continue on their way.
KLINGON [on viewscreen] Drop out of warp, or we'll destroy your ship!
(ends transmission)
SOONG: I tried.
(Another salvo rocks Enterprise.)
REED: We may be able to surprise them with a torpedo if we drop to
impulse.
SOONG: I wouldn't recommend that, Captain. Their sensors are far
superior. They'll detect it.
T'POL: They're targeting our reactor.
ARCHER: Power down weapons. Stand by to deploy the grappler. Take us
out of warp.
TRAVIS: They've dropped to impulse.
ARCHER: Malcolm?
REED: Two more seconds, Captain.
ARCHER: On my mark, Travis.
HOSHI: They're closing. They're extending their docking port.
ARCHER: Malcolm?
REED: Ready, sir.
(The grappler lines shoot out and attach to one of the Klingon's
nacelles.)
ARCHER: Full impulse.
REED: They're targeting the grappler.
ARCHER: Hold your speed.
T'POL: The shearing force is approaching critical.
REED: We're losing the grappler.
ARCHER: Hold your speed.
(There are explosions along the nacelle, and two feeble disrupter beams
are fired.)
T'POL: They can't create a warp field. They're disabled.
ARCHER: Resume course for the colony, maximum speed.
[Klingon Bridge]
LOKESH: There are three population centres. Two
here, and another on the northern continent.
MALIK: We'll detonate the torpedo over the southern hemisphere. That'll
ensure the maximum number of casualties. What's the weapon's status?
LOKESH: We've modified the warhead, but we need to test the guidance
protocols before we can
GIRL: There's a ship on an intercept course.
MALIK: The Enterprise. Increase to maximum speed. Load the torpedo.
Stand by to fire as soon as we drop out of warp.
LOKESH: But the guidance protocols?
MALIK: Do as I say!
[Bridge]
T'POL: They've detected us. They're accelerating.
ARCHER: Stay with them, Travis.
TUCKER [OC]: Tucker to Bridge.
[Engineering]
TUCKER: If we go any faster, the nacelles are going
to fly off the pylons.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: long until we're in weapons range?
T'POL: Two minutes, but the bird-of-prey will reach the colony in
seventy three seconds.
ARCHER: Trip.
[Engineering]
TUCKER: I heard. I'll give you what I can.
{Klingon Bridge]
(The ship has dropped into orbit of the colony
planet.)
MALIK: How much longer?
LOKESH: Guidance is still offline. We'll need to get closer.
MALIK: Take us into low orbit.
[Bridge]
T'POL: They're preparing to fire.
ARCHER: Travis.
TRAVIS: Another fifteen seconds.
ARCHER: Take us out of warp as close as you can.
REED: Weapons are standing by.
T'POL: Ten seconds.
[Klingon Bridge]
LOKESH: Torpedo's ready.
MALIK: Fire.
[Bridge]
(Enterprise drops out of warp.)
T'POL: They've launched the weapon. It will reach the atmosphere in
twelve seconds.
ARCHER: Malcolm.
(Three torpedoes are launched to chase down the bioweapon. There is a
nice explosion above the planet's atmosphere.)
ARCHER: Hard about.
(Enterprise is attacked by disrupter fire, and there are lots of
bangs.)
REED: A direct hit to the Armoury. We've lost hull plating, torpedo
launchers.
ARCHER: What about phase-cannons?
REED: The aft cannon's online, just barely.
ARCHER: Lock onto their Bridge.
SOONG: No, no, no!
ARCHER: Stand aside, Doctor!
SOONG: Their Bridge is protected with dispersive armour. Your weapons
will never penetrate it. Target your cannons here.
(He points to a schematic on T'Pol's console.)
SOONG: Behind their sensor array.
ARCHER: What good will that do?
SOONG: Their main plasma junction's located there. A direct hit would
disable their entire power grid. Trust me.
ARCHER: Do what he says. Fire when ready.
(Two neat phase cannon shots hit the mark and cause havoc in the
Augment's ship.)
T'POL: They're disabled.
SOONG: Are they still alive?
T'POL: I'm reading twelve biosigns.
(On the Klingon bridge, an injured Malik crawls over dead bodies to the
rear console, hauls himself up and reaches for the self-destruct. This
is a very familiar scene, but without the Moby Dick dialogue.)
[Bridge]
OFFICER: Captain, there's a power surge in their
reactor.
REED: He's overloading his dilithium matrix. He'll destroy their ship.
SOONG: Let me talk to him.
(Hoshi opens the channel.)
SOONG: Malik. Malik, it's Father.
[Klingon Bridge]
SOONG [OC]: Don't do this. Some of your brothers
and sisters are still alive.
MALIK: Would you rather they go to prison with you?
SOONG [OC]: The embryos.
MALIK: There's no place for us on Earth or anywhere else.
[Bridge]
MALIK [OC]: Better to die here.
SOONG: Please, please, please!
[Klingon Bridge]
MALIK: I'll see you soon.
[Bridge]
[Bridge]
SOONG: Malik!
T'POL: Sir.
(They watch the bird-of-prey blow itself to smithereens on the
viewscreen.)
[Corridor]
(Soong is back in his handcuffs.)
ARCHER: I'll contact Starfleet on your behalf. Let them know that you
helped us.
SOONG: I can't believe they're gone. All of them. Uh, we're heading the
wrong way.
ARCHER: You're not going to the brig. I'm taking you to crew quarters.
(Suddenly, Malik drops from the ceiling and deals with the sole MACO
escorting them, then knocks out Archer.)
SOONG: You're alive.
MALIK: You betrayed us all! Goodbye, Father.
(But before he can throttle Soong, a neat hole is drilled in him by a
phase rifle. Archer had recovered quickly.)
Captain's Starlog, May 27, 2154. Our actions at the
Klingon colony appear to have satisfied the High Council. They've
called off their plans to retaliate against Earth.
[Starfleet HQ - cell]
(There are no sheets of paper on the wall, or piled
up on the floor.)
SOONG: You could at least let me finish my work, before you take it
away and destroy it.
ARCHER: No one's destroyed anything. It's being stored in a secure
location. Maybe someday, we'll figure out how to use it to benefit
humanity.
SOONG: I wouldn't count on it.
(The cell door is closed, and the handcuffs released.)
SOONG: I've been thinking. Perfecting humanity may not be possible.
Cybernetics. Artificial lifeforms.
ARCHER: Good-bye, Doctor.
(Walks away, leaving Soong to muse alone.)
SOONG: I doubt I'll finish the work myself. Might take a generation or
two.
(He sits down, takes up his pencil, and smiles.)

The Enterprise Transcripts - The Forge
The Forge
 Original Airdate: 19 Nov, 2004
  [Vulcan
- seventeen years ago]
 (We are gazing at those Fire Plains that T'Pol
took Trip to see before she got married. Underground, a man is
squeezing himself through tunnels that have at least been modified by
people, judging by the shapes of the openings. He finds a box with the
bust of a male carved on top of it, and begins to gently brush off the
dust of the ages to reveal an inscription.)
AREV: Surak.
 Admiral Maxwell Forrest's Personal Log. I've
arrived on Vulcan, hopeful that the High Command is finally ready to
conduct joint missions with Starfleet.
 [United Earth Embassy]
 SOVAL: Admiral, the High Command will tell you its
decision at the proper time.
FORREST: After all we've been through, I'd rather hear the good news
from you.
SOVAL: The High Command hasn't included me in their discussions.
FORREST: They're not telling their own Ambassador to Earth what they're
planning? Welcome to the club.
SOVAL: Admiral, I know you find our reluctance to share technology and
discoveries restrictive.
FORREST: I can think of a few stronger words than that.
SOVAL: We don't know what to do about humans. Of all the species we've
made contact with, yours is the only one we can't define. You have the
arrogance of Andorians, the stubborn pride of Tellarites. One moment,
you're as driven by your emotions as Klingons, and the next, you
confound us by suddenly embracing logic.
FORREST :I'm sure those qualities are found in every species.
(They pass through the retina scanner at the Embassy security check.)
SOVAL: Not in such confusing abundance.
FORREST: Ambassador. Are Vulcans afraid of humans? Why?
SOVAL: Because there is one species you remind us of.
FORREST: Vulcans.
SOVAL: We had our wars, Admiral, just as humans did. Our planet was
devastated, our civilisation nearly destroyed. Logic saved us. But it
took almost fifteen hundred years for us to rebuild our world and
travel to the stars. You humans did the same in less than a century.
There are those on the High Command who wonder what humans would
achieve in the century to come, and they don't like the answer.
FORREST: We're not the Klingons. We only want to be your partners. To
do what the nations of Earth have learned to do. To work together in
common cause.
SOVAL: Unfortunately, the future of relations between our worlds is not
mine to control.
(There's a dull thud sound. Max looks back then suddenly grabs Soval
and pushes him to the floor as the dust from an explosion billows
towards them and the building starts to fall apart. Then there is a
second explosion, and the top of the Embassy is blown off.)
[Launch bay two]
(I'm just guessing from the numbers 3 and 4 on the
floor and the hinges on the sections which imply that they open
downwards.
Wherever on Enterprise it is, right now it's a basketball court for the
senior staff.)
REED: Captain!
HOSHI: Here!
(She catches the ball but her shot is deflected to a stationary Phlox,
who easily puts it through the hoop.)
TUCKER: That's another game. Twenty one to two.
HOSHI: Time to switch sides again, Doctor.
PHLOX: Certainly. This is a most enjoyable sport. Reminiscent of Octran
fertility contests.
(T'Pol enters.)
T'POL: Captain, I've just spoken with Starfleet Command.
PHLOX: Except we're fully clothed, which is probably for the best.
Captain's starlog, supplemental. Enterprise has
arrived at Vulcan as ordered. Three days after the bombing of Earth's
embassy, the death toll stands at forty three, and I have lost my
friend, Admiral Forrest. Vulcan authorities still have no lead on who's
responsible.
[Corridor]
ARCHER: I'm sorry to keep you from your family, but
I'm going to need you on the investigation full-time.
T'POL: That's where I prefer to be.
ARCHER: Your mother and husband will understand?
(They arrive at the airlock and Archer works the console.)
T'POL: My mother hasn't responded to my communiqués. It's not unusual
for her to become lost in her work. As for my husband, our arrangement
remains unchanged.
V'LAS: Captain Jonathan Archer, I regret we meet under such tragic
circumstances.
T'POL: I'd like to introduce Administrator V'Las.
ARCHER: Administrator. I wasn't told to expect the head of the High
Command.
SOVAL: Captain Archer, all of Vulcan grieves with you today.
ARCHER: Twelve Vulcans died in the blast, Ambassador.
V'LAS: To that end, this is Stel, Chief Investigator of our Security
Directorate.
STEL: (a young man) Captain, we now have suspects.
[Conference room]
ARCHER: Andorians? Why would they attack our
embassy?
STEL: To create conflict between Earth and Vulcan.
SOVAL: They do consider us allies who stand against them.
ARCHER: So far, we've done our best to remain neutral, and the
Andorians know that. They have nothing to gain by attacking us.
T'POL: You have other suspects?
STEL: Syrrannites.
ARCHER: I've never heard of that species.
T'POL: Actually, they're a small group of Vulcans. They follow a
corrupted form of Surak's teachings.
ARCHER: Surak I've heard of. He's the father of Vulcan logic.
V'LAS: Even after eighteen hundred years, we consider him the most
important Vulcan who ever lived.
ARCHER: So why would these Syrrannites want to attack our embassy? It's
hardly an act of logic.
SOVAL: They've been vocal about their opposition to government, but
always peaceful.
STEL: Over the past year their leader, a dissident named Syrran, has
become a dangerous zealot.
V'LAS: Captain, I trust you to keep this matter confidential. We don't
share it lightly. But recently, on our world, there have been instances
of violence against non-Vulcans. Though we have no conclusive proof,
there are signs that Syrrannites might be responsible.
ARCHER: Is there any evidence connecting Syrrannites to the bombing?
SOVAL: Your embassy is officially considered to be on Earth soil. We've
preserved the site for you to investigate.
V'LAS: If evidence is there, the Chief Investigator and I feel
confident you'll find it.
ARCHER: I intend to.
[United Earth Embassy]
TRAVIS: Lieutenant, here's the junction room.
(They pick their way carefully through the twisted wreckage, using
torches and scanners.)
TRAVIS: Schematics say the secondary security bank's right in there.
REED: Still in one piece.
TRAVIS: There's a weak power signature under this mess.
REED: It's probably an emergency light running on batteries. Well,
there's something here. Some kind of surveillance recorder.
(Travis lifts a piece of debris to reveal a device.)
TRAVIS: Lieutenant.
REED: The timer might be broken, but that bomb's armed. Don't move. The
slightest vibration might set it off. Reed to Enterprise. I need an
emergency transporter lock. Two to beam up on my mark.
HOSHI [OC]: Acknowledged.
TRAVIS: Why not beam the bomb out of here?
REED: If there's a gravity switch, it'll detonate in the matter stream.
HOSHI [OC]: Enterprise to Reed. The transporter's locked. Do you need
assistance?
REED: Negative, Enterprise. Stand by.
(He puts the open communicator on his shoulder, like a phone.)
REED: I'm going to attempt to scan it.
TRAVIS: Attempt?
REED: Yeah. If I had designed that bomb, I'd rig it to go off the
instant a sensor beam made contact. Look on the bright side. If it
detonates, we'll never know. Steady. There's Vulcan DNA on these
controls. So much for blaming Andorians. Boosting scan resolution.
(The lights on the device start flashing.)
TRAVIS: That can't be good.
REED: Oh, damn. Enterprise, mark. Enterprise!
(And they're beamed away in the nick of time.)
[Sickbay]
(Archer, T'Pol and Stel enter.)
PHLOX: According to the Vulcan Genome Registry, the DNA on the bomb's
controls was left by this woman. T'Pau.
(The image of a young woman is on his overhead monitor.)
ARCHER: Since you had her DNA on record, does that mean she's been
arrested before?
T'POL: The Registry records DNA from all Vulcans at birth.
ARCHER: Do you know anything about her?
STEL: T'Pau is a well-known Syrrannite.
ARCHER: All right. We've got a solid start. Now we need to find her.
STEL: Captain, T'Pau is Vulcan. The Security Directorate will take
charge of the investigation.
ARCHER: Of course. Vulcan sovereignty. Lieutenant Reed and Commander
T'Pol will work with you.
STEL: Their assistance isn't required.
ARCHER: Chief Investigator. Forty three people died in the bombing.
Twelve Vulcans and thirty one humans. We want her as much as you do.
STEL: This is now a Vulcan security operation. We'll inform Ambassador
Soval of any developments that concern you.
[Cargo Bay]
(The place has been turned into a temporary morgue,
with flag draped coffins laid out in rows of seven. Archer walks to the
third one in on the second row from the door and places his hands on
it. The bay doors open and close again.)
SOVAL: His death is a loss to both our worlds.
ARCHER: If you're lost, Ambassador, I can direct you to your shuttle.
SOVAL: He saved my life in the explosion. He could have saved himself.
ARCHER: He always put the mission first.
SOVAL: The last time we spoke, he was anticipating the prospect of
joint missions. Humans and Vulcans working together.
ARCHER: We have to make that possible, despite the High Command.
SOVAL: It makes no sense to think the Syrrannites are responsible for
this outrage.
ARCHER: We have DNA evidence.
SOVAL: Recheck everything, Captain, question everything, and don't let
them keep you on Enterprise. The answers you need are on Vulcan, and
however far you have to take this investigation, you have my support.
[T'Pol's quarters]
T'POL: Enter.
KOSS: It is agreeable to see you.
(They touch fingers.)
T'POL: What is the purpose of your visit?
KOSS: Does a husband need a purpose to visit his wife?
T'POL: Your message was cryptic.
KOSS: By necessity. The Syrrannite threat has brought new security
measures into effect. Private communications are no longer private.
T'POL: You have something to tell me that the authorities shouldn't
hear?
KOSS: Something to give you. Your mother asked me to deliver it
personally. She told me that it's been in your family for generations,
and now it's your turn to care for it.
(He hands over a box containing an IDIC - a circle intersected by a
triangle, with a stone at the centre.)
T'POL: Why didn't she give this to me herself?
KOSS: The new security conditions. They've forced your mother into
hiding to avoid arrest.
T'POL: My mother?
KOSS: She's a Syrrannite.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: A Syrrannite? And she never told you?
T'POL: What's important is that she's disappeared like the others
facing unjustified arrest.
ARCHER: Like T'Pau.
T'POL: No, there's a difference. My mother wants me to find her.
(She shows him the medallion.)
T'POL: It's called an IDIC.
ARCHER: Looks old.
T'POL: It's been modified.
(She presses something and the central stone projects a holographic
map.)
T'POL: This is a desert called the Forge. The route's the one Surak
supposedly followed.
ARCHER: Eighteen hundred years ago?
T'POL: Syrrannites follow the same path today, seeking enlightenment.
ARCHER: And you think your mother is somewhere along that path?
T'POL: She told Koss this was a family heirloom, but I've never seen it
before.
ARCHER: She didn't want Koss to know about the map. With any luck, we
can use this to find your mother, and T'Pau.
[Corridor]
TUCKER: Captain, have you seen the reports on this
place? It's a hellhole.
ARCHER: (in casual clothes) It's a Vulcan desert. I expect it'll be
hot.
TUCKER: It's got electrical sandstorms. Geomagnetic instabilities so
bad, technology won't work. So, no communicators, no scanners, no
phase-pistols. We can't even beam you into it. You're going to have to
walk in.
ARCHER: I'll be careful. You've got Enterprise. You and Malcolm keep
the investigation going up here, and whatever the Vulcans tell you,
believe the opposite.
(They arrive at the transporter alcove.)
ARCHER: Present company excepted. Ambassador.
SOVAL: Captain, Commander. This shows the gaps in our satellite
surveillance, when beam-ins can't be detected.
(He hands over a data module.)
TUCKER: I'm thinking we're not exactly cleared to have this.
SOVAL: Have what, Commander? All I see is a Starfleet data module.
TUCKER: Right. Captain, what if something goes wrong down there?
ARCHER: It already has. Energise.
(T'Pol and Archer beam down to Vulcan.)
[Vulcan]
(The sand glares white and the rocks are pink
beneath the orange sky.)
T'POL: This site is called Gateway, where Surak supposedly began his
journey into the Forge.
ARCHER: You keep saying supposedly. You don't believe Surak did the
things they said he did?
T'POL: He brought logic to Vulcan, in an age we call the Time of
Awakening, but his writings from that period no longer exist.
ARCHER: There must be some record of it.
T'POL: Over the centuries, his followers made copies of his teachings.
ARCHER: Let me guess. With the originals lost, whatever's left is open
to interpretation.
T'POL: You find this amusing?
ARCHER: I find it familiar. We should get moving.
[The Forge - night]
(Archer gazes at lights in the sky.)
ARCHER: I thought technology didn't work here.
T'POL: The dampening field only extends a few hundred metres above the
ground. Patrol craft can fly over it, but their sensors can't see us.
ARCHER: No wonder the Syrrannites like it here.
T'POL: We're being stalked.
(An animal cry rings out in the dark.)
ARCHER: What the hell was that?
T'POL: Sehlat. Run.
(A furry four-legged thing with enormous incisors is chasing them.)
T'POL: Higher ground. Higher. They won't climb.
(The pair scramble up a rock face, and the sehlat paces below.)
ARCHER: How long before it starts to lose interest in us?
T'POL: Days, at least. They're very persistent creatures. When I was a
child, I had one as a pet.
ARCHER: You had one of those?
T'POL: Domesticated. They were smaller, slightly.
ARCHER: How slightly?
T'POL: You have Porthos.
ARCHER: Porthos doesn't try and eat me when I'm late with his dinner.
T'POL: Vulcan children are never late with their sehlat's dinner.
ARCHER: I can believe that.
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: The Captain asked me to re-examine the DNA
from the bomb to see if anyone else might have handled it.
TUCKER: You say you found an anomaly.
PHLOX: In these chromosomal fragments. Here, and here.
REED: What kind of anomaly?
PHLOX: These are telomeres. A genetic clock, if you will. Each time a
cell divides, they grow shorter.
TUCKER: Sure. That's how you tell how old someone is from a cell
sample.
PHLOX: Though T'Pau's current age is thirty two standard years, her DNA
recovered from the bomb has an age of only a few months.
TUCKER: They used the DNA they sampled when she was registered as a
baby.
PHLOX: Precisely. The evidence implicating T'Pau is false.
TUCKER: Captain Archer's gone after the wrong person.
REED: And there's no way to get word to him.
TUCKER: Doc, take a look at this.
(They cross to another monitor.)
TUCKER: It's the recording Malcolm recovered from the embassy.
REED: According to the security log, this is when T'Pau's biometric
signature was recorded.
PHLOX: Undoubtedly another fabrication.
TUCKER: But look, the guard recognised whoever it was. And that guard
is your patient.
PHLOX: Corporal Askwith?
TUCKER: He could be our only chance to identify who really planted the
bomb.
PHLOX: He's in a coma. His cranial injuries are substantial. I don't
expect him to recover.
REED: There must be a stimulant you can inject him with, something to
bring him around just for a few minutes.
PHLOX: There's only so much damage a human body can withstand.
TUCKER: I don't care about his body, Doc. We need what's in his mind.
[The Forge - night]
(The sehlat's cries keep Archer awake.)
ARCHER: Sounds like that Klingon opera Hoshi made us listen to.
(There's another sound, and the sehlat leaves. A voice calls up to
them.)
AREV: The path is safe again.
ARCHER: That's quite a trick.
AREV: You're a human.
ARCHER: Jonathan Archer.
AREV: Travelling with a Vulcan.
T'POL: T'Pol.
AREV: Curious.
(The pair climb down to him.)
ARCHER: May we ask your name?
AREV: Arev.
T'POL: That means desert wind.
AREV: Does it? Why are you here?
ARCHER: We could ask you the same thing.
AREV: I follow the path of Surak in meditation and study. And you?
ARCHER: I'm on a pilgrimage to study Surak and logic. T'Pol is my
teacher.
AREV: (to T'Pol) I welcome you to walk with me. (to Archer) But this is
no place for your kind. Turn back.
ARCHER: If it's all the same, I'll walk with you, too.
AREV: This desert's called The Forge for a reason. It will test you and
destroy you.
[The Forge - daylight]
(The three are walking on a rocky ridge above an
expanse of pink sand.)
AREV: The Plain of Blood. Some say Surak crossed this expanse when the
hot blood of battle still flowed green. But with logic, he cooled it.
T'POL: Captain, the reflected heat is too hot for you.
ARCHER: I'll stick to the sand-covered parts wherever I can.
(He offers his water bottle.)
T'POL: I won't need water for several more days.
ARCHER: You'd better protect your eyes from the glare.
T'POL: My inner eyelids will protect my vision. My species evolved on
this planet.
(The group walks on, and Archer is suffering.)
AREV: How long have you tried to understand Vulcan logic?
ARCHER: Ever since I met T'Pol.
AREV: Very well, student of Surak. Who said, Logic is the cement of our
civilisation with which we ascend from chaos using reason as our guide?
ARCHER: I'm new at this. You tell me.
AREV: Something more basic then. What's Kiri-kin-tha's First Law of
Metaphysics?
ARCHER: I'm familiar with Newton's First Law of Motion. I imagine
they're pretty much the same.
AREV: You haven't been truthful about your presence here.
ARCHER: Have you?
AREV: Vulcans do not lie.
ARCHER: I've dealt with the High Command. Vulcans can lie and cheat
with the best of them.
AREV: The High Command does not follow Surak's true path. No wonder you
humans are their allies.
(Arev walks on ahead)
T'POL: From the questions he asked you, I believe he is a Syrrannite.
And it's obvious that he doesn't trust us enough to take us to the
others.
ARCHER: That only leaves one option. We have to tell him what he wants
to know, the truth.
T'POL: It may be too late for that. Sand-fire!
(A dust storm is coming down the valley like a tidal wave. They run.)
[Sickbay]
TUCKER: This man's our only witness.
SOVAL: He's comatose, brain-damaged, and he's human. A mind-meld is
dangerous under the best of conditions, but under these
TUCKER: Look, I know Phlox says there aren't a lot of Vulcans who can
do this sort of thing, but you've got to know someone who could at
least try.
SOVAL: Those who do have the ability won't risk their careers by
publicly attempting what you suggest.
PHLOX: Most Vulcans see melding as deviant behaviour.
TUCKER: What's that got to do with it?
SOVAL: Evidence will solve this crime, not mind-melds.
TUCKER: What evidence? The DNA on the bomb was planted.
SOVAL: You can prove that?
PHLOX: I can.
TUCKER: Ambassador, I don't know what kind of pull it takes to mess
with DNA records on Vulcan, but I think we're looking at a deliberate
attempt to hide the truth.
SOVAL: You're suggesting a conspiracy.
PHLOX: One that cost forty three innocent lives.
TUCKER: Aren't they worth a little risk?
SOVAL: (sighs) The needs of the many. I can perform the meld.
[The Forge - daylight]
(The sand-fire is catching the runners, and
electricity is sparking out from it. Archer stumbles.)
T'POL: Captain.
(He gets up again. Arev has found a cave.)
AREV: Over here!
[Cave]
AREV: Help me with this. The sand-fire can still
reach us.
(They block the entrance with a stones. Arev
sees T'Pol's medallion.)
AREV:
I know this. How did you get this medallion?
T'POL: From my mother.
AREV: T'Les.
T'POL: You're a Syrrannite.
AREV: The daughter of T'Les serves on a human starship.
T'POL: When did you talk with her? Is she safe?
AREV: You're the human responsible for the destruction of the monastery
at P'Jem.
ARCHER: Is that going to be a problem?
AREV: The High Command defiled P'Jem when they used it to spy on
Andoria. You exposed their hypocrisy.
ARCHER: You seem to know a lot about us. I'm guessing that means you
know why we're here.
AREV: Your mother is safe with the others, at the T'Kareth sanctuary.
It's not far. I'll guide you both there when the storm has passed.
[Sickbay]
SOVAL: I don't know if this has ever been attempted
with a human before.
(He puts his fingers on Askwith's face, then glares at Tucker to stop
looking over his shoulder.)
SOVAL: My mind to your mind. Our minds are one. Our thoughts are
joined. Yes.
(Flashes of the Embassy check point.)
SOVAL: I see what you see. The embassy. I'm at my station. At your
station. So many new people arriving for the summit. I don't recognise
them all, but some I know. A package. That's all right. I don't need to
see it. Go right through. Who are you? Who?
(Suddenly he disconnects from Askwith.)
TUCKER: Ambassador. What'd you see?
[Cave]
(The group share a meal.)
ARCHER: How long do these sand-fire storms usually last?
AREV: A day. Perhaps two. I've never seen one this strong. But we're
safe here, and we're in no hurry.
ARCHER: Maybe we should be.
T'POL: The High Command believes the Syrrannites are responsible for
bombing the Earth embassy.
AREV: That's not our way.
ARCHER: They seem to think that it is. That you and your leader believe
in a corrupted version of Surak's teachings.
AREV: Did your mother tell you the story?
T'POL: Of the IDIC?
AREV: Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combination. Words that are a mere
shadow of its true meaning. (she hands it over) Surak tells us that the
story of the IDIC has no end. But it begins here, at Mount Seleya.
T'POL: Surak died on Mount Seleya.
AREV: His body, yes, but his katra was spirited away before the last
battle against those who marched beneath the Raptor's wings. Those who
wanted to return to the savage ways.
ARCHER: What's a katra?
T'POL: Syrrannites claim it's the essence of a Vulcan mind. That it can
be transferred from the body before death, then stored in some manner.
AREV: Some say Surak's katra was found, and now is carried by a
Syrrannite so all those who meld with him may touch Surak's mind.
ARCHER: Syrrannite's conduct mind-melding?
AREV: Surak tells us it is the heritage of every Vulcan. Even those who
don't believe in the practise.
[Conference room]
STEL: A witness?
TUCKER: The guard recognised the person who brought in the bomb we
found in the rubble.
STEL: The Syrrannite woman, T'Pau.
SOVAL: No. It was you.
STEL: I would like to interrogate this witness myself.
TUCKER: You're not getting anywhere near him.
V'LAS: Perhaps I could speak with the guard.
PHLOX: I'm afraid he's in no condition to be questioned. He's in a
coma.
V'LAS: Yet he provided an eyewitness account.
TUCKER: We accessed his memories through a mind-meld.
STEL: Telepathic evidence is inadmissible.
V'LAS: It's not evidence at all! You allowed this distasteful act to
take place?
SOVAL: I performed it.
V'LAS: Soval. You've shamed Vulcan and yourself. The law leaves me no
recourse. You'll be summoned to appear before the High Command to
account for your actions. Commander. Doctor.
[Cave]
AREV: At one time, the High Command was only
responsible for the exploration of space. But that's changed.
ARCHER: I've been told Vulcans have never been explorers.
AREV: I think you've been told many things about us that aren't true.
(The sand-fire blows a hole in the entrance.)
AREV: Reseal the entrance!
(As they gather the stones, T'Pol is hit by lightning.)
ARCHER: T'Pol!
(He tends to her.)
ARCHER: Easy, easy, easy.
AREV: (at the entrance) Listen. The storm is gaining strength.
(Then he is flung back by another lightning strike. Archer goes to
him.)
ARCHER: Arev.
AREV: You must carry it to Sanctuary.
ARCHER: Carry what?
(Arev puts his hand on Archer's face.)
AREV:
Tuluk to Vokau.
[Corridor]
TUCKER: You can't go back.
SOVAL: I'm not a fool, Commander. V'Las was involved with the attack on
your embassy. He's responsible for blaming it on the Syrrannites.
TUCKER: Then why turn yourself over to him?
SOVAL: It's the only chance I'll have to reach the rest of the High
Command.
TUCKER: What if they're all in on it? (silence) If you really want
humans and Vulcans to work together someday, you might start thinking
about trusting us.
SOVAL Peace and long life, Commander.
(The airlock closes between them.)
TUCKER: Right.
[Cave]
(Archer awakes to see T'Pol wiping his brow.)
ARCHER: Arev. (sees his body)
T'POL: Are you injured?
ARCHER: I'm fine. He said something in Vulcan. Vokau.
T'POL: Remember. Remember what?
ARCHER: I think he punched me. The storm's over?
T'POL: The patrol craft are flying again. They sound like they're
closing in on this
location.
ARCHER: He said we weren't far from the T'Kareth Sanctuary. We should
keep moving.
T'POL: After we bury him.
[The Forge - night]
(They are walking along a ridge, when two vapour
trails pass overhead.)
ARCHER: They're following a grid search pattern. No sensors, but they
can still make visual contact. We have to find cover before the sun
comes up. That way.
T'POL: There's nothing there.
ARCHER: That's where the Syrrannites are.
T'POL: How do you know?
(They head down a gully.)
ARCHER: (refusing water) I'm good for a few more days.
T'POL: Captain, you're not Vulcan.
ARCHER: Right.
(He drinks.)
T'POL: It's almost dawn. We need to find someplace to hide.
ARCHER: No. Over here.
(A rock face.)
T'POL: That won't help us.
(He walks through the rock face, and T'Pol follows.)
[T'Kareth Sanctuary]
ARCHER: Don't resist.
T'POL: What do you mean?
(They are pounced on by an armed group.)

The Enterprise Transcripts - Awakening
Awakening
 Original Airdate: 26 Nov, 2004
  ARCHER
[OC]: Previously, on Enterprise
 FORREST [United
Earth Embassy]: We only want to be your partners, to work
together in common cause.
(BOOM!)
ARCHER [OC]: Admiral Forrest has been killed.
PHLOX [Sickbay]: The
DNA on the bomb's controls was left by this woman, T'Pau.
SOVAL [Corridor]: The
answers you need are on Vulcan, and however far you have to take this
investigation, you have my support.
T'POL [Ready room]: This
is a desert called the Forge. The route's the one Surak supposedly
followed.
TUCKER [Conference room]: The
guard recognised the person who brought in the bomb we found in the
rubble.
STEL: T'Pau.
SOVAL: No. It was you.
ARCHER [Cave]: What's
a katra?
T'POL: Syrrannites claim it's the essence of a Vulcan mind.
(Over the shot of the dying Arev grabbing Archer's face.)
T'POL [OC]: That it can be transferred from the body before death.
SOVAL [Corridor]:
V'Las was involved with the attack on your embassy. He's responsible
for blaming it on the Syrrannites.
[Vulcan High Command]
V'LAS: Before we announce our decision, is there
anything you wish to say?
SOVAL: My actions were taken in the best interest of Vulcan and the
High Command.
V'LAS: Keeping secrets from us is in our best interest?
SOVAL: Had I revealed my abilities as a melder, my years of service
would not have been possible.
KUVAK: Your accomplishments have been noteworthy.
V'LAS: They don't justify deception.
SOVAL: Deception has never been a stranger to this room.
V'LAS: I caution you.
SOVAL: One of our own members was responsible for bombing the Earth
embassy. An act we tried to blame on the Syrrannites.
V'LAS: That assessment was correct. Our investigation of Stel has
revealed he's a Syrrannite.
SOVAL: I find that difficult to accept.
V'LAS: Numerous documents were discovered in his home. The evidence is
irrefutable. Syrrannites were responsible, and they'll be dealt with
accordingly. Regarding the matter at hand, your position is terminated
immediately. You're to surrender all classified materials to the
Security Directorate before leaving. I remind you that your loyalty
oath is still in effect. A violation of that oath
SOVAL: I'm aware of the penalty.
V'LAS: Good. Is there anything else you'd like to say?
SOVAL: There's a great deal that needs to be said, Excellency, but no
one's willing to listen.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary]
(Archer and T'Pol are brought in front of a
familiar young woman.)
T'PAU: Who are you?
ARCHER; I'm Jonathan Archer.
T'PAU: Captain of the Earth vessel. And you must be T'Pol. You are a
long way from Enterprise.
ARCHER: I'm here to find the person who bombed the Earth embassy. Her
name is T'Pau. And she looks a hell of a lot like you.
T'PAU: I am T'Pau.
ARCHER: You murdered my friend, along with forty other people.
T'PAU: I had nothing to do with the destruction of your embassy.
T'POL: The evidence says you did.
T'PAU: I haven't left this desert for two years. What does that tell
you about your evidence?
ARCHER: It tells me that you're lying!
T'PAU: You have a lot to learn about Syrrannites.
ARCHER: You have a lot to learn about humans. We don't sit back and do
nothing while our people are attacked.
T'PAU: No, you traverse vast wastelands based on false information.
What did you plan to do when you found me, place me under arrest?
ARCHER: Something like that.
T'PAU: It seems everything I've heard about your species is accurate.
T'POL: Mother.
T'LES: I'm pleased to see that you're all right.
T'POL: We have a great deal to talk about.
T'LES: Agreed.
T'PAU: You told them where to find us.
T'LES: Yes.
T'PAU: Is there anyone else with you?
ARCHER: No.
T'PAU: To have crossed the Forge by yourselves, with the sand-fire
storms this time of year
T'POL: We met a Syrrannite. He helped us find shelter.
T'PAU: Who was this person?
ARCHER: His name was Arev.
T'POL: He was struck down by an electrical charge.
ARCHER: He didn't make it.
T'PAU: He's dead? Are you certain his name was Arev?
ARCHER: That's what he told us.
T'PAU: His true name was Syrran. He was our leader.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary - room]
(T'Pol and Archer are hustled into a room with bars
in the windows, and the door is locked from outside. Archer staggers
and leans against the wall.)
T'POL: Captain, are you all right?
ARCHER: I'm okay. Right before Arev died, he grabbed me. He put his
hand on my forehead. I felt something inside my head.
T'POL: Do you think he was trying to meld with you?
ARCHER: I don't know. But ever since, I haven't been myself.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary]
T'PAU: You put us all in danger. What if they'd
been followed?
T'LES: I only wanted her to know I was safe.
T'PAU: You could've accomplished that without revealing our location.
T'LES: I can't change what I've done. She doesn't deserve imprisonment.
I want her released.
T'PAU: Not until we've confirmed their story.
T'LES: My daughter wouldn't lie.
T'PAU: She's not merely your daughter. She's a member of Starfleet, and
Starfleet is allied with the High Command. They'll both remain where
they are until I'm satisfied they can be trusted. Search patrols are
flying day and night.
T'LES: They're the least of our worries now.
T'PAU: If Syrran is dead, then everything we've worked for is lost.
[Ready room]
TUCKER: I can't believe they threw you out. Just
because you helped us?
SOVAL; I knew the risks.
TUCKER: There's got to be some way you can fight this.
SOVAL; I could protest, but it wouldn't accomplish anything. V'Las
isn't one to change his mind.
TUCKER: Who the hell put him in charge, anyway?
SOVAL: Our society rewards merit. V'Las has demonstrated a singular
talent for governing.
TUCKER: What are you going to do now?
SOVAL: You're referring to my career? I haven't given it much thought.
There's something more important we need to discuss. Have you made
contact with T'Pol or your Captain?
TUCKER: We can't reach them and they can't reach us.
SOVAL: V'Las is determined to wipe out the Syrrannites. He's
particularly intent on destroying their encampment in the Forge.
TUCKER: Where the captain and T'Pol are headed.
SOVAL: They may be in grave danger.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary]
(T'Pol is brought to her mother.)
T'LES: You must have questions for me.
T'POL: I can't understand how you could join these people.
T'LES: I've been growing disillusioned with Vulcan society for some
time. When I was forced to resign from the Academy, I began seriously
to question my beliefs.
T'POL: And this is where you came for answers?
T'LES: Syrrannites believe that Vulcans have strayed from the teachings
of Surak. Considering what the High Command has done in recent years,
the listening station at P'Jem, the suppression of dissent, our
position isn't so hard to accept.
T'POL: You could have told me all this when I came to visit.
T'LES: The High Command was just beginning to hunt down suspected
Syrrannites. I was afraid I would be next. I wanted to keep you out of
it. I know your marriage to Koss was for my sake. To help me regain my
post.
T'POL: I don't want your apologies, Mother. I want you to come back
with me.
T'LES: I can't do that.
T'POL: When you gave me that map, you knew I'd try to find you.
T'LES: I thought that if you could see what we were trying to
accomplish
T'POL: That I'd understand? That I'd join you?
T'LES: I held out that hope, yes. It's possible I was being foolish.
T'POL: Extremely.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary - room]
(Archer is pacing the sandy floor, when suddenly he
is in the Sanctuary at a different time, with explosions in the
distance.)
SURAK: War is taking its toll. Vulcan is tearing itself apart.
ARCHER: Who are you?
SURAK: You know who I am, Captain. So much death. Hard to believe this
will become known as the Time of Awakening.
ARCHER: That was eighteen hundred years ago. This doesn't feel like a
dream.
SURAK: You're seeing the past through my eyes.
ARCHER: Syrran did something to me before he died.
SURAK: He chose you. You don't trust Vulcans, Captain. And, given your
experiences with them, I can't say I blame you. The culture you've come
to know isn't the one I helped to create. My people have strayed, and
someone must restore them to the path.
ARCHER: You've got the wrong man.
SURAK: Sorry, Captain. There's an Earth expression, We're stuck with
each other. Don't fight what's been given to you. Open your mind and
your heart and the way will become clear.
T'POL: Captain. Captain?
(Archer opens his eyes, and he's in the cell.)
[High Command]
V'LAS: We've pinpointed their location near the
northeastern border of the Forge.
KUVAK: How accurate is this information?
V'LAS: It's based on data collected by search patrols. They've been
conducting missions for several days. We're going to bombard the camp
with photonic weapons.
KUVAK: Our goal isn't to exterminate these people.
V'LAS: Our goal is to maintain order.
KUVAK: They're in the deep desert. What possible harm could they do us?
V'LAS: They've already destroyed an embassy.
KUVAK: Eventually, they're going to have to leave the Forge, and when
they do, we can apprehend them with little or no loss of life.
V'LAS: It's very likely that Syrran himself is inside the compound.
With one decisive thrust, we can cripple this insurgency, perhaps end
it. We can't let an opportunity like this pass us by.
KUVAK: A surgical strike could minimize the loss of life.
V'LAS: The geomagnetic anomalies make a precision attack impossible.
This is the only way. We'll begin preparations immediately.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary - courtyard]
T'PAU: This man, did he tell you his name?
ARCHER: He seemed to think I knew who he was.
T'LES: Did you?
ARCHER: It was Surak.
T'PAU: We believe you.
T'LES: Syrran possessed the katra of Surak.
T'POL: Katras are nothing more than a myth.
T'LES: I used to think that, until I learned to open up my mind to
other possibilities.
T'PAU: If Syrran knew he was close to death, he would have tried to
transfer the katra to someone else.
ARCHER: I was near him when he died.
T'PAU: There is only one way to be certain. I have to meld with you.
ARCHER: I've had my fill of mind-melds.
T'PAU: The prospect doesn't appeal to me, either. I've never melded
with a human before. Your unchecked emotions will no doubt prove
distasteful. However, I ask your indulgence.
(Archer turns to face her.)
T'PAU: My mind to your mind. My thoughts to your thoughts. Our minds
are merging.
BOTH: Our minds are one.
T'PAU: We're in the desert. There's a storm. We find refuge in a cave.
Sand-lightning. Our minds are not alone. There's someone else here with
us. I sense his presence.
(She breaks the meld.)
T'LES: T'Pau?
T'PAU: He has the katra.
[Situation room]
SOVAL: We can trigger a malfunction in this
satellite's imaging node. It'll take six minutes for the central
processor to correct the error.
TUCKER: That should be enough time to slip through the net. Won't they
wonder what caused the glitch?
SOVAL: Errors occur frequently near the Forge. It shouldn't raise
suspicion.
TUCKER: Mind if I ask you something? Why are you doing this? I never
got the impression you cared that much about humans. Seems like you
were always finding something new to complain about.
SOVAL: I lived on Earth for more than thirty years, Commander. In that
time, I developed an affinity for your world and its people.
TUCKER: You did a pretty good job of hiding it.
SOVAL: Thank you.
TRAVIS [OC]: Launch Bay to Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: Go ahead, Travis.
[Launch bay]
(It's more like a welding shop, with sparks flying
everywhere.)
TRAVIS: We should be ready within the hour.
TUCKER: [OC]: What about helm control?
TRAVIS: I've rigged up a stick-and-rudder system. It'll get us where we
want to go,
[Situation room]
TRAVIS [OC]: But I can't promise a smooth ride.
TUCKER: Just don't tell Malcolm about that part until you're underway.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary - room]
T'POL: Centuries ago, a set of Katric Arks were
discovered at the P'Jem monastery.
ARCHER: Katric Arks?
T'POL: Polycrystalline vessels, allegedly used by ancient Vulcans to
preserve katras. They were scanned, analyzed. One of the scientists
even attempted to meld with them. They found nothing to indicate the
presence of a katra.
ARCHER: The Vulcan Science Academy was just as sceptical about time
travel.
T'POL: Do you really believe you possess the living spirit of Surak
inside you? A man who died eighteen hundred years ago?
ARCHER: Not when you put it like that.
T'POL: There is a logical explanation.
ARCHER: I'm listening.
T'POL: Syrran melded with you before he died. What you're experiencing
is the residue of his thoughts.
ARCHER: So I'm suffering from a mind-meld hangover?
T'POL: I wouldn't characterise it quite that way, but essentially.
ARCHER: It feels like more than that.
T'POL: You have no basis for comparison. You've never undergone a
mind-meld before.
ARCHER: Seeing Surak is only a part of it. I could swear I've been here
before, in this sanctuary. It's like coming back to the house you grew
up in.
T'POL: Syrran spent a great deal of time here.
ARCHER: Let's say you're right, and it was just a mind-meld. He still
put something in my head. And I want it taken out.
T'POL: That may not be possible.
[Bridge]
TUCKER: What can we do for you?
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: Where is your captain?
TUCKER: He's indisposed at the moment. Can I help you?
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: The investigation of the embassy bombing is
nearly complete.
TUCKER: You have a suspect.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: The evidence against him and the Syrrannites is
compelling. There's no longer any need for your presence here.
TUCKER: If it's all the same to you, we'd like to stick around.
[High Command]
V'LAS: We'd prefer you didn't. This is an internal
matter. We'll keep Starfleet apprised if there are any subsequent
developments.
TUCKER [on screen]: Excellency.
V'LAS: Again, you have my deepest sympathy for your loss.
[Bridge]
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: All of Vulcan grieves with
you.
TUCKER: With all respect, we aren't leaving. Not until we know exactly
what happened.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: I've also contacted Admiral Gardner. I'm sure
you'll be hearing from him soon. A pleasant journey. (ends
transmission)
TUCKER: Son of a bitch hung up on us.
HOSHI: Should I try to get him back?
[T'Kareth Sanctuary]
T'LES: No one here has ever performed this ritual.
T'PAU: I've studied it for some time. I believe I can conduct it
successfully.
T'LES: You'd not only be placing Surak's katra in jeopardy, you could
kill Archer.
T'PAU: The risks are acceptable.
T'LES: I doubt Surak would agree.
T'PAU: What alternative would you suggest? That we follow this human?
T'LES: I believe your prejudice toward humans is clouding your
judgment.
T'PAU: You question my logic?
T'LES: Syrran chose to place the katra in Archer. He must have had his
reasons, even if we don't understand them.
T'PAU: The reason is obvious. He was dying. Your daughter couldn't
reach him in time. He had to choose Archer.
T'LES: That may be, but we do have a choice. Now, for the sake of
everyone involved, I ask you to reconsider.
T'PAU: I've made my decision. I'll perform the procedure in one hour.
T'LES: And if Archer dies?
T'PAU: I won't sacrifice our future to protect the life of one human.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary - room]
ARCHER: You know, I'm the one with a Vulcan ghost
in his head, depending on who you believe. But I don't feel half as bad
as you look.
T'POL: I'm considering our options.
ARCHER: At least we know your mother's okay.
T'POL: She's joined a violent cult. She's not okay.
ARCHER: I don't think these people had anything to do with the embassy.
T'POL: You sound convinced.
ARCHER: Let's just say it's more than a gut feeling.
(a guard opens the door, T'Pau and T'Les enter)
T'PAU: We've come to a decision. The katra must be removed.
ARCHER: I can't argue with that.
T'PAU: There's a procedure, a ritual. It will transfer the katra to
another person.
T'LES: It's not without risk.
T'PAU: Vulcan neurology is exceptionally resilient, but a human's
T'LES: The shock to your nervous system will be severe. It could kill
you.
T'POL: You must decline.
T'PAU: We're not offering a choice.
T'POL: You'd do this by force?
T'PAU: We'd prefer that you undertake the ritual willingly. It will
stand a better chance of success. However, if force is required, we
won't hesitate to use it.
ARCHER: Let's get started.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: It's my call.
[Corridor]
TUCKER: Admiral Gardner followed the Vulcan line
straight down the middle. He wants us out of here yesterday.
REED: Did you tell him about the Captain and T'Pol?
TUCKER: I left that part out.
SOVAL: Enterprise was supposed to leave orbit an hour ago. V'Las is not
a patient man.
TUCKER: There's not a whole lot he can do about it.
[Launch bay]
(the three walk in)
TUCKER: Hell of a job, Travis.
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir.
TUCKER: Just find them and bring them back. No sightseeing along the
way.
TRAVIS: Understood.
TUCKER: We've got a recon satellite to jam.
[High Command]
VULCAN [OC]: Enterprise hasn't left orbit. They're
maintaining a stationary position above the Forge.
V'LAS: Keep monitoring them.
VULCAN [OC]: Yes, Excellency.
V'LAS: We can't proceed with the operation while the Earth ship is
there.
KUVAK: You're concerned about witnesses.
V'LAS: Gardner gave them an order to leave. I heard the transmission.
KUVAK: So we're now monitoring their communications?
V'LAS: They wouldn't disobey an order without a reason. I intend to
find out what it is.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary - night]
(Archer kneels for the ritual.)
T'PAU: Passed down through the ages, the katra of Surak, father of all
we hold true, lives on in this man. Let it now live on in me.
(She stands behind Archer and puts her hands on his forehead, then
starts speaking in Vulcan. Archer seems to be in pain, then we join him
in another vision.)
ARCHER: Surak.
SURAK: Good to see you again, Captain. My appearance must be quite
disconcerting. I apologise.
ARCHER: Radiation sickness?
SURAK: We're paying a heavy price for our foolishness. Logic has not
won this day, but this day won't last forever. Logic is at the heart of
every Vulcan. Even as the ashes fall, my people are discovering a new
way. You can accomplish what Syrran could not.
ARCHER: But Syrran
SURAK: Was a Vulcan, and you're human. Which means you are untouched by
a culture that can no longer see its own imminent destruction. We
cannot let what happened to the Vulcans of my time take place again.
Find what my people have lost. Find the Kir'Shara.
(Surak dies, the telepathic link is broken.)
T'POL: Captain.
T'PAU: I failed. Surak chooses to remain where he is.
[Bridge]
(The modified shuttlepod has launched from
Enterprise.)
SOVAL: (at Reed's station) The satellite's been disabled. You've got
six minutes to get through.
TUCKER: Travis, it's all yours.
[Shuttlepod]
(They're having a bumpy ride.)
REED: Probably should've skipped breakfast this morning.
[Bridge]
SOVAL: They're through.
HOSHI; We're losing contact.
[Shuttlepod]
TRAVIS: These thermals are only going to get
stronger.
(They're hit by weapons fire.)
REED: That was no thermal.
(two Vulcan patrol ships are attacking them)
REED: The plasma-cannons are still working, but I can't say the same
for the targeting sensors.
TRAVIS: We must be getting close to the geomagnetic field.
REED: It doesn't seem to be affecting them.
TRAVIS: They must have better shielding.
REED: I'll have to aim manually. Can you get us on their tail?
(one quick loop-the-loop later, the pod shoots at the Vulcans)
REED: How are they still below us?
TRAVIS: We've lost part of the starboard wing.
REED: We have to abort.
TRAVIS: I think I can get us down.
REED: You won't be able to get us back up.
TRAVIS: Thrusters are offline. We'll have to fire the chemical rockets.
Hang on.
[Bridge]
HOSHI: They've been fired on. They took damage, but
they're heading back to Enterprise.
TUCKER: I guess six minutes wasn't enough.
SOVAL: They must've been monitoring us.
HOSHI: Three ships closing on our position. SATO: We're being hailed.
It's Administrator V'Las.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: Why did you launch a shuttlepod?
TUCKER: Why the hell did you fire on it?
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: You had no authorisation. Answer the question.
TUCKER: We're looking for our Captain.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: Archer's on the surface?
TUCKER: He's in the Forge, searching for the Syrrannites.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: You were ordered to leave orbit.
SOVAL: I advised them to stay.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: I assume you assisted in disabling the security
satellite.
SOVAL: I gave them the code.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: Commander Tucker, you're to break orbit
immediately.
TUCKER: We're not leaving without the Captain.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: You will leave immediately, or I'll order my
ships to open fire.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary - room]
(T'Pol is mopping Archer's fevered brow, as he lies
out cold on the floor where he collapsed after the meld.)
T'LES: How is he?
T'POL: His breathing has stabilised, but his fever is still high.
T'LES: He agreed to the ritual.
T'POL: If he hadn't, you would have forced him. You claim that Surak's
teachings have been corrupted by the High Command, but you're no
different.
T'LES: There is a profound difference.
T'POL: You deceive yourself.
T'LES: T'Pol.
T'POL: I shouldn't have come here looking for you, and I don't want
anything more to do with you.
T'LES: If that's your wish.
ARCHER: How long have I been out?
T'POL: More than three hours.
ARCHER: I feel like I just pulled my head out of a plasma relay.
T'POL: You should rest.
(he sees a tunnel in the rocks and goes towards it)
ARCHER: The Kir'Shara.
T'LES: What do you know about it?
ARCHER: It was important to Surak, and it's in there.
T'POL: What's a Kir'Shara?
T'PAU: An artefact. Syrran led us here to find it.
T'LES: If he knows where it is.
T'PAU: Telescopes have sighted three Vulcan cruisers in orbit over the
Forge.
T'LES: The High Command knows we're here. We should evacuate
immediately.
T'PAU: Give the order.
(T'Les leaves.)
ARCHER: I can find it.
[Bridge]
(Explosions are going off nearby.)
HOSHI: That one missed us by twenty metres.
TUCKER: Tactical Alert. Polarise hull plating. How many warning shots
do Vulcans usually fire?
SOVAL: (at T'Pol's station) None.
HOSHI: V'Las.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: I'm running out of patience, Commander.
TUCKER: We've been over this. Our Captain and First Officer are down
there.
V'LAS [on viewscreen]: We'll make sure they're returned to you. Break
orbit. Now. (ends transmission)
TUCKER: You really think he'll do it?
SOVAL: V'Las will do what whatever it takes to accomplish his goal.
[High Command]
KUVAK: Vulcan and Earth have been allies for a
hundred years.
V'LAS: Syrrannites must have seen our ships by now. If they evacuate
into the Forge, they'll be extremely hard to track. We can't wait any
longer. Drive Enterprise from orbit. Use all necessary force.
VULCAN [OC]: Yes, Excellency.
[Bridge]
(Enterprise comes under direct attack.)
TUCKER: Phase-cannons, return fire.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary]
T'LES: The Vulcan ships are firing on Enterprise.
T'PAU: We could be next. Take charge of the evacuation. We'll meet you
on the Forge as soon as we can.
T'LES: You can't stay here.
T'PAU: I've spent two years searching for the artefact. If there's a
chance of finding it.
T'LES: T'Pol?
T'POL: I'm staying.
T'PAU: Go.
(Archer, T'Pau and T'Pol head off down the tunnel/)
[Bridge]
(Enterprise is hopelessly outgunned, and taking
damage.)
TUCKER: Re-route emergency power to phase-cannons.
HOSHI: Hull breach on C Deck. They're reporting casualties. V'Las is
hailing. Audio only.
TUCKER: Put him through.
V'LAS [OC]: You're hopelessly outgunned, weapons are offline, engines
failing. Don't force me to destroy your ship.
SOVAL: He's right. We should withdraw. Our deaths won't help Captain
Archer or T'Pol.
TUCKER: Get us the hell out of here.
[High Command]
V'LAS: The moment Enterprise is beyond scanner
range begin bombardment of the compound.
VULCAN [OC]: Yes, Excellency.
[Tunnels]
(Archer leads the way with a flaming torch, and
they come across mummies propped against the walls.)
ARCHER: T'Klaas. He was a student of Surak, one of the first Kolinahr
masters.
T'POL: There's no inscription, nothing to indicate his bloodline. How
do you know his name?
ARCHER: We're getting close.
(They hear thuds.)
T'PAU: They've begun their assault.
(The group moves on.)
ARCHER: It's here.
(They are standing in front of a circular carved door. Archer presses
three panels in particular ways, and it opens. Archer enters, takes the
slender three-sided pyramid object from it's plinth and hands it to
T'Pau.)
T'PAU: I had my doubts whether it really existed.
(A big explosion nearly knocks them off their feet. Archer
catches the Kir'Shara as it falls from T'Pau's hands.)
ARCHER: Let's
go. This way.
[High Command]
(As the bombardment of the sanctuary area knocks
out the holographic projector, revealing the torch light and
courtyards.)
V'LAS: Report.
VULCAN [OC]: Geomagnetic interference. We can't get a target lock.
V'LAS: Blanket the area.
(The Kir'Shara fellowship make their way out through collapsing tunnels
onto a ridge above the main area, where they have a clear view of the
destruction of historical site.)
[High Command]
VULCAN [OC]: The sanctuary has been destroyed.
V'LAS: Comb the desert. Make sure there are no survivors.
VULCAN [OC]: Affirmative.
KUVAK: You're presiding over a massacre.
V'LAS: We are eliminating a threat.
[T'Kareth Sanctuary]
(T'Pau dresses a wound on T'Pol's leg.)
T'PAU: Are you all right?
T'POL: I'm fine.
T'PAU: We should keep moving.
(They are about to head off, when T'Pol hears a moan.)
T'POL: Captain.
(They find a body, and a survivor of the bombardment.)
T'LES: I was afraid you were still inside.
T'POL: It's all right. We found the Kir'Shara.
T'LES: You have always struggled so with your emotions. I came here, I
did all this to help you.
T'POL: (close to tears) I don't understand.
T'LES: You will.
T'POL: Mother.
T'LES: I've always been so proud of you, my T'Pol.
(T'Les dies in her arms.)
T'POL: Mother.
(T'Pol cries.)
[Ready room]
SOVAL: I understand we suffered casualties.
TUCKER: Injuries, two of them serious.
SOVAL: I share your concern about Captain Archer and T'Pol.
TUCKER: They've been in tough jams before.
What does the High Command have against the Syrrannites? They went to a
lot of trouble to frame them for the embassy bombing.
SOVAL: The Syrrannites believe violence to be antithetical to Surak's
teachings.
TUCKER: So they're pacifists.
SOVAL: V'Las considers that a dangerous mindset, particularly now.
TUCKER: What do you mean?
SOVAL: The High Command is planning to attack Andoria.
TUCKER: Wait, wait. Vulcan and Andoria signed a peace treaty two years
ago. Captain Archer helped negotiate it.
SOVAL: Vulcan Intelligence claims the Andorians are developing a
weapon, possibly based on Xindi technology.
TUCKER: You don't believe it.
SOVAL: I suspect V'Las is using the claim to advance an agenda. He's
persuaded the High Command to launch a preemptive strike.
TUCKER: He's going to start an interstellar war.
SOVAL: One that could devastate Andoria and Vulcan and eventually
involve other worlds, including Earth.
[Bridge]
TUCKER: Set a course for Andoria.
REED: Andoria?
TUCKER: Maximum warp.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Kir'Shara
Kir'Shara
 Original Airdate: 3 Dec, 2004
  T'POL
[OC]: Previously, on Enterprise
 ARCHER [OC] [United
Earth Embassy] : (as
the building goes BOOM!) Admiral Forrest has been killed.
V'LAS [High Command]: (to
Soval) The Syrrannites were responsible and they'll be dealt with
accordingly. Your position is terminated immediately.
ARCHER [Archer's vision]: Surak.
SURAK: You're seeing the past through my eyes. The culture you've come
to know isn't the one I helped to create.
ARCHER [OC]: Syrran did something to me before he died.
SURAK [OC]: He chose you.
T'PAU [T'Kareth Sanctuary]: He has
Surak's katra.
TUCKER [Ready room]: We
can't reach them, and they can't reach us.
SOVAL: They may be in grave danger.
SURAK [Archer's second vision]: Find
what my people have lost. Find the Kir'Shara.
V'LAS [High Command]:
Blanket the area. Use all necessary force. Make sure there are no
survivors.
(The Sanctuary is blown to pieces.)
KUVAK: You're presiding over a massacre.
SOVAL [Ready room]: The
High Command is planning to attack Andoria.
TUCKER: He's going to start an interstellar war.
TUCKER [Bridge]:
Set a course for Andoria. Maximum warp.
T'POL [OC]: And now the conclusion.
[High Command]
V'LAS: The Andorians have deployed most of their
fleet in defensive positions around Paan Mokar.
KUVAK: We gave them that planet when we signed the treaty. Why would
they move their forces there?
V'LAS: They believe we're preparing to retake it. We've been using
unmanned probes to generate false warp signatures in that system.
KUVAK: Why weren't we informed of this?
V'LAS: It's possible that Andorian agents have penetrated the High
Command. It's necessary to limit access to this information. Our forces
are actually stationed here, preparing to launch an invasion of
Andoria.
KUVAK: There are members of the Council who are not convinced an
invasion is necessary at this time.
V'LAS: We know they have the Xindi technology. You've all seen the
data.
KUVAK: Data can be falsified.
V'LAS: We received this sensor telemetry two days ago. It was recorded
by the Andorian ship that stole the Xindi prototype. (The desk screen shows a small moon being blasted to pieces by a weapon
- the proving ground test from last season.)
Our operatives tell us the prototype was taken back to Andoria, where
it was disassembled. We have reason to believe the Imperial Guard plans
to equip their vessels with similar weaponry.
KUVAK: Do you have evidence of this?
V'LAS: They didn't steal the prototype because they were merely
curious. I'm certain of one thing. Sooner or later, the Andorians will
make use of this technology. Is it logical for us to wait for that day?
[The Forge - night]
(The fellowship of the Kir'Shara are travelling
through rocky formations that look like tunnels.)
T'PAU: We've sent word to the Syrrannites in the mountains. They'll
care for the wounded.
ARCHER: How far to the capital?
T'PAU: Two days.
T'POL: We need to get back to Enterprise. Tell Starfleet what we've
learned about the embassy bombing.
ARCHER: We have a more important mission. We've to get this to the
capital.
T'POL: I don't understand.
T'PAU: The Kir'Shara contains Surak's original writings. It's the only
surviving record of his true teachings.
It would have an enormous impact on the High Command, and all of
Vulcan.
[Ready room]
REED: I've got two teams working on it. Both
launchers should be online in a few hours.
TUCKER: Anything else?
REED: Permission to speak freely? Admiral Gardner ordered us to return
to Earth, yet we've set a course for Andorian territory.
TUCKER: We are going back. We're just taking a small detour first.
REED: Have you told Starfleet you're planning to warn the Andorians?
TUCKER: No.
REED: Have you any idea what the Admiral will do when he finds out?
TUCKER: I'll save you a seat at my court-martial. Is there anything
else?
REED: The Vulcans have legitimate reasons for launching this strike. If
we alert the Andorians, we will be betraying our closest ally.
TUCKER: I'm trying to prevent a war, Malcolm. A war that Earth could
get draw into.
REED: With all due respect, sir, we shouldn't get involved.
TUCKER: We're already involved. (doorbell) Come in.
(Soval enters.)
TUCKER: That'll be all, Lieutenant.
REED: Sir?
TUCKER: Dismissed.
(Reed leaves, after giving Soval a close glare.)
SOVAL: You asked for me, Commander?
TUCKER: I've been thinking. There's no guarantee the Imperial Guard's
going to believe us. We've got no evidence your people are planning
this attack. But there is one Andorian who might trust us. At least he
does some of the time.
SOVAL: Commander Shran.
TUCKER: Problem is, I have no idea how to find him.
SOVAL: I may be able to help.
TUCKER: Good.
SOVAL: Lieutenant Reed appeared unsettled.
TUCKER: Some of the crew are wondering if I'm doing the right thing.
Can't say I blame them. I'm not so sure myself.
SOVAL: I have no doubt Captain Archer would pursue this same course of
action.
TUCKER: That's what I keep telling myself.
[Rock Tunnels]
T'POL: Enterprise will be scanning for us at the
transport coordinates. One of us should go there.
ARCHER: It's too dangerous. We're staying together.
T'POL: Taking the artefact to the High Command will accomplish nothing.
ARCHER: It might be the only thing that can stop the war.
T'POL: What war?
ARCHER: Between Vulcan and Andoria.
T'POL: We settled our dispute with the Andorians nearly two years ago.
ARCHER: V'Las was just stalling for time. He's been preparing a
large-scale attack ever since.
T'POL: Where did you get this information?
ARCHER: Where do you think?
T'POL: Assuming for the moment you possess Surak's katra, he's been
dead for centuries. How could he be aware of plans for a war?
ARCHER: Some of Syrran's memories must have been transferred in the
meld.
T'POL: Captain.
ARCHER: You think I've lost my mind?
T'POL: I'm not certain your mind is the one making these decisions. We
should return to the ship. T'Pau can take the artefact to the capital.
ARCHER: I was chosen for this.
T'POL: Chosen? Interesting choice of words.
ARCHER: If I were in your shoes, I'd be just as sceptical. I'm not
possessed, and I'm not delusional. There are forces at work on your
world right now, trying to undo everything Surak taught your people. If
we fail, Vulcan will be consumed by them. That's why have to get this
thing to the capital. And I'm going to need all three of us to try and
find
T'PAU: Archer! Don't move. (There are sparkly things in the rock walls
ahead.) T'PAU: Gallicite deposits. Are you in possession of anything metallic? (Archer takes out a wicked looking knife.)
ARCHER: Just this.
(She throws it towards the gallicite, and it gets zapped by multiple
electrical discharges.)
ARCHER: Thanks for the warning.
[High Command]
KUVAK: Our patrol has returned. They captured eight
Syrrannites from the sanctuary.
V'LAS: Was Syrran among them?
KUVAK: No. He is dead. The Syrrannites say that there were three other
survivors, including a human.
V'LAS: Archer.
KUVAK: They say that he is carrying the Kir'Shara.
V'LAS: The Kir'Shara never existed.
KUVAK: There are scholars who believe it does, and that it was hidden
in the Forge. The Syrrannites claim that they are following the true
path of Surak. If the Kir'Shara is real, it could prove them right.
V'LAS: It doesn't exist! You've been listening to Syrrannite
propaganda. That will be all, Minister.
(Kuvak storms off.)
V'LAS: Sublieutenant, order Major Talok to find the remaining
Syrrannites. We're dealing with radical insurgents. They're to be
eradicated. Do I make myself clear?
(the young officer nods and leaves)
[Bridge]
(Enterprise has arrived at a pretty blue nebula
with stars in it.)
SOVAL: Open a channel.
TUCKER: To who?
SOVAL: The nebula. This is Ambassador Soval. I've come on an urgent
mission. I must speak with Commander Shran. The High Command has
decrypted your security protocols. We're well aware that your task
force has been hiding in this nebula.
TUCKER: Maybe your information's out of date.
SOVAL: He's in there.
TUCKER: This is Commander Tucker of Enterprise. We've got some
information you're going to want to hear.
TRAVIS: Sir.
(Three ships appear on the viewscreen.)
HOSHI: We're being hailed.
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: Commander Tucker, you have a poor choice of
friends.
[Conference room]
SHRAN: An invasion?
SOVAL: That's correct.
SHRAN: We keep a very close eye on your fleet. We would know if the
High Command were preparing to attack.
SOVAL: V'Las has been assembling ships near Regulus, beyond the range
of your listening stations.
SHRAN: Your leaders may be fools, but they're not suicidal. They know
we will respond.
SOVAL: They were told you're adapting Xindi weaponry and that you're
planning to use it against Vulcan.
SHRAN: That's absurd! Captain Archer destroyed the Xindi prototype
before we could examine it.
SOVAL: That fact was conveniently omitted.
SHRAN: You people are so used to lying, you don't even tell the truth
to each other. How do I know you weren't sent here as a diversion?
SOVAL: You don't.
SHRAN: Do you have any idea what will happen when the Imperial Guard
retaliates? It will be a disaster for both our worlds.
SOVAL: Which is why you must convince them to intercept our fleet.
SHRAN: You're betraying your own people by telling me this.
SOVAL: I'm aware of that.
SHRAN: Why are you doing it?
SOVAL: The High Command is counting on the element of surprise. If they
meet resistance, I believe V'Las will be forced to call off the
invasion.
SHRAN: When does this invasion begin?
SOVAL: Soon.
SHRAN: That's the best you can give me, soon?
SOVAL: Yes.
SHRAN: Do you believe him, pinkskin?
TUCKER: I wouldn't be here if I didn't.
SHRAN: I'll need to consult with my superiors.
TUCKER: I suggest you do it fast.
[Vulcan - daytime]
(Another aircraft passes overhead, as Archer rests
in what little shade there is.)
T'POL: That's the fourth patrol today. There's an extensive security
grid around the capital. It's unlikely we'll get past it.
T'PAU: We'll find a way. Surak will help us. You don't believe in the
katra?
T'POL: It's irrelevant what I believe. The Captain could be permanently
injured if we don't get him to a doctor soon.
T'PAU: He doesn't need a physician, he needs a priest. One experienced
with katras.
T'POL: It's irrational that we're following someone in his state of
mind. What if he dies before we can get help? I apologise. My mother's
death has affected me more than I realised.
T'PAU: It was a great loss. We disagreed frequently, but I valued her
counsel. I could allow you to experience what she shared with me.
T'POL: You melded with her? I cannot meld.
T'PAU: I would initiate it.
T'POL: That's not what I mean. I was forced to participate in a meld
several years ago. I was infected with a neural disease.
T'PAU: Pa'nar Syndrome. Do you still suffer from it?
T'POL: There's no cure.
T'PAU: Another lie perpetrated by the High Command. Pa'nar has been
known since Surak's time. It's caused by melders who have been
improperly trained. One with great experience can correct the
neurological imbalance.
T'POL: Is there something you can do?
(T'Pau accepts the invitation to initiate a meld)
T'PAU: My mind to your mind. My thoughts to your thoughts. Our minds
are merging. Our minds are one.
[Shran's ship]
ANDORIAN [OC]: Bridge to Commander Shran.
SHRAN: This is Shran.
ANDORIAN [OC]: We've isolated the Vulcan's bio-signature. He's alone.
SHRAN: You're certain Enterprise won't detect the transport?
ANDORIAN [OC]: All they'll see is a brief energy surge. They'll think
it came from the nebula. Commander?
SHRAN: Energise when ready.
ANDORIAN [OC]: Yes, sir.
(Soval is beamed into an interrogation chair, and a gun is pointed at
him.)
SHRAN: Welcome aboard, Ambassador.
SOVAL: If you're expecting me to plead for mercy, you'll be waiting a
long time.
SHRAN: I simply want to know your fleet's actual location.
SOVAL: I've already given it to you.
SHRAN: Then consider this our way of confirming what you've told us.
You didn't expect the Imperial Guard to mobilise its entire fleet based
on nothing more than the word of one loyal Vulcan diplomat?
SOVAL: We spent weeks arguing over details in our treaty negotiations.
Did I ever mislead you?
SHRAN: No.
SOVAL: You must know that torture is rarely effective against Vulcans.
Our mental disciplines allow us to suppress pain.
SHRAN: Our security division has had a great deal of experience
extracting information from Vulcan operatives. This machine doesn't
cause physical discomfort. It uses a neuro-synaptic field to lower your
emotional threshold.
(Shran nods to the operator, a blue light comes on, and Soval reacts
which what looks like fear.)
SHRAN: How do you feel? I've seen Vulcans who were broken by this
device. They were never the same again. I have no desire to see that
happen to you. Where is your fleet?!
SOVAL: I told you. Our ships are assembling near Regulus. (The machine
is cranked up another notch.) SOVAL: Release me!
SHRAN: I can't. Not until I'm certain you've told us the truth.
SOVAL: Then I suggest you increase the setting and get this over with.
(Shran nods, and Soval screams.)
[Bridge]
TUCKER: What is it?
REED: The Ambassador seems to be missing.
HOSHI: He's not in his quarters or anywhere on D deck.
TUCKER: Tucker to Soval. Ambassador, please respond. Internal sensors.
Scan for his biosigns.
REED: He's not on board.
TUCKER: Scan the Andorian ships.
REED: There's a Vulcan signature on their lead ship.
TUCKER: Go to Tactical Alert. Open a channel. This is Commander Tucker.
We know Ambassador Soval's aboard your ship. I want to speak with him
now.
TRAVIS: Sir, the Andorians are moving toward the nebula.
TUCKER: Target Shran's ship. Disable the engines.
(One torpedo hits as the four ships fly into the fog.)
TRAVIS: Navigation just went offline.
HOSHI: It's the particle flux in the nebula, it's overloading the
sensors.
TRAVIS: I've lost them.
REED: Can we compensate for the flux?
TUCKER: It'll take a few hours. You have the Bridge.
[Vulcan]
(It must be night because Archer is carrying a
flaming torch again.)
T'POL: Captain, you need to rest.
ARCHER: Thanks, but I'll be fine.
T'POL: The atmosphere is thinner than you're used to. If you don't stop
soon, you'll collapse.
ARCHER: If you need a break, T'Pol, you should say so.
T'PAU: I'm going to scout ahead.
(She leaves them.)
T'POL: Have you had any more conversations with Surak?
ARCHER: Not in a couple of hours.
T'POL: Something's amusing?
ARCHER: Of all the people who could've carried this katra.
T'POL: I doubt you were Syrran's first choice.
ARCHER: Ever since the meld, I've felt more centred. It's hard to
explain. My whole life, I've never really understood Vulcans. Why they
work so hard to suppress their emotions. Now it all seems to make
sense. Next thing you know, I'll be taking up meditation.
T'POL: You might find it beneficial.
ARCHER: After we get back, maybe you'll want to take a closer look at
the Syrrannites' philosophy.
T'POL: Why?
ARCHER: It was important to your mother. There might be something to
it.
T'POL: There are many groups who claim to follow the true path of
Surak. I find no evidence that this one's any different.
ARCHER: I would've thought you'd be more sympathetic to their cause.
You never seemed too happy with the status quo around here.
T'POL: I may have had disagreements with the High Command, but that
doesn't mean I'm going to join a radical faction.
ARCHER: You signed up with Starfleet. A lot of Vulcans I've met
consider us a radical faction. As a scientist, I just thought you might
want to keep an open mind.
T'POL: This has nothing to do with science!
T'PAU: Am I interrupting?
T'POL: No.
[Shran's ship]
SOVAL: Let me out of here!
SHRAN: I can't. I'm sorry. Not yet.
SOVAL: I'll tear the antennae from your skull!
SHRAN: If this interrogation continues, your suppression system could
be permanently damaged. Tell me what I want to know!
SOVAL: Aren't you enjoying this, Commander? Have you imagined having me
in this chair many times?
SHRAN: That's not far from the truth. But after our rather lengthy
peace talks, I came to trust you.
SOVAL: Then trust me now!
SHRAN: You would never betray your people!
SOVAL: I'm trying to save them!
SHRAN: Where is your fleet?!
SOVAL: Do you know the story of Nirak?
SHRAN: What?
SOVAL: He was a soldier who lived a long time ago. He was standing
watch over the gates of the city of Gol and he saw a cloud on the
horizon moving toward him. He thought it was a sandstorm, so he told no
one. It was an army. They destroyed the city, but they let Nirak live.
His name now means fool in our language, just as yours will in
Andorian!
(The machine is turned up to maximum.)
[Vulcan]
(The fellowship are met by some men who jump out of
hiding and surround them.)
TALOK: Give the Kir'Shara to us. You won't be injured. This isn't your
world, human.
(They fight. Archer uses a sleeper grip on one, then displays
surprising ability with the lirpa. T'Pol gets knocked out and they have
to retreat up the rocks.) T'PAU: Archer!
TALOK: Surrender and you won't be harmed.
ARCHER: I'm not leaving her.
(But a second Vulcan disarms him so T'Pau pushes him down a rock tunnel
or lava tube and then dives after him.)
[Cave]
ARCHER: What the hell were you doing?
T'PAU: Protecting the Kir'Shara.
[Vulcan]
(T'Pol wakes up.)
TALOK: Where are they taking the Kir'Shara?
T'POL: Mount Seleya.
TALOK: Why?
T'POL: Because the artefact contains Surak's original writings. Only
the priests on Seleya can translate them.
TALOK: If you are deceiving me
T'POL: I am a Syrrannite. We don't lie.
(She is marched along, hands tied behind her back, until she falls to
her knees.)
T'POL: I need to rest.
TALOK: If you're attempting to delay us, it won't work. We'll find your
friends. (she refuses water from him) You've changed. I served under
you during the Tomed mission. You don't remember me.
T'POL: That's a very long time ago.
TALOK: You were a fine officer then. Why did you betray us? They must
have offered you something. Or perhaps you enjoy hiding bombs in
embassies?
T'POL: We weren't responsible.
TALOK: Two of my men were killed in the embassy explosion.
T'POL: You have been misled. Syrrannites are peaceful.
TALOK: I have spared your life because you were once my superior. Your
companions won't be so fortunate.
[Shran's ship]
ANDORIAN [OC]: Bridge to Commander Shran.
SHRAN: What is it?
ANDORIAN [OC]: The General is asking for an update on the
interrogation.
SHRAN: Tell him I'll contact him when I'm ready.
ANDORIAN [OC]: Acknowledged.
SHRAN: You find this amusing?
SOVAL: Ordinarily, I wouldn't, but because of this device
SHRAN: There are three higher settings on that panel. If I use them
SOVAL: You're afraid to injure me. If I were you, I'd leave that detail
out of your report to the General.
SHRAN: Where is your fleet?
SOVAL: I was a fool to think you'd listen. Perhaps the High Command was
right. We'll be better off when Andoria falls.
(The ship is hit by weapons fire.)
SHRAN: Report!
ANDORIAN [OC]: It's the Starfleet ship.
[Bridge]
REED: Direct hit to their shield generator.
TUCKER: See if you can get a lock on Soval.
[Shran's ship]
ANDORIAN [OC]: Should we return fire?
SOVAL: Are you going to make enemies of the humans as well?
SHRAN: Lieutenant, order our ships out of the nebula.
ANDORIAN [OC]: Commander?
SHRAN: And tell Enterprise we'll be returning the Ambassador shortly.
ANDORIAN [OC]: Understood.
SHRAN: Get that thing off of him.
[Vulcan - day]
(They've found the tracks of boots in the sand.)
T'PAU: They're heading east. Away from the capital. She's with them.
Where are you going?
ARCHER: To find my science officer. And I don't want to hear any
lectures about the needs of the many. I get enough of that crap from,
from T'Pol.
T'PAU: There's no logic to your plan. We have no weapons. If they take
the Kir'Shara from you, they'll destroy it.
ARCHER: I'm going to find her.
[Sickbay]
SHRAN: How is he?
TUCKER: You've got a lot of nerve pretending you give a damn.
SHRAN: I did what was necessary. Soval would understand.
PHLOX: He should be fine in another day or so.
TUCKER: He risked his life coming here, and you paid him back by
scrambling his neurons.
SHRAN: He's not the only one taking a risk. I just spoke with the
Imperial Guard. They're re-deploying our forces.
TUCKER: Now you believe him. What changed your mind?
SHRAN: A lesser man would've told me what I wanted to hear, even if it
wasn't true. There's been too much suspicion, too many lies, on both
sides. Our fleet will intercept the Vulcans at these coordinates. My
superiors believe it may be helpful if Enterprise were to join us.
[Vulcan]
(An animal screech rings out.)
TALOK: Sehlat.
(He sends his men through the rock formations, but we see it's actually
T'Pau imitating a sehlat, and she's lured them to a gallicite deposit.
With the two Vulcans out cold, Archer deals with Talok himself.)
ARCHER: My First Officer, where is she? What have you done with her?
TALOK: She's been taken to the High Command.
(Archer neck-pinches him into unconsciousness.)
T'PAU: Your technique has improved.
[High Command]
V'LAS: Welcome home, Subcommander.
T'POL: I no longer hold that rank.
V'LAS: Well, you may have joined Starfleet, but you're still Vulcan.
And subject to our laws. There are few crimes still punishable by
execution, but treason is one of them. (A beeping sound.) V'LAS: What is it?
KUVAK: Seven alien ships have taken position outside the Andorian
system. They are directly in the path of our fleet.
[Bridge]
REED: Are you sure this is wise? If the Vulcans
find us here, they might think we're siding with the Andorians. There's
no guarantee they won't fire on us.
TRAVIS: Sir, I'm reading a massive subspace distortion.
TUCKER: Hoshi?
HOSHI: It's the Vulcans. They'll be here in two hours. He's hailing us
again.
TUCKER: On screen.
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: Our sensors show twelve Vulcan cruisers
approaching.
TUCKER: When will the rest of your fleet get here?
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: They won't arrive in time. We're on our own.
[Vulcan]
(They reach the top of a rocky ridge overlooking
the capital city.)
ARCHER: I'm still not clear how the Kir'Shara's gonna stop a war.
T'PAU: V'Las can't govern without approval from the Council. The
existence of the Kir'Shara will persuade them to reconsider their
support.
ARCHER: I don't suppose they'll let us just walk into the High Command.
T'PAU: We can transport in, but we'll need access codes.
ARCHER: I know someone who might have them.
[Bridge]
(The Vulcan cruisers have just dropped out of warp.)
REED: The Vulcans are powering weapons. The Andorians are doing the
same.
TUCKER: Travis, put us between both fleets. If the Vulcans want to
start a war, they're going to have to get through us first.
HOSHI: It's Shran.
SHRAN [OC]: Commander, what do you think you're doing?
TUCKER: In case you hadn't noticed they outnumber us two to one.
SHRAN [OC]: Get back in formation!
TUCKER: I'm trying to buy us some time!
[High Command]
(They are watching the ship movements on the
tabletop display.)
KUVAK: The Andorians have more ships on the way.
V'LAS: They won't arrive for several hours.
KUVAK: You told us this strike would be a surprise. That there would be
minimal casualties on both sides. The Andorians are armed with standard
particle cannons. There is no evidence of Xindi technology.
Administrator, we have to call off this attack.
V'LAS: Our forces are committed. We can't turn back.
VULCAN [OC]: We're being hailed by the Starfleet ship.
TUCKER [OC]: This is Commander Tucker. Sorry to spoil your surprise,
but the Andorians know what you're planning.
[Bridge]
TUCKER: I suggest you turn your ships around now.
V'LAS [OC]: This doesn't concern Starfleet.
[High Command]
V'LAS: Leave the area immediately.
[Bridge]
TUCKER: I can't do that. The Andorians helped us
when Earth was under attack. We're just here to return the favour.
[High Command]
V'LAS: If you side with the Andorians, you'll be
fired upon.
TUCKER [OC]: I've already sent word to Admiral Gardner. If Enterprise
is destroyed, Starfleet's going to know who is responsible. (Vlas ends the transmission.)
V'LAS: Order our ships to engage the enemy
fleet.
KUVAK: Administrator, I can't allow this.
V'LAS: Sublieutenant. (The young man draws his weapon.) V@LASIf you attempt
to interfere again, I'll have you arrested.
[Bridge]
REED: The Vulcans, they're locking weapons.
TUCKER: On us?
REED: No, just the Andorians.
TUCKER: Stand by phase-cannons. Don't fire until I give the order.
(The Vulcans open fire, and the Andorians return it, accidentally
hitting Enterprise.)
REED: We're in the crossfire.
TUCKER: Hard about! Get us out of their weapons range!
HOSHI: One of the Andorian ships is in trouble. Their reactor's been
hit.
REED: A Vulcan cruiser's heading towards them.
TUCKER: See if you can get their attention.
[High Command]
VULCAN [OC]: The Earth vessel's opened fire on one
of our ships.
V'LAS: Destroy them.
[Bridge]
HOSHI: The cruiser's breaking off its attack.
TRAVIS: We're being targeted.
(Big bangs.)
TUCKER: Evasive starboard. Full impulse. Malcolm!
REED: We're not making a dent in their shields.
(A pair of Andorian ships drive the Vulcans away.)
HOSHI: Shran's hailing.
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: Tell Archer that's two he owes me.
[High Command]
(Two figures enter the chamber, and throw back
their hoods to reveal - Archer and T'Pau. Kuvak uses the distraction to
neck-pinch the Sublieutenant and grab his weapon.)
V'LAS: Contact Security.
KUVAK: Stay where you are.
ARCHER: We need to have a talk.
T'PAU: Administrator, it is agreeable to see you again.
V'LAS: This woman is an anarchist, Captain. Whatever she's told you
isn't the truth.
ARCHER: T'Pau didn't bomb our embassy. You did.
V'LAS: The evidence is conclusive.
ARCHER: Evidence your people gave us. The bombing was an excuse to
round up the Syrrannites, make certain they'd never find this.
(He places the elegant pyramid on the table.)
KUVAK: Is that? (T'Pau nods.)
V'LAS: The Kir'Shara's a myth!
(Archer presses the correct places on each of the three sides, and the
Kir'Shara projects Surak's writings as a hologram around the room.)
[Bridge]
REED: Hull plating's gone.
TUCKER: Torpedoes!
REED: The launchers aren't responding.
TUCKER: Where the hell is Shran?
REED: The Vulcans are keeping him busy. Looks like we really are on our
own.
[High Command]
V'LAS: Holographic trickery. This proves nothing.
KUVAK: The artefact must be examined in detail.
V'LAS: No.
T'PAU: Quantum dating will confirm that it's from the time of Surak.
V'LAS: You can't trust her! She'd do anything to spread her deviant
beliefs. You've spent years trying to subvert me.
T'PAU: The Kir'Shara will show us our true path.
V'LAS: (somewhat angry) They'd kill us all if they had the chance! It
must be destroyed.
(As he advances menacingly on the Kir'Shara, Kuvak shoots him.)
KUVAK: This is Minister Kuvak. Get me the Fleet Commander immediately.
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: I've lost helm control.
HOSHI: Hull breach on G deck. We're venting atmosphere.
(Then the bombardment stops.)
REED: The Vulcan ships, they're withdrawing.
HOSHI: We're being hailed. It's the High Command.
ARCHER [OC]: Trip, is everything all right?
TUCKER: More or less. What's going on, Captain?
ARCHER [OC]: There've been a few changes here. Get back to Vulcan as
soon as you can.
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Administrator
V'Las has been relieved of his position. His role in the embassy
bombing is being investigated. For the moment, the conflict between
Vulcan and Andoria appears to have been averted.
[T'Pol's quarters]
T'POL: Enter. Captain Archer asked me to express
his gratitude. He wouldn't have succeeded without your transporter
codes.
KOSS: The Captain told me you were in danger. I wouldn't have been a
very good husband if I didn't help.
T'POL: I'm not certain when I'll be able to return. I'm aware that I
promised your family that we would eventually live together.
KOSS: That's not why I've come. I'm releasing you from our marriage. I
know you only bonded with me to help your mother. She's gone now.
There's no reason for us to continue.
T'POL: You don't have to do this.
KOSS: I know. (He turns to leave.)
T'POL: Koss.
KOSS: Goodbye, T'Pol.
[High Command]
PRIEST: The katra is with me now.
SOVAL: How do you feel, Captain?
ARCHER: Like a giant weight's been lifted.
T'PAU: Word has already spread of the discovery. It may take years to
translate all of the writings.
KUVAK: The people of Vulcan are in your debt. Peace, and long life.
(Archer returns the salute.)
T'PAU: You may be witnessing the start of a new era, not only for
Vulcan, but for Earth as well.
SOVAL; The Minister intends to pursue a less aggressive policy toward
your people. The High Command will be dissolved.
T'PAU: You'll no longer have us looking over your shoulder. It's time
for Earth to stand on its own.
ARCHER: We're ready.
[Vulcan]
(Somewhere amongst the ubiquitous rocks, a
clandestine meeting is taking place.)
V'LAS: You've failed. Decades of work have been lost.
ROMULAN: Am I to be blamed for your incompetence?
V'LAS: Archer should've been killed.
ROMULAN: You brought the humans into this. I must leave Vulcan. My
position here has been compromised.
V'LAS: What about me?
ROMULAN: Not now. Your disappearance would cause suspicion. This is
simply a minor delay. The reunification of our people is only a matter
of time.

Daedalus
 Original Airdate: 14 Jan, 2005
  [Corridor]
 TUCKER: I admit it. I've got a few butterflies.
Okay, more than a few.
ARCHER: You haven't stopped talking about this for a week.
TUCKER: Well, it's different for you. You grew up with the man. When I
was seven, my mom bought me a book about him. Emory Erickson, Father of
the Transporter. I made her read it to me every night for a month. That
book is the reason I became an engineer.
ARCHER: Did I ever tell you about meeting Zefram Cochrane?
TUCKER: Yeah, only about fifty times.
ARCHER: Then you know I understand how you feel.
[Transporter alcove]
(Tucker relieves the officer then starts smartening
up his uniform.)
ARCHER: You want a mirror?
TUCKER: You've got a mean streak in you, you know that?
(Archer nods, and Trip beams aboard a tall young woman and a man in a
wheelchair.)
EMORY: Nothing seems to be missing,
ARCHER: Hello, Emory.
EMORY: Jonathan, look at you. I always suspected you'd be famous, just
didn't think that you'd be more famous than me. (They embrace)
DANICA: Jon.
ARCHER: Good to see you. (they kiss and hug)
DANICA: Oh, we have a lot of catching up to do.
EMORY: Do it later. I want a tour of this place.
ARCHER: My Chief Engineer, Commander Charles Tucker.
TUCKER: It's an honour.
EMORY: Guess you and I'll be spending some time together.
TUCKER: I'm looking forward to it.
ARCHER: Danica. Trip.
[Corridor]
(Danica pushes the wheelchair as they head off
along the corridor again.)
EMORY: I hope you don't mind that I'm borrowing your ship, Captain.
ARCHER: As long as you return it in good condition.
EMORY: Don't know if I can promise that. When this test is over,
Enterprise and all of Starfleet could be obsolete.
ARCHER: Sounds like you're trying to put me out of a job.
Captain's Log, supplemental: In preparation for
Doctor Erickson's experiment, we've reduced power on all but essential
areas of the ship.
[Mess hall - reduced lighting]
TUCKER: Feel like some company? We haven't talked
much since Vulcan. How are you holding up?
T'POL: I've been fine.
TUCKER: I've been seeing you by yourself a lot.
T'POL: I'm reading the Kir'Shara.
TUCKER: How is it?
T'POL: Interesting.
TUCKER: Interesting?
T'POL: Extremely.
TUCKER: Look, I know what you're going through. Losing a family member,
it's the toughest thing there is.
T'POL: I see no point in discussing it. It's in the past.
TUCKER: Your mother died a week ago.
T'POL: Talking won't change that.
TUCKER: It may change the way you feel about it.
T'POL: I don't feel anything about it.
TUCKER: You can tell yourself that,
T'POL: It's the truth.
TUCKER: You know, when Lizzie died, there were times I wanted to just
close up, retreat inside myself,
T'POL: Trip, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but it's not
necessary.
TUCKER: You're fine? Well, if you ever do want to talk, let me know.
I'll see you.
[Captain's mess]
(Five people around the table looks somewhat
crowded.)
EMORY: Sub-quantum teleportation. You step on to a transporter on
Earth, a few seconds later, you're on Vulcan.
TUCKER: That's over sixteen light years.
EMORY: That's just for starters. Theoretically, there's no limit to the
distance. One of the things we're here to test. You tell me, with that
kind of technology who'd have any use for a starship?
ARCHER: Maybe you will put me out of a job.
DANICA: Dad,
EMORY: Well, I wouldn't worry too much. It's going to take decades to
work out all the bugs. But when we do, Starfleet's gonna look a hell of
a lot different. That's if it exists at all.
DANICA: You can see he hasn't changed.
ARCHER: I remember you and my father having similar discussions.
EMORY: He believed the future was in the warp drive, I believed in the
transporter pad. I miss those talks. I miss him. To Henry,
(They all raise their wine glasses in silent toast.)
T'POL: The Vulcan Science Academy has been studying sub-quantum
transporting for some time, with little result.
EMORY: I've been trying to get my hands on some of that research for
years. In hindsight, it's probably just as well that I couldn't.
Might've sent me down the wrong path.
TUCKER: It's hard to imagine. Beaming someone that far.
EMORY: All breakthroughs are hard to imagine before they happen. When I
developed the transporter, most people simply couldn't grasp it. Some
still can't.
ARCHER: I have to confess, given a choice, I'd much rather use a good
old-fashioned shuttlepod.
EMORY: I'll never forget the protests when the transporter was first
approved for bio-matter.
DANICA: Oh, God. Here we go.
EMORY: People said it was unsafe, that it caused brain cancer,
psychosis, and even sleep disorders. And then there was all that
metaphysical chatter about whether or not the person who arrived after
the transport was the same person who left, and not some weird copy.
TUCKER: Which would make all of us copies.
EMORY: I had to fight all of that nonsense, and I'm not going to tell
you there weren't costs. I'm living proof of that, but I won. Mankind
is better off. Makes everything I've fought for worthwhile.
TUCKER: Here's to a successful experiment.
(This time, Danica does not raise her glass.)
Captain's Log, supplemental. We're entering an area
known as the Barrens. There's not a star system within a hundred light
years. Perfect conditions for Emory's test.
[Transporter alcove]
(Erickson and Tucker are making modifications to the
equipment.)
EMORY: Those early days were pretty terrifying. I'm lucky to be alive.
TUCKER: Is it true you're the first person to go through?
EMORY: I wasn't about to let anyone else do it.
TUCKER: You must've been scared.
EMORY: Terrified. That original transporter took a full minute and a
half to cycle through. Felt like a year. You could actually feel
yourself being taken apart and put back together. When I materialised,
first thing I did was lose my lunch. Second thing I did was get stone
drunk. Trick I learned from Zefram Cochrane. Now there was a man who
knew the benefits of a little liquid courage. What is it?
TUCKER: Well, you're going to need more juice than I thought.
EMORY: Not more than Enterprise can spare.
TUCKER: Well, we'll have to draw direct from the warp reactor. May even
have to shut down a few systems.
EMORY: You'll be able to leave the lights on.
TUCKER: Yeah. if I could get a look at your power converter, it might
help me out.
EMORY: I'll tell you what. When I'm done with this, I'll install the
converter. See if I can't make life easier on you.
TUCKER: Well, thanks, but when it comes to modifying our systems, I
prefer to do things myself. Can I get a look at it?
EMORY: I said I'd install the converter.
TUCKER: And I said, no, thanks.
EMORY: I wish I had time to debate the finer points of engineering
protocol, but as you can see I'm extremely busy. And I realise this is
your ship and I'm only a guest, but let me remind you that Starfleet
has granted me complete access to your systems. If you hadn't noticed,
I'm more than capable of handling a little power upgrade. Hand me that,
will you?
[Engineering]
DANICA: That's the main reactor and those are the
plasma feeds, right?
ARCHER: You know the ship like a member of the crew.
DANICA: I've read just about everything I could find on her. I probably
could describe every one of your missions.
ARCHER: Still wonder why you haven't signed on.
DANICA: I think you know the answer.
ARCHER: Your father seems like he can take care of himself. He sure
hasn't lost any of his edge.
DANICA: Can't argue with that.
ARCHER: So, why are you still on Earth?
DANICA: He needs me. He still hasn't gotten over Quinn.
ARCHER: It's been fourteen years.
DANICA: Fifteen.
ARCHER: He lost a son. If you leave, he'll lose a daughter.
DANICA: If this test goes well, it'll be a new start for him. Give him
something to look forward to. He won't spend all of his time thinking
about the past.
ARCHER: And if the test doesn't go well?
DANICA: I don't know.
ARCHER: We both grew up with fathers who could be pretty demanding.
DANICA: That's an understatement.
(they head out into)
[Corridor]
ARCHER: Maybe you should start thinking more about
yourself. I know. It's hard taking advice from someone who used to
chase you around the backyard with a plastic laser pistol.
DANICA: Yeah, but it's good advice, Jonathan. I just wish I could
follow it.
[Erickson's quarters]
EMORY: How was your tour?
DANICA: I enjoyed it.
(She prepares a hypospray and raises his shirt to reveal a very
deformed spine.)
EMORY: I can always tell when you're upset. You do this like you're in
a hurry.
DANICA: Don't you think there's something to be upset about?
EMORY: We're here. That's reason enough to be optimistic.
DANICA: We're lying to them.
EMORY: We have no choice.
DANICA: We could talk to Jon. He might be able to help us.
EMORY: No. He wouldn't understand. We can't say anything to him. We
can't trust anyone.
DANICA: It's Jon.
EMORY: He's a Starfleet captain. His first duty is to his ship.
DANICA: You talk about him like he's an enemy.
EMORY: He's not an enemy. But he's not on our side, either. Believe me.
[Armoury]
(The lights suddenly flicker and go out.)
BURROWS: It's from over there.
REED: No. (He points somewhere else then hands over a weapon.) REED: I'll
take up. You take down.
[Bridge]
T'POL: It could be a form of spatial distortion.
ARCHER: Can you pinpoint it?
T'POL: F Deck. Near the Armoury.
[Armoury]
(An electric arcing effect is going on as the two
men search for the cause. A distorted something hits Burrows, and he
screams.)
REED: Sickbay! Crewman down in the Armoury!
(He rushes to Burrows, turns him over and sees that half his face is
now a squidgy mess.)
[Transporter alcove]
T'POL: He suffered massive cellular disruption, as
if he'd been subjected to intense delta radiation.
DANICA: Did other crewmen see anything?
ARCHER: The lights were malfunctioning.
EMORY: This anomaly you detected, you think it was somehow responsible?
ARCHER: It showed up at the same time, in the same location. Can't have
been a coincidence.
EMORY: I sympathise, believe me. During the initial tests for the
transporter, some brave men and women were lost. Not a day goes by that
I don't think about them. How can I help?
T'POL: You've spent a great deal of time in this region of space.
EMORY: I never encountered anything like this.
T'POL: Are you sure?
EMORY: There's a reason this is called the Barrens, Captain. There's
nothing out here.
ARCHER: Something out here killed one of my crewmen.
EMORY: I wish I had an explanation for you. (shifts in discomfort)
ARCHER: What is it?
EMORY: Time for my treatment. Dani? Sorry. (as she wheels him away) Can
we continue this later?
ARCHER: Of course.
[Erickson's quarters]
EMORY: Calm down.
DANICA: You never said that anything like this would happen.
EMORY: I didn't know this would happen.
DANICA: Dad, a man is dead, and we're responsible. I'm not going to go
along with this anymore.
EMORY: Listen to me,
DANICA: No, no. We've got to tell them the truth!
EMORY: Dani, you're condemning him to death.
DANICA: I'm condemning him? How do you know he isn't already dead?
EMORY: He's alive.
DANICA: Dad, Jonathan's practically family. He and Quinn were best
friends.
EMORY: I know. I know that.
DANICA: We can't do this to him, to his crew.
EMORY: We're almost ready for our first test.
DANICA: Someone else could die before then.
EMORY: The odds of that happening again are extremely small. No one's
going to die. I just need a couple of days. We owe him that much, Dani.
DANICA: I wonder what he would have to say about all this. About what
we're doing.
EMORY: When we're done, you can ask him.
[Transporter alcove]
TUCKER: Routing power. (the lights dim and go up
again on the Bridge) Ready.
EMORY: Help me up.
TUCKER: Sir?
EMORY: Give me a hand, please. (Tucker helps him stand at the control
console.)EMORY:  This part I like doing myself. Energising.
(A contraption is beamed away.)
[Bridge]
T'POL: The probe materialised at the target
coordinates.
ARCHER: (into comm.) Looks like it arrived in good condition.
T'POL: Captain, we're receiving telemetry.
[Transporter alcove]
ARCHER [OC]: We're already getting back data.
Congratulations, Emory.
TUCKER: Forty thousand kilometres. Nothings ever gone that far.
EMORY: It's a start.
TUCKER: It's going to take a few hours to gather all the telemetry.
Let's celebrate in Mess Hall. My treat.
EMORY: I like to monitor the data as it comes in. I'm sort of obsessive
that way.
TUCKER: Well, then let me bring something back for you. Help pass the
time between data streams.
EMORY: No, thanks.
TUCKER: It's been a long day. You must be starving.
EMORY: You go ahead. I'll join you later.
TUCKER: You sure you don't want a second pair of eyes?
EMORY: One pair will do. And no offence, Commander, but I work much
better when I'm not being distracted.
TUCKER: You know where to find me.
[Archer's quarters]
ARCHER: Come in.
TUCKER: Something's wrong. Most of the work Emory had me do, tapping
into the warp reactor for extra power, re-routing the plasma flow. It
wasn't necessary for the test.
ARCHER: What are you saying?
TUCKER: Remember when the lights dimmed?
ARCHER: Yeah.
TUCKER: Well, he channeled that energy into a feedback loop. It wasn't
going into the beam.
ARCHER: Maybe he needs the power for another phase of the experiment.
TUCKER: Well, from what I can tell, his sub-quantum version should use
less energy than a regular transporter. That's one of the reasons it's
so brilliant. Either he was keeping me busy, making sure I was looking
the other way, or this sub-quantum thing is a smoke screen for
something else. Something he hasn't told us about. I wouldn't have
picked up on any of it if you hadn't asked me to take a closer look.
ARCHER: When I asked Emory about the anomaly that killed Burrows, he
claimed he'd never heard of anything like it.
TUCKER: Not true?
ARCHER: Something very similar appeared on Emory's research ship five
years ago. T'Pol dug up the report from Starfleet's data banks. A crew
member saw it. Said it seemed to be alive.
T'POL [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: We're picking up another one.
[Bridge]
T'POL: It's on C deck, section five.
ARCHER [OC]: On my way.
[C deck, section 5]
(With weapons at the ready, the Captain and a pair
of MACOs join T'Pol where the lights are flickering.)
T'POL: It's fluctuating.
ARCHER: What's your best guess?
T'POL: I've lost it.
ARCHER: (to the MACOs) Take section three. Take section four. Don't let
it touch you.
T'POL: This way. It should be here.
(The weird phenomenon appears behind them.)
T'POL: It's highly unstable, surrounded by a subspace field.
(It passes between them, just touching T'Pol, who collapses in agony.)
[Sickbay]
(Phlox treats the back of T'Pol's hand.) PHLOX: You're
fortunate you didn't have more prolonged contact. (He refers to her
scanner.) PHLOX: Can you put that down for thirty seconds?
T'POL: I took visual readings.
(Tucker transfers the data to the main Sickbay monitor.)
ARCHER: Can you slow it down? (The image starts to look humanoid.) ARCHER: Hold
it. Enhance. A little more.
(A recognisably human face appears and Archer goes pensive.)
TUCKER: Who is it?
ARCHER: It's Quinn. Emory's son.
[Erickson's quarters]
(Looking at the image on the desk monitor.)
EMORY: That's incredible. He hasn't aged a day.
ARCHER: Emory?
EMORY: I'm not here to test a new transporter. I'm here to bring back
my son.
ARCHER: What are you talking about?
EMORY: We were conducting first trials. My greatest achievement. Quinn
wanted to be the first to go through. He was a lot like his old man. A
lot like you. I lost his signal and couldn't get it back. Truth is, the
sub-quantum transporter is a fundamentally flawed concept. It'll never
work. Not now, not a thousand years from now. I suppose I knew that at
the time.
ARCHER: You let him go through with the test?
EMORY: I was a relatively young man who had created something that
changed Starfleet. After an achievement of that magnitude, there was
nowhere to go but down. My life became just one long struggle to
recapture past glory.
ARCHER: I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about Quinn.
EMORY: I wasn't thinking of the consequences.
ARCHER: You said you came here to get him back?
EMORY: This region, the Barrens, is actually a subspace node, a bubble
of curved space-time. It's why there are no stars. Quinn's transporter
signal is trapped here. At certain intervals, there are fluctuations in
the node that cause the signal to reappear. If we can lock onto it at
one of those intervals we can save him.
ARCHER: You could've told me all of this before.
EMORY: Starfleet would never have authorised the mission. I had to
create an excuse.
ARCHER: A member of my crew is dead.
EMORY: I didn't know that the manifestations would be dangerous,
believe me.
ARCHER: You want me to believe you?
EMORY: I want you to help me. Quinn was like a brother to you.
ARCHER: You were like my second father. You should've trusted me.
EMORY: All I need is one more scan. I can bring him back.
ARCHER: Is that the truth?
EMORY: I'm not lying.
ARCHER: You've been lying to me since you came aboard.
EMORY: I had no choice! I'm sorry. Please help me, Jonathan. Help me
save my son. Please.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: I want you both to work with Emory, give
him whatever help he needs. What is it, Trip?
TUCKER: I can't believe I'm hearing this. We've already lost one man.
ARCHER: It won't happen again. We'll alert the crew to the danger.
TUCKER: If they'd been alerted twenty four hours ago, Burrows might be
alive.
T'POL: We don't fully understand the nature of these manifestations.
They could pose other dangers.
ARCHER: I know there's a risk. We're talking one more day. That's all
Emory needs.
T'POL: What he claims he needs.
ARCHER: I believe him.
T'POL: Because he's a friend of the family?
ARCHER: That's not why I'm doing this.
TUCKER: Why are you doing this?
ARCHER: Quinn's signal is getting weaker, Trip. It's been decaying for
the past fifteen years. Emory says if we don't do something now, we'll
never get him back in one piece. We have a responsibility to help.
TUCKER: What about Emory's responsibility? He lied to get us out here.
ARCHER: I'm aware of that. But we're here. We can't just turn the ship
around and leave a man to die. You have your orders. I suggest you get
started.
[Transporter alcove]
TUCKER: We're still getting a spike in the array. I
could swap out the emitter coils with something from Engineering. Might
even out a bit.
EMORY: Sounds good.
TUCKER: I'll get on it.
EMORY: I know you don't approve of what I've done.
TUCKER: You need my approval?
EMORY: I'm disappointed that you think less of me.
TUCKER: You liked me better when I worshipped your shadow?
EMORY: Yes. It's an honest answer.
TUCKER: I'd think you'd be out of practice.
EMORY: You may want to reserve judgment on my actions until you've lost
a son.
TUCKER: I have lost someone close, and I'd do almost anything to get
her back. Except put other people in danger.
EMORY: Quinn and I used to argue all the time. Wasn't until I lost him
that I realised that those arguments were some of the happiest moments
of my life.
TUCKER: I'll be in Engineering.
[Archer's quarters]
DANICA: Can I come in? Hey there. You must be
Porthos. I've heard a lot about you. (moves to stroke him and the
little dog immediately presents his tummy for scratching) He's got a
lot of personality.
ARCHER: And an appetite to match.
DANICA: I wanted to say that I'm sorry. I should've come to you
earlier. I feel responsible. You lost a crewman.
ARCHER: We can't change what's happened. Maybe some good can come out
of it.
DANICA: You think we can get him back?
EMORY: I think that it's possible. That's enough reason for me to try.
DANICA: I wonder what it must be like for him, you know? Is he in pain?
Is he conscious? If he is, does he think that we've forgotten about
him? Quinn was everything to my father. To both of us. Getting him back
is all that we've thought about for the past fifteen years.
ARCHER: Let's hope when this is over, you'll have something else to
think about.
[Engineering]
T'POL: The power conversion tables. Some of these
modifications should help.
TUCKER: Thanks.
T'POL: Is there anything else?
TUCKER: No, I think we're pretty much there. (she turns to go) I'm
trying to decide what to show for movie night.
T'POL: Movie night?
TUCKER: Yeah, I thought I'd fire up the old tradition. You in the mood
for a horror film or a musical?
T'POL: I don't think I'll have the time for either.
TUCKER: You can't spend every second of your life studying that,
whatever it's called.
T'POL: Kir'Shara.
TUCKER: You got to take a break eventually.
T'POL: Eventually.
TUCKER: I don't get you, T'Pol. I thought you joined Starfleet so you
could interact a little more with humans. But it seems to me that ever
since we left spacedock, you spend all your free time cooped up in your
room reading that bible of yours.
T'POL: I may have found new priorities.
TUCKER: What's that supposed to mean?
T'POL: I'm needed on the Bridge.
[Launch bay]
(Archer has wheeled Emory down to see the
shuttlepods.)
T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Archer.
[Bridge]
T'POL: I picked up something that was in your area,
but I've lost it.
[Launch bay]
ARCHER: Keep monitoring.
EMORY: (with a scanner) He's here.
(The lights flicker and the electric crackling starts.)
EMORY: Jonathan. There.
(The 'figure' walks out of the shuttlepod nose.)
EMORY: Quinn? Quinn?
(It walks through a wall panel, setting off an explosion. Archer gets
to Emory just in time to protect him.)
[Corridor]
TUCKER: It knocked out an EPS junction. Repair's
going to take a couple of hours.
ARCHER: Will it affect the transporter?
TUCKER: No. I can't believe you're still going through with this.
ARCHER: We're not going to have this argument again.
TUCKER: That thing barely missed a stack of torpedoes. If it had jumped
two feet to the left we wouldn't be here to talk about it. We should
concentrate on repairing the ship so we can get out of here.
ARCHER: If we beam Quinn aboard there won't be any more of these
manifestations.
TUCKER: How the hell do you know?
ARCHER: Trip.
TUCKER: You're putting your personal feelings before the safety of this
ship.
ARCHER: And you are this close to insubordination.
TUCKER: Insubordination?
ARCHER: I've made a decision. It's the right decision, and the
discussion is over. Can you accept that? Now go do your job.
TUCKER: Yes, sir.
[Erickson's quarters]
EMORY: I got what I needed. You should be able to
get a good lock when he reappears.
ARCHER: When will that be?
EMORY: Just over three hours. How's your ship?
ARCHER: We're ready.
EMORY: You saved my life
ARCHER: Forget it.
EMORY: You didn't deserve any of this, Jonathan. I'm sorry this became
your problem.
ARCHER: Let's make it worthwhile. Let's get Quinn back.
EMORY: I'm scared.
ARCHER: I don't blame you.
EMORY: I've waited so long for this moment. Planned for it. What if
something goes wrong? What if I fail?
ARCHER: On the day before I entered flight training, I asked my father
pretty much the same thing.
EMORY: What did he say?
ARCHER: Don't fail.
EMORY: Henry never was a poet.
ARCHER: He didn't need to be.
[Transporter alcove]
EMORY: Any moment now.
ARCHER: T'Pol.
[Bridge]
T'POL: Nothing.
[Transporter alcove]
T'POL [OC]: Captain.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
[Bridge]
T'POL: B deck, section eight.
[Transporter alcove]
EMORY: Confinement beam. Widest possible spread.
TUCKER: Way ahead of you. Got a lock on something. Pattern's good
EMORY: Let me. (He heaves himself out of his wheelchair.) EMORY: Energising.
(The energy figure starts to appear.)
EMORY: We need more power.
TUCKER: That's all we got.
EMORY: It's working.
(The figure moves, arms reach out, and the face is briefly
recognisable.)
DANICA: Quinn.
EMORY: (losing him) No. No. (Phlox scans the figure.) EMORY: Complete the
transport sequence.
TUCKER: I don't have a strong enough signal.
EMORY: Recalibrate the confinement beam.
TUCKER: That won't help get us a lock.
EMORY: Just do it.
PHLOX: I'm reading massive cellular deterioration.
EMORY: That's not possible.
PHLOX: He's losing cohesion. If he materialises, he'll die in seconds.
EMORY: I can reverse the damage by cross-phasing the stream.
TUCKER: The transporter can't do that.
EMORY: I built the damn thing!
PHLOX: I'm losing his vital signs.
ARCHER: Emory,
EMORY: Get away from me. Tie in the secondary buffers.
TUCKER: There's not enough time.
DANICA: Dad.
EMORY: I can hold the pattern. Just do it!
DANICA: Dad, let him go.
EMORY: No!
PHLOX: There's nothing you can do for him.
EMORY: I can't let him go. I can't!
ARCHER: Emory, you can't save him.
EMORY: I'm sorry, Quinn.
(He materialises a young man in a brown boiler suit, who collapses to
the floor. Emory manages to go over and sit beside him, cradling his
head.)
EMORY: Oh, Quinn.
QUINN: Dad? What's wrong?
EMORY: Quinn, please forgive me, please.
QUINN: What is it? What?
(Emory closes his dead son's eyes, and cries.)
[Erickson's quarters]
EMORY: Come in. (Archer enters.) EMORY: I couldn't leave
him like that. It's better to be alive or dead, not somewhere in
between.
ARCHER: If it means anything, my guess is Quinn would feel the same
way.
EMORY: I came here to bring my son home. I suppose I accomplished my
goal.
ARCHER: I've been in contact with Starfleet.
EMORY: I imagine they're not too happy with all of this.
ARCHER: I'm sure they'll take your achievements into consideration.
EMORY: I perpetrated a fraud to obtain the use of your ship. A member
of your crew is dead. There's no way I'm going to avoid the
consequences. There's one good thing to come out of this. Dani won't
have to worry about taking care of me anymore. I managed to let go of
one of my children. Now I guess it's time for me to let go of the other
one.
ARCHER: I always thought she should be out here.
EMORY: Maybe they'll put me somewhere where I'll be useful. Get a
chance to teach.
ARCHER: You'd probably be good at it.
EMORY: I wouldn't be boring. Why settle for making myself miserable
when I can spread the misery around to an entire class of students?
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: Your neurolytic enzymes are at the same
level they were a week ago. No sign of Pa'Nar Syndrome.
T'POL: It's still difficult for me to accept.
PHLOX: You were diagnosed with an incurable disease. Now it's gone.
It's a big adjustment. From what I've been reading, similar diagnoses
are taking place all over Vulcan. People with Pa'Nar are coming
forward. It's no longer a stigma.
T'POL: The Kir'Shara is having an enormous impact.
PHLOX: It's clearly had an impact on you. You seem more certain of
yourself.
T'POL: I've never felt less certain.
PHLOX: You're re-examining your core beliefs. Something most people
never do.
[Engineering]
T'POL: Do you have a moment?
TUCKER: Sure. Something tells me you're not here to talk about movie
night.
T'POL: I'm going through something that's very complicated.
TUCKER: I know.
T'POL: I'm learning, it seems for the first time what it truly means to
be Vulcan.
TUCKER: Well, maybe you can fill me in.
T'POL: Not until I understand it myself. I don't think there'll be time
for (pauses)
TUCKER: What do you want me to say?
T'POL: That you understand.
TUCKER: I do. It's not like I didn't know this was coming. (as she
turns away) At least my warp engines still need me.
Captain's log, supplemental. We've rendezvoused
with the Sarajevo, which will be returning Emory and Danica to Earth.
[Transporter alcove]
(T'Pol and Phlox are also present.)
ARCHER: Safe journey.
EMORY: And you, Jonathan. Commander. (They shake hands.) EMORY: An honour working with
you. Some suggestions. This might boost your transporter range a few
hundred kilometres. (He hands over a PADD.) EMORY: Couldn't resist.
TUCKER: I'll check it out.
DANICA: Say good-bye to Porthos.
ARCHER: Good luck.
DANICA: Maybe I'll see you around.
(Tucker beams the Father of the Transporter, and his daughter, away, then
the group go back to their normal duties.)

Observer
Effect
 Original Airdate: 21 Jan, 2005
  [Mess
hall]
 (Enterprise is in orbit of a grey planet, and Reed
and Travis are playing chess.)
TRAVIS: You'll win in eight moves.
(Reed turns the board around so they can set up a fresh game.)
REED:
You're really starting to get a feel for the game.
TRAVIS: Thirty two pieces, sixty four squares. It's not as if it's
difficult. The total number of possible outcomes is limited.
REED: Ten to the one hundred twenty third power.
TRAVIS: That's what I mean. Chess is so predictable, I'm surprised
anyone bothers to play it.
(The new game starts quickly, with Travis playing white.)
REED:
Their average life span's only about a hundred years. With no time to
play all the possible games.
TRAVIS: What a waste.
REED: Careful. No emotional involvement.
TRAVIS: I know the rules. Observation without interference.
(Another speed-chess game finishes already.)
TRAVIS: You'll win in five moves.
REED: I'm the ship's champion. I win all the tournaments.
TRAVIS: How do you think they'll react to what's on this planet?
REED: Well, that's what we're here to find out, but in my experience,
all physical species are alike. I don't expect humans will be any
different.
TRAVIS: Do you think our hosts will die tonight?
REED: It's possible. For some of the species that have come here, I've
seen the whole crew die. For others, only a few.
TRAVIS: But somebody always dies.
REED: Always.
(A new game is set up.)
REED: Your move.
[Shuttlepod]
(An away team is returning from the planet.
Hoshi pulls something from her hair.
HOSHI: I can't wait to get back.
TUCKER: Two days ago, you couldn't wait to get off the ship.
HOSHI: Sifting through a Klingon garbage dump. Not my idea of exploring
strange new worlds.
TUCKER: Getting tired of exploration, Ensign? All the planets starting
to look alike?
HOSHI: Not a chance, sir.
TUCKER: I didn't think so. (coughs) I feel like I'm still breathing
dirt. Shuttlepod One to Enterprise.
ARCHER [OC]: Welcome back. How did your treasure hunt turn out?
TUCKER: Well, nothing worth bringing home. The Klingons must've been
here years ago. All they left was an old power cell and a bunch of
empty ration packs.
HOSHI: And a latrine.
TUCKER: Yeah. A long hot shower's looking pretty good. Shuttlepod One
out.
(Trip has a coughing fit.)
HOSHI: Commander? What's wrong?!
TUCKER: Take over.
(He gets out of the pilot's seat.)
TUCKER: Got to dock.
(He collapses on the floor.)
HOSHI: Shuttlepod One to Enterprise.
[Bridge]
HOSHI [OC]: I have a medical emergency. Commander
Tucker's collapsed.
ARCHER: Can you bring the shuttlepod in?
[Shuttlepod]
HOSHI: Yes, sir. At least in simulations.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Slow and steady, Ensign. I'll see you in
Decon.
[Shuttlepod]
HOSHI: Understood.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: (to T'Pol) Call Phlox.
(Travis and Reed exchange a knowing look.)
[Decon]
(Archer and Phlox are outside the chamber, Hoshi
and Tucker are inside.)
ARCHER: Trip, how you feeling?
TUCKER: Like I've been gut-punched by a Tellarite.
HOSHI: Doctor, should we start with the bio-gel?
PHLOX: Not until we know what we're dealing with. Three other landing
parties returned from the surface with no ill effects.
ARCHER: We need to check out the shuttlepod, too. See if any of its
environmental systems were at fault.
TUCKER: I can do that, Captain. I should've thought of that myself.
ARCHER: Stay where you are, Trip. Phlox needs blood samples.
PHLOX: Here's the medkits.
(He puts them through the decon chamber wall but as Hoshi comes to get
them, she starts coughing.)
ARCHER: Hoshi, what is it?
HOSHI: Before Commander Tucker passed out, he started coughing.
PHLOX: Are you feeling any other symptoms?
(She dashes into the bathroom and throws up.)
TUCKER: I'm going to guess that's a yes.
PHLOX: I'll prepare anti-nausea medication. You get me those blood
samples as soon as you can.
(Phlox and Archer head off down the corridor.)
ARCHER: Anything?
PHLOX: Whatever's afflicting them, it's not showing up on the standard
scans.
ARCHER: Doesn't sound good.
PHLOX: It's not.
[Corridor]
TRAVIS: I studied your report on how the Klingons
reacted to the infection.
REED: Their response was typical for a species at their level of
development.
TRAVIS: The Klingon commander didn't let his landing party back on his
ship.
REED: Your point?
TRAVIS: Captain Archer did.
REED: Captain Archer's done nothing different from the Klingons. The
launch bay and Decon Chamber are completely isolated from the rest of
the ship.
TRAVIS: So it doesn't matter if an infected landing party comes aboard.
REED: Precisely. Humans don't want to interact with dying crew mates
any more than Klingons did. If it was left to me, I'd stop our
observations immediately. We have nothing more to learn from humans.
[Turbolift]
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't know. They're showing concern
for each other. The Cardassians did that when they were here, didn't
they?
REED: Ah, but in the end they killed their infected crew, just as the
Klingons did. The only difference is the time it took to reach that
decision.
TRAVIS: Maybe the humans will surprise us.
REED: I've been observing aliens for eight hundred years. I've yet to
be surprised. Still, we should follow protocol. Start questioning the
infected crew. I'll check in with the Doctor.
[Decon Chamber]
(Hoshi is cleaned up and in a fresh uniform.)
TUCKER: Okay, this is for nausea, muscle pain, and a cough suppressant.
HOSHI: I'm not coughing anymore. Neither are you. Maybe we're getting
better.
TUCKER: Well, Doctor's orders
(Travis arrives at the window, and knocks to get their attention.)
TRAVIS: Commander, Hoshi. Just wanted to say hi.
TUCKER: We're a little busy right now, Travis.
TRAVIS: Can you tell me what's in the hypospray?
HOSHI: Something for our symptoms.
TUCKER: Yeah. Phlox doesn't know what's wrong with us yet.
TRAVIS: Have either of you faced serious illness before?
TUCKER: Aren't you supposed to be on duty?
TRAVIS: I was curious to know how you'd compare this experience with
other illnesses you might've contracted.
TUCKER: Travis, we really need to get some sleep.
TRAVIS: I only have a few more questions.
TUCKER: Thanks for stopping by.
(He slides a privacy cover across the window.)
TRAVIS: But
[Sickbay]
(Phlox is putting a culture slide under a
microscope.)
PHLOX: Lieutenant Reed. Something I can do for you?
REED: Headache.
PHLOX: Of course. Just a moment.
(Reed looking at the monitor displays.)
REED:
Are these are the blood tests for Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato?
PHLOX: That's correct.
(Phlox scans Reed.)
PHLOX: I'm not detecting any vascular involvement.
(Reed looks quizzical.)
PHLOX: Your headache. Not a bad one, I take it?
REED: No, not yet. Although it feels like it could get worse.
Preventive measure. A lot to do today.
PHLOX: Mild analgesic it is.
(Phlox gives him the shot.)
REED: Doctor, I'm curious to know how you think these tests will help
you develop an effective treatment.
PHLOX: So am I.
REED: I mean, are you approaching this strictly on a symptomatic level,
or do you believe there's any similarity to other conditions you've
seen in the past?
PHLOX: Lieutenant, I believe I can put your mind at ease. If your
colleagues have returned with a contagious illness, there is no way it
can spread to the rest of the ship. We are all quite safe.
(Phlox opens the Sickbay doors and gestures for him to leave.)
REED: I'm not worried about that, no. I'm interested in the methodology
PHLOX: Out, out, out! I have a lot to do as well.
[Decon chamber]
(Hoshi has wrapped a blanket around herself.)
TUCKER: You ever see The Andromeda Strain?
HOSHI: Strain of what?
TUCKER: No, it's a movie. Mid-twentieth century.
HOSHI: Let me guess. Doctor Andromeda builds a monster, and it kills
him in the end.
TUCKER: It's about an extraterrestrial disease.
HOSHI: All your movies are the same. I can't keep the stories straight.
TUCKER: This reminds me of my dorm room at Starfleet Training. Got into
a lot of trouble at old STC.
HOSHI: I got kicked out.
TUCKER: Well, you can't stop there.
HOSHI: In my second month, I had a difference of opinion with the
Company Commander. I broke his arm.
TUCKER: Can I ask why?
HOSHI: Poker.
TUCKER: You broke his arm playing cards?
HOSHI: He tried to shut down a game I was running for some of the
recruits, and a couple of the training staff.
TUCKER: Hold on. You ran a floating poker game at STC?
HOSHI: The way the regulations are worded, gambling was an honour
violation only if it took place during duty hours. So I ran the game on
weekends. One night my C.C. showed up, tried to sweep all the chips off
the table, and I. Well, I have a black belt in aikido. I think he was
just upset that I hadn't invited him to play.
TUCKER: What happened?
HOSHI: I got a bad conduct discharge.
TUCKER: How the hell did you end up on Enterprise?
HOSHI: Starfleet needed language specialists more than they needed to
make an example out of me. They let me back in on probation, and here I
am.
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: The closest classification it matches is a
virus. Highly contagious. Silicon-based.
ARCHER: This is an M class planet. All life forms down there should be
carbon-based.
PHLOX: I can only surmise the virus was brought here. Perhaps by a
meteorite, which could explain why only one of our landing parties
encountered it.
ARCHER: Is there a treatment?
PHLOX: There's no record of anything like it in the Denobulan database.
ARCHER: Then it's up to you.
PHLOX: I'll do all I can, Captain, but at the rate the pathogen is
reproducing, Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato have less than five hours
to live.
[Mess hall]
TRAVIS: The Doctor identified the pathogen.
REED: That happens thirty seven percent of the time.
TRAVIS: But no one's made the decision to abandon the infected crew
members.
REED: Then this'll likely be one of the times when everyone dies.
[Decon]
(The window is still covered over when Archer
'rings the doorbell'.)
TUCKER [OC]: Travis, if that's you again.
ARCHER: It's me.
(The cover slides back to reveal a pasty-faced, sweaty Tucker.)
TUCKER: Next time I ask to go on a landing party, talk me out of it,
okay?
ARCHER: You're usually too stubborn to be talked out of anything. But
I'll do my best. How's Hoshi?
TUCKER: Sleeping. Whatever Phlox gave us, at least it's helping with
the pain.
ARCHER: Phlox identified what's causing all the trouble. A
silicon-based virus.
TUCKER: I don't suppose he's on his way over here with the cure.
ARCHER: He's working on it. So is T'Pol.
TUCKER: So, there is no cure.
ARCHER: Not yet.
TUCKER: I'm getting the idea you're up against a deadline.
ARCHER: If you mean how much time do you have, it's too early for that
kind of talk. Your own immune system could knock this thing out.
TUCKER: I remember Exobiology 101, Captain. Humans are carbon-based.
Our immune system can't fight silicon.
ARCHER: Don't you give up on me.
TUCKER: There are still a bunch of planets out there we haven't seen.
ARCHER: Get some rest.
[Corridor]
TRAVIS: We're looking for signs of elevated
intelligence in the species we observe.
REED: Rational intelligence, yes. Which Archer has not demonstrated.
The longer the infected crew remain on board, the greater the risk that
quarantine will fail.
TRAVIS: I'm sure Captain Archer knows exactly what the risk is. Maybe
it's not as important to him as standing by his crew.
REED: It's just as probable that he hasn't realised how hopeless the
situation is.
TRAVIS: There's a way to be sure.
REED: We chose the Helmsman and the Armory Officer for good reason.
They're both stationed on the Bridge, yet neither plays a critical role
in a medical emergency.
TRAVIS: Which is why we should inhabit the Doctor and the Science
Officer. Archer relies on their findings to make his decisions. We
could witness that as it happens.
REED: The more people we inhabit, the greater the chance that we will
inadvertently interfere.
TRAVIS: The more people we inhabit, the more we'll be able to observe.
[Decon chamber]
TUCKER: How many languages can you speak?
HOSHI: That's not how it works. There are a lot of common patterns. I'm
just good at hearing them, that's all.
TUCKER: Good? You're a genius. The way you can pick up an alien
language you've never heard before and start spouting it back to them?
I got to tell you, I've always been jealous you can do that.
HOSHI: I wish I could fix warp engines with duct tape and a pocket
knife.
TUCKER: It's a bit more complicated than that. Sometimes.
HOSHI: Seriously. Engineering, building things. have you always been
good at that?
TUCKER: When I was a kid, not so good at building. But I was a terror
when it came to taking things apart. My folks used to put all our
kitchen appliances on the highest shelves. One Thanksgiving, I
have no idea what I was thinking, but I removed every screw from this
big dining room table we had. It was so old, the wood sort of stuck
together, so it stayed standing until my dad put the turkey down. I
spent the next month in my room.
HOSHI: How old were you?
TUCKER: Oh, twenty four, twenty five.
(Hoshi notices T'Pol and Phlox watching through the window.)
TUCKER: How long have they been there?
HOSHI: We didn't see you there.
PHLOX: We didn't want to interrupt you.
TUCKER: How's the research coming?
T'POL: We're waiting on new test results.
PHLOX: We thought we'd see how you two were progressing.
TUCKER: You're the ones with the medical scanners.
PHLOX: We were more interested in discussing your state of mind.
TUCKER: Look, if you really want to know how we feel, we'd be a lot
better knowing you two were back in Sickbay working on the cure for
this.
T'POL: Of course. We're going there now.
PHLOX: Commander. Ensign.
(The pair walk off.)
HOSHI: They both came to see us. Maybe that means they're almost
finished.
TUCKER: Yeah, unless there's nothing more they can do.
[Corridor]
PHLOX: They're very brave, the way they're facing
death.
T'POL: Their courage isn't at question. Their intelligence is.
PHLOX: You want the humans to fail.
T'POL: This isn't a competition. Either a species' intelligence is
developed enough for First Contact, or it isn't.
PHLOX: Perhaps we should consider other qualities in making our
decision.
T'POL: This is the measure we have used for ten thousand years. It's
not our responsibility to change it.
PHLOX: Then whose responsibility is it?
[Situation room]
ARCHER: There. If Phlox is right about the virus
coming here on a meteorite, that crater might be the source of it.
Which means the Klingons at this campsite must have been infected, too.
Set up a priority channel to Starfleet Command. We need to find out
which Klingon ship explored this world, and whether or not they
developed a cure.
REED: Right away, sir.
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: Those are the new test results my host is
waiting for.
T'POL: We should leave these creatures to their work undisturbed.
PHLOX: The Helmsman and the Armoury Officer are back on the Bridge.
(We see Reed and Travis sit up slightly and exchange knowing looks on
the Bridge.)
PHLOX: The altered immune receptors weren't effective.
T'POL: This could indicate the virus is sensitive to ionizing
radiation.
PHLOX: At levels that would be fatal to humans, but it's a start.
T'POL: I'll prepare new samples for testing.
[Decon chamber]
(Hoshi is shouting in her sleep.)
TUCKER: Hoshi. Hoshi, wake up.
HOSHI: I was back in Brazil. The shuttle was coming to take me to
Enterprise.
TUCKER: That's where we are.
HOSHI: Captain Archer needed me early. I didn't get the chance to say
goodbye to my students.
TUCKER: You'll see them again.
[Situation room]
Archer is pacing when Travis and Reed join him.)
ARCHER: I've heard from Starfleet. They're working through diplomatic
channels to contact the Klingons, but it might not be necessary. This
spectrograph identifies a Klingon alloy.
REED: That's the signature of standard hull plating.
ARCHER: I found it here.
TRAVIS: You've detected a debris cloud in orbit.
ARCHER: It's what's left of a Klingon shuttlecraft. Their response to
an infected landing party. The Commander killed his own shuttle crew.
REED: They didn't even plead for mercy. I mean, they wouldn't, would
they? Being Klingon.
TRAVIS: Captain, does knowing what the Klingons did help us at all?
ARCHER: At least we know we don't have to bother asking them if they
have a cure.
TRAVIS: But if they had developed one, you'd ask them for it, right?
ARCHER: On bended knee.
[Decon chamber]
HOSHI: Yo se que estoy atrasada. Enterprise no se
va hasta manana. Solo necesito cinco minutos.
TUCKER: Hoshi, we're in quarantine for a reason.
HOSHI: (in Klingon)
TUCKER: I have no idea what you're saying, but you can't break the
lockout code.
HOSHI: Math is just another language.
(The red light goes green, the door opens and alarms go off in the
corridor.)
[Bridge]
REED: Quarantine breach on D deck. The Decon
Chamber has been unsealed.
(Hoshi makes her way along corridors as Tucker doesn't have the energy
to go after her.)
REED: Someone's overriding the safety interlocks.
ARCHER: Shut down all power to D deck. I want those doors sealed.
[Corridor]
(The lights have gone out, there's just red
emergency lighting, and finally Tucker has stirred himself.)
TUCKER: Hoshi, you have to stop. That's an airlock. You open those
doors, we die.
HOSHI: Haye nuzhno skazat dosvidaniya.
TUCKER: Hoshi, come on.
(He takes hold of her, and they struggle until she collapses in tears
in his arms.)
HOSHI: I need to tell them while there's still time.
TUCKER: The Captain won't let us down.
[Decon chamber]
TUCKER: Trip to whoever's out there. We're back.
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: Commander, I want you to set your hypospray
for three units of sonambutril.
TUCKER [on monitor]: That could drop a horse.
ARCHER: We can't risk Hoshi wandering off again. Especially since it
seems she can override every security safeguard on Enterprise.
[Decon chamber]
TUCKER: Yeah, she's full of surprises today.
(He injects her and she just slumps on the bed. He covers her with a
blanket.)
TUCKER: Sweet dreams, Houdini.
[Sickbay]
TUCKER [on monitor]: Anything else?
ARCHER: It's your turn, Trip.
TUCKER [on monitor]: Come on, Captain.
PHLOX: Commander, the virus is incompatible with carbon-based life.
It's attacking your bodies in ways I can't predict.
TUCKER [on monitor]: You think I'm going to wander off, too? Start
opening the wrong doors?
PHLOX: Not if you're sedated.
ARCHER: Sorry, Trip.
PHLOX: Commander.
[Decon chamber]
TUCKER: I'm just wondering if either one of us will
ever wake up again.
(He injects himself.)
PHLOX [OC]: You should lie down right away.
TUCKER: I won't argue with that.
[Sickbay]
(After watching Tucker collapse onto the other
bed.)
ARCHER: How close are you to stopping this?
PHLOX: T'Pol and I have isolated a specific frequency of radiation that
disrupts the silicon matrix of the virus.
ARCHER: Sounds promising.
PHLOX: Unfortunately, the dosage required would be lethal.
ARCHER: There's got to be some kind of a trade-off. A way to produce
enough radiation to slow down the virus without killing the patient.
PHLOX: That's what I'm working on.
ARCHER: Work faster.
[Bridge]
(Travis goes over to Reed's station and whispers in
his ear.)
TRAVIS: We can stop what this virus is doing to them.
REED: That's not why we're here.
TRAVIS: We came to observe their response to the unexpected, not to
watch them suffer.
REED: This is not the place to be having this discussion.
TRAVIS: I know where we can talk undisturbed.
[Decon chamber]
(The two unconscious patients sit up to talk.)
TUCKER: The sensations in this host are different from the others. I'm
experiencing physical pain.
HOSHI: So am I.
TUCKER: Why should any species have to endure this weakness?
HOSHI: Because the desire to overcome it will spur them to move beyond
the limitations of the physical world.
TUCKER: Maybe that isn't true for all species.
HOSHI: It was true for us.
[Sickbay]
(Phlox spots them on the monitor.)
PHLOX: You can't be awake.
(He checks the biosigns.)
PHLOX: Not with that much sonambutril.
(He turns on the audio.)
HOSHI [on monitor]: Our ancestors were physical beings.
TUCKER [on monitor]: Well, what worked for us might not work for
everyone. Humans have different qualities.
HOSHI [on monitor]: Nothing I haven't seen before.
TUCKER [on monitor]: What do you have against this species?
HOSHI [on monitor]: What disturbs me most about the humans is their
capacity for violence.
PHLOX: Extraordinary.
[Decon chamber]
TUCKER: Klingons embrace violence. The humans try
to avoid it.
HOSHI: Humans say they avoid it, but their words don't match.
(She looks around.)
HOSHI: We're being observed.
[Sickbay]
(The doors open.)
PHLOX: Captain, T'Pol. I was just coming to see you. These are
brainwave readings of Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato.
ARCHER: What is the significance?
PHLOX: The patterns aren't human.
T'POL: Did you know they had this capability?
ARCHER: He must have used Denobulan technology.
PHLOX: I see. Are you responsible for what happened to my patients?
ARCHER: We had nothing to do with it.
T'POL: We come here only to study how physical species react to the
unknown. You can help by telling us how you detected our presence. That
happens in less than two percent of our missions.
PHLOX: Commander Tucker and Ensign Sato were sedated. They shouldn't
have been able to stand and talk.
ARCHER: It's been so long since we had physical form, we weren't able
to distinguish sleep from sedation.
T'POL: We'll remember next time.
PHLOX: Is there anything you can do to help my patients?
T'POL: We're here to observe. We can't interfere.
PHLOX: You're interfering with me!
T'POL: Our subjects are human. You're Denobulan. You were inhabited a
few hours ago. An intriguing experience.
PHLOX: I have no recollection of that.
ARCHER: Memories are simple to adjust.
PHLOX: You're going to adjust mine again? So I won't remember a word of
this encounter.
T'POL: Or what you observed in the Decon Chamber.
PHLOX: If you have that ability, you must be able to help my patients.
ARCHER: We could.
T'POL: But we won't. Thank you for your help, Doctor.
PHLOX: No wonder you erase memories. Your behaviour is appalling.
[Corridor]
ARCHER: According to what I read on the Doctor's
medical PADD, he's learned how to stop the infection.
T'POL: I've seen seven other species develop the radiation cure. But
never in time.
ARCHER: Did we make First Contact with any of them?
T'POL: Of course not. Expending resources to attempt an impossible task
is not a sign of intelligence. The Captain and Science Officer have
decisions to make. We need to return to our original hosts.
[Situation room]
PHLOX: For the radiation to destroy the virus
without killing the patient, it must be precisely focused. The emitters
in the Decon Chamber aren't suitable, but the bio-scanner in Sickbay
is.
T'POL: To move them from Decon to Sickbay, we'll need to expand the
quarantined area.
ARCHER: That won't be a problem. We're going to make this work.
[Outside the quarantine area]
(Archer and Phlox are in EV suits.)
PHLOX: Ensign Sato's condition is deteriorating. We need to hurry.
(They go through two doors, observed by Reed and Travis on a monitor.)
ARCHER [on monitor]: Engaging quarantine.
REED: Reed to Bridge.
[Bridge]
REED [OC]: I confirm a positive seal.
T'POL: Environmental systems are isolated.
ARCHER [on monitor]: Entering the quarantine zone.
[Decon chamber]
PHLOX: She's going into oligemic shock. Captain,
she's dying.
(Archer carries Hoshi to Sickbay while Phlox helps Trip)
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: Get her on the bioscan bed.
ARCHER: She's stopped breathing.
[Outside the quarantine area]
REED: Someone always dies.
[Sickbay]
ARCHER: Hoshi. Phlox!
(Phlox is having trouble opening a case, and is about to take his glove
off.)
ARCHER: What are you doing?!
PHLOX: This equipment's not designed for EV gloves.
ARCHER: I'll be your hands.
PHLOX: No, Captain, no!
ARCHER: Right now, Enterprise needs a doctor more than it needs a
Captain.
(He takes off the gloves, and his helmet.)
PHLOX: Attach the leads twenty centimetres apart.
(Archer wires up Hoshi.)
[Outside the quarantine area]
REED: I don't understand.
TRAVIS: In eight hundred years, no one's ever done that before?
REED: No. Not once they know it's hopeless.
PHLOX: You need to inject
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: Forty units of trinephedrine into her heart.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That can't go deep enough.
(Archer gets a long-needled hypodermic.)
PHLOX: Old-fashioned, but effective. Angle it slightly more to the
right. Now, in one quick motion, insert it three centimetres.
(Archer does so.)
PHLOX: Press the activator. Clear.
(Phlox jolts her with electricity, but there's no response.)
ARCHER: Come on, Hoshi.
PHLOX: Three hundred millijoules. Captain.
ARCHER: Again!
PHLOX: Three hundred and forty. She's gone. Captain, help me with
Commander Tucker.
[Outside the quarantine area]
(They watch Archer take Hoshi off the biobed.)
TRAVIS: How many have to die before you'll admit humans are different?
We need to stop this.
REED: I will not depart from protocol. The incident isn't over. When
the first death occurs on the ship, there's a sixty eight percent
chance the rest of the crew will become infected.
TRAVIS: What more will that teach us about them?
REED: All this would have happened whether we were here or not. We are
not responsible.
TRAVIS: Maybe we should be.
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: We need to move him into the scanner.
(They do so, then take him out again shortly afterwards.)
PHLOX: It didn't work. I'm sorry, Captain.
ARCHER: Not your fault, Doctor.
PHLOX: There's nothing more I can do for Commander Tucker, but you've
still got a few hours. There has to be something else I can try.
ARCHER: You should continue your work on the Bridge. Less chance of
something going wrong with your suit.
PHLOX: I won't give up.
ARCHER: You know where to find me.
(Phlox leaves.)
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol.
[Bridge]
T'POL: T'Pol here, Captain.
(She has her back to the monitor which we can see Archer on.)
ARCHER [on monitor]: I take it you've been watching.
T'POL: I have.
ARCHER [on monitor]: Then you know you're in command?
T'POL: Yes, Captain.
ARCHER [on monitor]: I would like to think you'll stay in command.
Don't let Admiral Gardner sneak in someone over your head.
T'POL: I'll do my best.
ARCHER [on monitor]: I know you will. I need to look after Trip now.
[Sickbay]
ARCHER: We'll talk again. We'll talk again.
[Bridge]
T'POL: Captain, if Commander Tucker becomes
conscious.
ARCHER [on monitor]: I'll let you know right away. Archer out.
[Sickbay]
(Archer goes over to Tucker, who sounds as if he is
having trouble breathing. He puts his hand on his friend's chest, then
looks at the monitor. Tucker dies.)
TUCKER: I have such respect for you, Captain Archer.
(The readout still says he's dead.)
ARCHER: Trip?
TUCKER: Not exactly. I'm an Organian. a nonphysical life-form.
(He sits up.)
TUCKER: Trip is my host.
ARCHER: What did you do to him?
TUCKER: Nothing. We never interfere in the natural development of other
species. We only observe.
ARCHER: Did you know about the silicon virus?
TUCKER: That's why we come here. To see how different species react
when they encounter it.
ARCHER: You knew about the virus that killed two members of my crew,
and you didn't warn us?
TUCKER: I wanted to, but it's not up to me.
(Hoshi removes the sheet from over her head and sitting up.)
HOSHI:
You're breaking every rule we have.
TUCKER: Because they don't apply to this species.
HOSHI: That is not our decision to make.
TUCKER: If we don't challenge the rules
ARCHER: I don't care about your rules. Tell me what happens to Trip and
Hoshi when you're finished with their bodies.
HOSHI: We have to leave them as they are.
ARCHER: Dead? I understand why you won't get involved with a species'
natural development. I've faced that decision myself. It isn't an easy
one to make.
HOSHI: Then we agree.
ARCHER: No, we don't. Our encounter with the virus was an accident. one
that you could have prevented.
HOSHI: Then how would we ever learn about you?
ARCHER: Ask us. Talk to us. Just like you're doing now.
HOSHI: Talking is a limited form of communication for us. We're much
more advanced than humans.
ARCHER: Not from where I'm standing. Maybe you've evolved into beings
with abilities I can't comprehend, but you've paid a hell of a price.
You've lost compassion and empathy. Things that give life meaning. And
if that's what it takes to be advanced, I don't want any part of it.
HOSHI: We're leaving now, Captain. You won't remember a thing about our
presence. And in three hours, you'll die as well.
TUCKER: No. We have the power to save them all.
HOSHI: Are you defying me?
TUCKER: I'm defying the entire protocol. What Archer has done today,
his act of compassion, you've never witnessed that before.
HOSHI: In time, we'll study other humans.
ARCHER: There's another way. Experience compassion for yourself. You
want to know what it means to be human, you need to do more than
observe.
[Bridge]
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to the Bridge.
T'POL: T'Pol. Go ahead.
ARCHER [OC]: You wanted to know when Trip was awake.
T'POL: Yes.
ARCHER: Well, you'd better get down here because he's talking up a
storm, and so is Hoshi.
PHLOX: Captain, Hoshi's
ARCHER [OC]: You too, Phlox. Maybe one of you can tell me what the hell
just happened.
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: You're all completely free of the virus. It
has to have been a delayed reaction to Commander Tucker's radiation
treatment, but how it spilled over to you and Hoshi, I have no
explanation.
T'POL: Obviously, the pathogen's behaviour is more unpredictable than
we assumed.
ARCHER: I'm sure someone at Starfleet Medical will figure it out. But
for now, we're going to leave a warning beacon in orbit here and make
sure what happened to us never happens to anyone again.
[Turbolift]
REED: You realise the consequences of what we've
done. We will never be able to observe another species encounter this
virus.
TRAVIS: Good. I'm looking forward to making my first report. After ten
thousand years, the rules need to change.
[Corridor]
REED: These humans have not been a good influence
on you. I would not encourage further encounters.
TRAVIS: I don't think we can avoid them. I'm going to recommend that we
start preparations for an official First Contact mission.
REED: Indeed. At the rate they're progressing, that'd barely give us
five thousand years to prepare.
TRAVIS: Then we'd better get started.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Babel One
Babel One
 Mission date: Nov 12, 2154
Original Airdate: 28 Jan, 2005
  [Andorian
warship - Bridge]
 (We enter a world of tangled metal, fires, and
blue-skinned bodies slumped across consoles. One manages to get up and
activate a communications panel.)
SHRAN: Bridge to Engineering. Engineering, respond!
(No reply, so he goes to another console.)
SHRAN: This is the warship Kumari calling Imperial Command. We've been
attacked by a Tellarite vessel. Primary systems have failed! Request
immediate
(He's interrupted by an explosion.)
COMPUTER: Alert. Warp containment breach in two minutes.
SHRAN: Tellarite swine! They will pay for this. This is Shran. All crew
to the escape pods! Abandon ship.
[Ready room]
HOSHI: The food on this ship isn't fit for animals!
That mangy pet of yours would probably taste better. You can either
take me home or find a new chef, it's that simple. Oh, something else.
I want new quarters.
ARCHER: Is that so.
HOSHI: For one thing, my room is too small. There are plasma conduits
running across the ceiling. It's noisy, it keeps me up all night.
ARCHER: Maybe you'd sleep better in the Cargo bay.
HOSHI: What did you say to me?
ARCHER: This is a Starship, not a luxury liner. If you're not satisfied
with the accommodations, we can leave you behind in a shuttlepod. Maybe
you'll have better luck with whoever picks you up. And if you don't
like Chef's food, don't eat it. From the looks of things, you should
probably skip the dessert table while you're at it.
HOSHI: That was a nice touch.
ARCHER: I can't believe I'm supposed to speak to their ambassador like
that.
HOSHI: Tellarites always have a litany of complaints. It's how they
start arguments with people they've just met.
ARCHER: Even if they have nothing to complain about?
HOSHI: In that case, they'll just insult you. Whatever they say, you
have to respond in kind. Otherwise, they'll take offense.
ARCHER: A species that actually thrives on arguing. They probably make
good politicians. Thanks for the dry run.
HOSHI: Sir. I wasn't kidding about Porthos.
ARCHER: You think he's mangy?
HOSHI: No, but you might want to keep him out of sight. Tellarites
consider canines something of a delicacy.
Captain's starlog, November 12, 2154. We've arrived
in orbit of Tellar Prime. Starfleet's ordered us to transport their
ambassador to a neutral planet designated as Babel, where Earth
mediators will try to settle a long-standing trade dispute between the
Tellarites and the Andorians.
[Corridor]
ARCHER: Everything ready for our guests?
TUCKER: Well, just about. But my people are working triple shifts
trying to finish that mud bath they wanted.
ARCHER: Mud bath?
TUCKER: Apparently the ambassador likes a good soak in the morning.
Something I don't understand. These Tellarites have warp ships, so why
do we have to take them to the conference?
ARCHER: Babel's on the far side of Andorian space. They won't allow
Tellarite ships to pass through their territory.
TUCKER: Now we're a shuttle service. When are we going to get back to
exploring?
[Turbolift]
ARCHER: This trade dispute is a little more urgent.
It could turn into a shooting war if the conference fails.
[Launch bay]
(A shuttlepod has just arrived, and an honour guard
of MACOs join Archer and senior staff to welcome their guests aboard.)
ARCHER: You people are even uglier than I remember. Captain Jonathan
Archer. Welcome aboard.
GRAL: Ambassador Gral.
(The handshake turns into a test of strength.)
GRAL: I'm told this ship is the pride of Starfleet. I find it small and
unimpressive.
ARCHER: Funny. I was about to say the same thing about you.
GRAL: (smiling) You may show us to our quarters.
NAARG: It's far too cold in here. We're expected to stay on this ship
for five days?
[Mess hall]
(It's a reception for the Tellarites.)
TUCKER: So he says, 'Well, I'm not really a pilot.' Ah, you don't get
it. (Archer enters.)
ARCHER: Warm enough?
T'POL: The Ambassador requested the temperature be increased.
ARCHER: Again?
TUCKER: You know, I like these people more than I thought I would. They
don't hold anything back. It's refreshing, speaking your mind for a
change.
ARCHER: You don't feel free to speak your mind with the rest of us?
TUCKER: No, you know what I mean.
ARCHER: No. Maybe you'd like to explain it to me. Why don't you change
your uniform before you stink up the place.
TUCKER: Ah, practicing your Tellarite. I get it. (Tucker leaves, hoping he
really does get it.)
ARCHER: When in Rome.
T'POL: I beg your pardon?
ARCHER: Forget it.
T'POL: The Ambassador wants to speak with you.
ARCHER: What a surprise. (Gral is standing by a window.)
GRAL: Have we crossed into Andorian space?
ARCHER: A few minutes ago.
GRAL: The last time I was here, I was on the Command deck of one of our
cruisers, driving those blue demons back into their territory. The
Andorians came to your aid during the Xindi crisis.
ARCHER: They helped save my planet.
GRAL: So why should we trust humans to mediate this dispute? You owe
them your lives.
ARCHER: Earth wants a peaceful outcome just as much as you do. That
isn't going to happen if we choose sides.
GRAL: Your people have no experience in interstellar affairs.
ARCHER: It doesn't seem that you have a lot of other options. (Gral returns to the main table set with brightly coloured foods.)
GRAL: Your Chef obviously went to a great deal of trouble.
ARCHER: I'm told these are authentic Tellarite dishes.
GRAL: If I'd wanted to eat like this, I would've stayed at home. I was
expecting to sample Earth cuisine on this journey.
ARCHER: I'll have him whip something up.
HOSHI [OC]: Captain Archer to the Bridge.
[Bridge]
HOSHI: We've picked up a message on an Andorian
channel.
SHRAN [OC]: Kumari calling Imperial Command. Been attacked. Primary
systems have failed. Request immediate.
HOSHI: That's it.
TRAVIS: They have no ships within range.
ARCHER: How long to intercept them at maximum warp?
TRAVIS: Two hours.
ARCHER: Alter course. Contact Babel. Let them know we're going to be
delayed.
(Two hours later -)
REED: Judging by the debris pattern, I'd say their reactor breached.
T'POL: I'm detecting significant quantities of duranium alloy. This was
most likely an Andorian combat vessel.
REED: Escape pods. Multiple biosigns.
ARCHER: Bring them into the Launch bay. Tell Phlox to stand by for
casualties.
[Sickbay]
(The place is full of injured Andorians, and Shran
is keeping close watch as Phlox examines a young woman.)
PHLOX: This would be easier if you'd take a few steps back.
SHRAN: I hope you've studied Andorian physiology. (Archer and T'Pol
enter.) SHRAN: How many of my crew did you rescue?
ARCHER: Nineteen.
SHRAN: Our complement was eighty six.
ARCHER: Your distress call said you were attacked.
SHRAN: Tellarites! We were escorting our Ambassador to the trade
conference when they dropped out of warp. The Ambassador's ship was
destroyed in seconds. Tellarites crippled us with their next shot. I've
never seen one of their vessels manoeuvre like this one. While those
barbarians have been talking peace, they've obviously been improving
their warships.
T'POL: Why would the Tellarites agree to let Earth mediate your dispute
if they were planning this strike?
SHRAN: Perhaps you should ask them. I suggest you scan for our data
recorder. It'll contain the sensor logs of the attack. (T'Pol leaves.)
SHRAN: We seem to keep running into each other, Captain. It's fortunate
Enterprise was close by.
ARCHER: It's not a coincidence. We're carrying the Tellarite
delegation.
SHRAN: They're aboard this ship?
ARCHER: These aren't the people who attacked you.
SHRAN: They may know who did.
ARCHER: Shran! (Archer stops him from storming out.) ARCHER: You're on my ship.
SHRAN: You better keep them away from us or there will be bloodshed.
[Armoury]
REED: I've analysed these hull fragments. The
damage is consistent with Tellarite particle cannons.
ARCHER: What about the black box?
T'POL: The memory core was damaged, but I was able to reconstruct the
last few seconds of sensor data.
(They go over to the main monitor to view the fuzzy images.)
ARCHER: Tellarites. Set course for Andoria, best speed.
[Gral's quarters]
GRAL: These accusations are absurd. We had nothing
to do with this alleged attack.
ARCHER: The Andorian sensor logs. Look them over yourself.
GRAL: Logs can be fabricated.
ARCHER: You saw the debris field.
GRAL: For all we know, they destroyed the ship themselves. Andorian
technology is more advanced than ours. One of our cruisers wouldn't
stand a chance against two of theirs!
ARCHER: I want you to speak to your people. Find out what you can.
GRAL: I am not comfortable with so many Andorians aboard. Contact your
superiors. Have them transferred to another vessel.
ARCHER: Let's get something straight. You're just a passenger on my
ship. I give the orders.
GRAL: Where are you taking them?
ARCHER: Back to Andoria.
GRAL: You can't. They'll arrest us. They'll hold us responsible for
this incident.
ARCHER: If you're innocent, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
[Captain's mess]
(Shran and Archer are splitting a bottle of blue
Andorian Ale.)
SHRAN: To the Kumari.
ARCHER: From what I saw, she was a fine ship with a good crew.
SHRAN: I was in command for twelve years. First ship of her class. Most of
the crew I served with even longer. They were more than colleagues. I
knew their spouses, their children. I'm grateful Talas survived. If I'd
lost her
ARCHER: I didn't realise there was something going on between the two
of you.
SHRAN: It's a recent development. In the past, I never would've
considered a relationship with someone under my command.
ARCHER: What changed?
SHRAN: Andorian women are far more aggressive than Earth females. She
made an overture. I had a choice. Charge her with assaulting a superior
or mate with her.
ARCHER: I hope you made the right decision.
SHRAN: I regret that you're drawn into another of our conflicts,
Captain.
ARCHER: I seem to have a knack for it.
SHRAN: I doubt that war can be avoided this time. When that sensor data
is seen by Imperial Command.
ARCHER: It doesn't make sense. Why agree to a conference, then attack
your ambassador?
SHRAN: Tellarites don't think like you or I do. They've been provoking
us for months. We've lost six freighters along the border. We know
they're responsible.
ARCHER: Tellarites claim they've lost ships of their own.
SHRAN: You'd accept their word over ours?
T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: There's a ship on an intercept course. It's Andorian.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: You expecting company? (Shran shakes his
head.) ARCHER: Hail them.
HOSHI: They're not responding.
REED: I'm reading a power buildup. They're opening fire.
(Enterprise is rocked by multiple impacts.)
ARCHER: What the hell are they doing?
TRAVIS: Our warp field's destabilising. We're dropping to impulse.
ARCHER: Call them off.
SHRAN: Let me talk to them. This is Commander Shran of the Imperial
Guard. Call off your attack! (More weapons fire.) SHRAN: My crew is aboard this
ship. Do you hear me? Abort your attack!
ARCHER: Phase cannons, return fire!
REED: No damage.
ARCHER: We need to get through their shields. How? They're going to
kill all of us if you don't do something.
SHRAN: I need to access your targeting array. (He goes to Reed's station.)
SHRAN: These are the coordinates to their shield generator.
ARCHER: Fire when ready.
REED: Direct hit.
HOSHI: Their shields are still at maximum.
SHRAN: Impossible.
ARCHER: Shran!
(There's a big explosion on the Bridge.)
REED: Our dorsal plating's almost gone.
TRAVIS: Starboard thrusters are down.
ARCHER: Torpedoes, maximum yield.
(Another plume of flame behind them.)
TRAVIS: They're moving off.
T'POL: There's a fluctuation in their power grid.
ARCHER: Good work.
REED: That wasn't my doing, sir. I didn't target their power grid.
[Conference room]
(The lights are slightly dim, and two armed MACOs
are present.)
ARCHER: Your government asked us to be a part of a conference, and now
you're attacking us!
GRAL: This makes perfect sense, Captain. They sent a distress call to
lure you into a trap.
SHRAN: We have no argument with Starfleet.
GRAL: Your people tried to destroy this ship!
SHRAN: Captain, I assure you, what happened does not represent the will
or intent of my government.
GRAL Admit the truth. The Imperial Guard never wanted this conference
to take place. They've obviously taken matters into their own hands.
SHRAN: Are you implying the Imperial Guard's been disloyal?
GRAL: I don't have to imply anything. The facts speak for themselves.
SHRAN: That may not have been an Andorian ship.
ARCHER: What?
SHRAN: Its shield matrix had a completely different configuration.
GRAL: What is that supposed to prove?
SHRAN: Several of our warships have been reported missing over the
years. The Tellarites could have taken one of them, enhanced its
systems.
GRAL: He's suffering from paranoia, Captain.
SHRAN: I'm not paranoid. Your people are trying to kill us!
GRAL: I've had enough of your lies!
(They try to come to blows across the table, and the MACOs pull them
apart.)
ARCHER: That's enough! You want to fight, I'll throw both of you in the
Brig. You can tear each other to pieces.
[Gral's quarters]
NAARG: What happened?
GRAL: Archer claims to be impartial, but it's obvious he's inclined to
believe the Andorians. We may have made a mistake in trusting these
humans.
NAARG: They've posted soldiers outside our quarters. We're prisoners on
this ship. Have you stopped to consider Archer may be conspiring with
the Andorians?
[Situation room]
(Shran is escorted in.)
ARCHER: T'Pol's found something you're going to want to see.
T'POL: We retrieved this from your ship's data recorder. This is the
power signature of the vessel that destroyed the Kumari. This signature
belongs to the Andorian ship that attacked Enterprise.
ARCHER: They're identical.
SHRAN: That can't be correct.
T'POL: Examine the data yourself.
SHRAN: Your sensors are unsophisticated. There's been a mistake.
ARCHER: We've confirmed the data.
SHRAN: What are you suggesting? That these two vessels are actually the
same ship?
ARCHER: I don't know what I'm suggesting, but we need to keep our minds
open.
SHRAN: The Tellarites have violated every accord we've made with them.
They can't be trusted. Your desire for a peaceful resolution is
blinding you from the truth!
T'POL: Commander, perhaps
SHRAN: I've heard enough from you! Vulcans are expert liars. Perhaps
your people are behind this.
ARCHER: You're speaking to my First Officer.
TUCKER [OC]: Tucker to the Bridge.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
[Engineering]
TUCKER: Warp engines will be online in ten minutes.
We'll have hull plating back within an hour.
ARCHER [OC]: Keep me updated.
[Situation room]
ARCHER: We've located the warp trail of the ship
that attacked us. We're going to follow it.
SHRAN: Some of my crew are in serious condition. They need attention
from our physicians.
ARCHER: It'll take four days to get to Andoria. By then, that ship'll
be long gone.
[Captain's mess]
(Archer is just staring out of the window while
T'Pol eats.)
T'POL: Something wrong with your meal?
ARCHER: Just not hungry. Do you think we're moving too fast?
T'POL: Commander Tucker believes it's safe to maintain this warp
factor.
ARCHER: That's not what I meant. Earth's got a lot riding on the
outcome of these talks, but I'm not sure we knew what we were getting
into. These people have been feuding for over a century. Maybe we
should've let your government handle this.
T'POL: Although our relations have improved recently, it's clear the
Andorians don't trust us.
ARCHER: Aside from breathing oxygen, it doesn't seem to me that
Andorians and Tellarites have a hell of a lot in common.
T'POL: The same has been said about humans and Vulcans.
ARCHER: Hoshi tells me you got a transmission from Vulcan this morning.
T'POL: It was a personal message. It was from Koss. Our marriage has
been officially dissolved.
ARCHER: I'm sorry to hear that.
T'POL: You have nothing to apologise for.
REED [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Archer.
REED [OC]: I believe we've found the Andorian ship, sir.
ARCHER: We're on our way.(A very strange ship is hanging in space, looking
like a nautilus or similar, with antennae instead of tentacles.)
[Control area]
(The crew we see are Romulans, and there is someone
with a metal helmet over their head, with lots of wires attached to it.)
VALDORE: (a stocky man) Report.
NIJIL: (silver hair) I have been unable to locate the malfunction.
VALDORE: Then I suggest you double your efforts. This is enemy
territory. We can't remain here any longer without
(An alarm sounds.)
NIJIL: There's a vessel approaching.
VALDORE: Show me.
(Enterprise appears on their viewscreen.)
[Bridge]
ARCHER: You said you found the Andorians.
REED: I don't understand it, sir. The warp trail ends right here.
T'POL: Their primary systems are offline.
ARCHER: Hail them.
HOSHI: No response.
T'POL: Biosigns are indeterminate.
ARCHER: Magnify. Any idea what the spikes are?
T'POL: They appear to be subspace transceivers.
HOSHI: Why would they need so many?
T'POL: Their hull is also lined with multi-spectral emitters.
ARCHER: For what purpose?
T'POL: I prefer not to speculate.
ARCHER: (to Reed) Find out who these people are. Take a team of MACOs
with you.
REED: Their life support's offline.
ARCHER: Bring Trip along. See if he can get it working.
[Romulan ship]
(A party of four space-suited men beam aboard the 'Nautilus'.)
REED: You two, start down there.
MACO: Yes, Lieutenant.
TUCKER: This whole section's depressurized. (Reed is walking with his knees bent.)
REED: Let's hope the rest of this ship isn't
as cramped.
TUCKER: I can't read anything through these bulkheads.
REED: Stay alert.
[Command area]
(Nijil is working on the connections to the other
person's helmet.)
NIJIL: The propulsion matrix still isn't functioning.
VALDORE: How much longer?
NIJIL: The repairs are underway.
VALDORE: Prepare to overload the core.
NIJIL: What?
VALDORE: If we can't repair the matrix in time, I'll do whatever is
necessary to keep it away from Starfleet.
[Romulan ship]
TUCKER: Tucker to Enterprise.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
TUCKER: We haven't run into any welcoming parties yet. We've found a
computer interface
[Bridge]
TUCKER [OC]: But there's no power over here. I'm
going to need T'Pol's help to bring it online.
T'POL: Uplink your scanner.
[Romulan ship]
(suddenly the lights come on)
REED: What's happening?
TUCKER: I didn't do anything.
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: Sir.
(On the viewscreen, they see the ship start moving, taking pot shots at
them as it goes past.)
ARCHER: Evasive maneuvers. Get our people back.
[Romulan ship]
(The ship's extraordinary manoeuvres have everyone
falling over.)
TUCKER: Captain, we're ready to come home whenever you are!
[Bridge]
T'POL: They've reinforced their hull plating.
[Romulan ship]
T'POL [OC]: We can only transport one at a time.
TUCKER: Take Carender and Myers first!
[Bridge]
T'POL: One of the MACOs is aboard. (another bang)
They've hit our EPS couplings.
ARCHER: Switch to auxiliary. (to Reed's lady stand-in) Target their
weapons only.
(Down in the transporter alcove, the other MACO arrives just before the
device explodes.)
TRAVIS: We're losing hull plating.
HOSHI: Transporter's offline.
ARCHER: Did we get everyone?
HOSHI: Just the MACOs.
ARCHER: T'Pol.
T'POL: The primary phase coil is fused. It'll take several hours to
repair it.
HOSHI: Decompression on C deck, section three.
T'POL: We have to withdraw.
ARCHER: Archer to Trip.
[Romulan ship]
ARCHER [OC]: We've lost the transporter.
TUCKER: Understood.
ARCHER [OC]: Sit tight until we come back for you. (Reed is hanging on for grim death.)
REED: We'll be fine, sir.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Get us out of here, Travis. Maximum warp.
[Command area]
(The person in the helmet is busy moving their
fingers and turning their head.)
NIJIL: They're retreating.
VALDORE: Pursuit course.
[Romulan ship]
(The sudden turn throws Reed against some conduits,
and his air hose comes undone.)
REED: Trip!
(Tucker gets it reattached, but the dial is now down into the red.)
TUCKER: You're down to eight minutes.
(He connects his backpack and shares his air with Reed.)
REED: Thanks. We're not going to get very far only sharing your supply.
TUCKER: I'll try to get their life support online.
REED: Right. With our luck, they probably breathe fluorine.
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: Warp four point nine.
HOSHI: They're still closing.
TRAVIS: Warp five.
(Things are still going bang on the Bridge.)
T'POL: They've matched our speed.
ARCHER: Let's see what those new injectors can do
TRAVIS: Five point oh two. Point oh four. Five point oh six.
T'POL: They're falling behind.
TRAVIS: The injector's stabilised. We're holding speed.
ARCHER: Maintain your heading.
[Shran's quarters]
TALAS: You're going to wear out the deck plating.
Commander.
SHRAN: Gral knows more about these attacks than he's admitting. How can
Archer be so blind.
TALAS: We have no choice but to let him deal with the situation.
SHRAN: I'm not going to entrust the security of Andoria to the
pinkskins or anyone else. We trusted the Tellarites once. We won't make
that mistake again. With the appropriate persuasion, Gral will talk.
TALAS: I doubt Archer's capable of a thorough interrogation.
SHRAN: Then I'll have to question him myself.
TALAS: There are guards outside our quarters. We don't even know what
deck the Ambassador's on.
SHRAN: Can you bypass their security protocols?
[Romulan ship]
REED: Any luck?
TUCKER: I can't find anything that even looks like an atmosphere
recycler. I'm starting to wonder if this ship even has life support.
REED: They must have atmosphere on their Bridge.
TUCKER: Well, let's hope they don't mind sharing.
[Command area]
NIJIL: The Starfleet ship has moved out of sensor
range.
VALDORE: The humans have seen too much. We can't allow them to escape.
NIJIL: This vessel is a prototype. I told you it wasn't ready for
combat.
VALDORE: Find them!
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Our battle damage
has been repaired, and we've resumed our search for the alien vessel.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: Come in.
T'POL: I analysed the data Commander Tucker sent back. The ship doesn't
appear to be Tellarite or Andorian.
ARCHER: Do we have any idea who built it?
T'POL: There's a remote possibility. Its power matrix utilises boridium
cells. We encountered a similar technology more than two years ago.
ARCHER: The Romulan minefield. But the power cells on those mines were
much larger and more primitive.
T'POL: I did say it was a remote possibility.
ARCHER: If this is a Romulan ship, why would they be stirring up
trouble so far from home?
T'POL: They have been known to act aggressively against species they
see as a threat.
ARCHER: We've never threatened them. As far as I know, neither have the
Andorians or Tellarites. Maybe they're afraid of something else. The
species in this region have a history of not getting along. This
conference could've been the first step in changing that.
T'POL: You believe they fear an alliance?
ARCHER: The conference has been postponed indefinitely. It doesn't
sound like there's going to be an alliance any time soon. Anything from
Trip?
T'POL: We're still too far away to detect a comm. signal.
ARCHER: Well, keep me updated.
[Romulan ship]
(Tucker uses his phase pistol to cut open a door
lock.)
REED: Another access tube?
TUCKER: I'm starting to wonder if this ship even has a Bridge.
REED: Yeah.
TUCKER: Your air's down to twenty six minutes, Malcolm.
REED: Perhaps it's on one of the lower levels. There's no rule that
says the bridge has to be at the top of the ship.
TUCKER: You see these data conduits? Chances are they converge on the
Bridge.
REED: So I understand our First Officer's no longer married.
TUCKER: Yeah?
REED: Well, I was wondering what your intentions were.
TUCKER: Well, who are you, her father?
REED: No. Simply curious.
TUCKER: Malcolm! We've got something.
(They open a ceiling panel.)
REED: What is it?
TUCKER: A maneuvering thruster.
REED: Perhaps they'll be kind enough to give us the specs.
TUCKER: It's chemically fuelled. Liquid hydrogen and oxygen.
REED: We could refill our tanks.
[Shran's quarters - outside]
(The door opens to reveal Talas in pink underwear
and a classic provocative pose, one arm raised, one leg bent.)
MACO: Can I help you?
TALAS: I was hoping we could talk. I doubt you're aware of this. How
could you be? (She steps into the corridor and begins fawning on the
soldier.) TALAS: Andorian women are permitted one final conquest before their
wedding. I've never had relations with a member of your species. I was
hoping you'd indulge me.
MACO: Go back to your quarters.
TALAS: You won't even consider it?
(He hears Shran coming up behind him, and hits him, but Talas gets hold
of his rifle and disarms him. Then they have a quick fist-fight, which
she wins.)
[Command area]
VALDORE: What is it?
NIJIL: There's a problem with one of the liquid fuel tanks.
VALDORE: Another malfunction?
NIJIL: No. The starboard transfer valve has been opened manually.
VALDORE: Activate internal sensors.
[Romulan ship]
TUCKER: How are you holding up?
REED: A little light-headed.
TUCKER: That's nothing new. I should've known better.
REED: About what?
TUCKER: Getting involved with a fellow officer. There's nothing going
on between us anymore if you're interested.
REED: That's not why I asked.
TUCKER: Well, you said she had an awfully nice bum.
REED: This is true.
TUCKER: Pure oxygen. Be my guest.
(He plugs Reeds air supply into the unit.)
REED: Thanks.
(Now Tucker replenishes his own air supply.)
[Command area]
(The Romulans are moving around the surveillance
camera images until they spot our two
heroes.)
VALDORE: : Hold. Magnify that image. Humans.
NIJIL: If they make their way to the Bridge.
VALDORE: Are the inertial stabilisers offline?
NIJIL: They are.
VALDORE: (to the helmeted pilot) Evasive manoeuvres.
[Romulan ship]
(Suddenly Trip and Malcolm are shot backwards to a
bulkhead at the end of the access tube.)
REED: Magnetise your boots.
(Now they can walk again.)
[Gral's quarters]
(Shran puts his head out of a ceiling hatch and
shoots two MACOs, before dropping to the floor. A fully dressed Talas
follows him, and another Andorian.)GRAL: We mustn't be (The Andorians burst in.) GRAL: What
is this?
SHRAN: I want to know why my ship was attacked. And then you're going
to answer for your crimes against my people.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: What did you find?
T'POL: We've discovered the function of the emitters on their hull.
HOSHI: They're holographic projectors. It's a camouflage system. They
can use it to mimic the appearance of almost any ship.
ARCHER: Malcolm analysed the Andorian debris. He said that ship was
destroyed by Tellarite weapons.
T'POL: Their disruptor utilises triphasic emitters. They can simulate
different kinds of weapons.
TRAVIS: The one thing they couldn't mask is their power signature.
That's why they
CREWMAN [OC]: Security to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
CREWMAN [OC]: There's weapons fire on G deck, outside the Tellarites'
quarters.
ARCHER: On my way. Get the MACOs down there. Seal off G deck.
[Gral's quarters]
(Shran has his gun to Gral's head while Talas keeps
Naarg quiet.)
SHRAN: We know your government's behind the disappearance of our
freighters.
GRAL: We had nothing to do with that!
SHRAN: You may have been able to convince Archer, but I'm not so
gullible. I don't know a lot about Starfleet weapons, but I believe
this setting will bore right through that thick hide of yours. The
truth. Now!
[Gral's quarters]
(In the corridor, MACOs and Andorians are fighting a running battle,
and Starfleet win. Archer and the MACOs enter, guns ready.)
SHRAN: Stay out of this, pinkskin.
ARCHER: Shran, listen to me. The ship that attacked you wasn't
Tellarite.
SHRAN: I was there!
ARCHER: I can prove it was someone else. (He lowers his phase pistol.)
ARCHER: You're both being set up. Your ship was attacked because someone didn't
want this conference to go forward.
SHRAN: Who?
ARCHER: I'm asking you, one captain to another. Look at the evidence
before you do something you're going to regret.
(Shran deactivates the phase rifle and hands it over. Naarg takes
advantage of Talas' distraction to grab her weapon and shoot her with
it. A MACO shoots him in return.) ARCHER: Get Phlox down here.
TALAS: How bad?
SHRAN: It's only superficial. You'll be fine.
[Romulan ship]
TUCKER: The Bridge should be through there.
(They go through the hatch into a dark, airless, unpopulated Bridge,
with just a few consoles lit up and a
weird contraption moving from side to side in the middle, mirroring the
movements of the helmeted person.)
[Control area]
NIJIL: They've entered the Bridge.
(The camera pulls back to reveal that the Romulans are actually in a
building, in a city, on a planet.)

 Original Airdate: 4 Feb, 2005
  ARCHER:
Previously on Enterprise

TUCKER [Romulan ship]: I'm
starting to wonder if the ship even has life support.
REED: They must have atmosphere on their Bridge.
VALDORE [Control area]: The
humans have seen too much. We can't allow them to escape.
 ARCHER: (Enterprise is under attack) Evasive
manoeuvres. Get our people back. Did we get everyone?
T'POL: Just the MACOs.
ARCHER [Romulan ship] [OC]:
Trip, we've lost the transporter. Sit tight until we come back for you.
TUCKER: Understood.
ARCHER [Ready room]: If
this is a Romulan ship, why would they be stirring up trouble so far
from home?
SHRAN [Gral's quarters]: (with
a gun to Gral) Stay out of this, pinkskin.
ARCHER: Shran, listen to me. The ship that attacked you wasn't
Tellarite. You're both being set up. Someone didn't want this
conference to go forward.
(Naarg shoots Talas and gets shot himself.)
NIJIL [Romulan ship] [OC]:
They've entered the Bridge.
TUCKER: There's no one here.
(The ship continues to be thrown around, trying to kill the intruders.)
[Control area]
NIJIL: They won't last much longer.
VALDORE: It'll have to wait. We're approaching our next target.
NIJIL: Stabilise the Drone for battle. Activating the holographic skin.
VALDORE: Use this configuration.
[Romulan ship]
TUCKER: You still in one piece?
REED Yeah, I'll let you know when my head stops spinning.
TUCKER: Feel that? We're dropping out of warp.
[Control area]
NIJIL: Target acquired.
VALDORE: Engage visual sensors.
NIJIL: The Rigelians are hailing us.
VALDORE: Answer them.
[Romulan ship]
TUCKER: We're firing at someone.
REED: Well, brace yourself. Whoever it is, they'll be sure to fire
back.
(There's a bang.)
[Control area]
NIJIL: The Drone is taking damage.
VALDORE: Give the Rigelians time to send their distress call. Now
destroy them.
(We see Enterprise blow the Rigelian ship to pieces and sail serenely
through the debris.)
Captain's starlog, supplemental. For now, the truce
between the Andorians and Tellarites on Enterprise is holding. But
Starfleet has informed me of a new diplomatic crisis.
[Situation room]
ARCHER: It was a heavily-armed scoutship with a
crew of seventeen. There were no survivors.
TRAVIS: Why does Starfleet think this is connected to the other
incidents?
ARCHER: Rigelians transmitted a visual record of the ship that attacked
them.
(A grainy image of Enterprise is put on the monitor.)
ARCHER: I'm told their Trade Commission is demanding compensation, and
my arrest. Whoever's behind these attacks, they're trying to do more
than provoke a war between Andorians and Tellarites. This is an attempt
to destabilise the entire region. We need to find the marauder before
it attacks again.
T'POL: I've found a way to detect their warp signature. And Travis
designed a sensor grid that should extend our range.
ARCHER: How many ships will it take to make this work?
T'POL: Only one hundred and twenty eight.
ARCHER: There's just one way we can get that many ships to help us.
[Sickbay]
SHRAN: Talas.
TALAS: Have you come to take me home?
SHRAN: I think this Denobulan doctor is secretly in love with you. He
wants to keep you to himself.
TALAS: You said my wound was superficial.
SHRAN: You were only grazed, but the phase pistol was set to kill.
TALAS: That Tellarite pig.
SHRAN: Is there any other kind?
TALAS: I've seen what phase-pulse infection can do to Andorians.
SHRAN: You're going to be fine. We'll be home soon, the two of us.
TALAS: Don't let me die unavenged.
SHRAN: I won't.
PHLOX: I'm sorry. She needs to rest.
SHRAN: See what I mean? He can't get enough of you. I'm jealous.
(He backs away from her bed, and Phlox draws the curtain so she can't
hear them.)
SHRAN: Doctor.
(Archer enters.)
ARCHER:
How is she?
SHRAN: Lucky to be alive.
ARCHER: I have a proposal.
SHRAN: If it involves killing Tellarites, I'm all for it.
[Control area]
VRAX: (not in a military uniform) Your ship is
adrift in enemy space, damaged and defenceless, because of a single
Rigelian scoutship? Is that what you want me to report to the Senate?
VALDORE: The Drone has taken damage before. It's designed to
self-repair.
VRAX: If our enemies find it.
VALDORE: That's the point of this project. No prisoners to capture, no
bodies to recover. These Drone ships can never be traced back to us.
VRAX: This prototype's a modified warbird. The Vulcans would identify
it the moment they inspected the propulsion matrix.
VALDORE: The Vulcans won't get anywhere near it.
VRAX: Don't underestimate our distant brothers. Bring your ship home.
I'll tell the Senate that your test has been a success. Otherwise,
they'll make someone pay for this failure.
(He opens the door and we see two Remans waiting for the Senator.)
VRAX: And I promise you, it won't be me. Jolan tru, Admiral.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: Come in.
(T'Pol enters.)
ARCHER: Admiral Gardner just called. He's sending every ship available,
but at top speed it'll take weeks for most of them to get here.
T'POL: What about Columbia?
ARCHER: She's stuck in dry dock. Engine trouble. Did you get through to
your people?
T'POL: Minister T'Pau is dispatching twenty three vessels.
ARCHER: That's all?
T'POL: The High Command has been disbanded. Many of our ships no longer
have full crew compliments.
ARCHER: T'Pau could have picked a better time to clean house.
T'POL: (seeing his desk monitor) Andorian and Tellarite fleet
deployments?
ARCHER: I'm thinking of asking them to join us. Without more ships, our
sensor net's going to have a gaping hole. The marauder could fly right
through it, and we'd never know.
T'POL: Have you discussed this with Commander Shran, or Ambassador
Gral?
ARCHER: Not yet.
T'POL: Even if both sides were to agree, which seems unlikely, their
deployments would have to be co-ordinated, a command hierarchy
established.
ARCHER: An Andorian captain might have a problem taking orders from a
Tellarite?
T'POL: Precisely.
ARCHER: There's one species that's on friendly terms with both of them.
Humans. Enterprise could serve as the command ship, relaying all
orders. The other ships would only have to exchange communication
codes.
T'POL: It might work.
ARCHER: You don't sound too optimistic.
T'POL: These have four species have never co-operated on a mutual
endeavour.
ARCHER: As far as I know, no one's ever tried to get them together
before. From what I've heard about these Romulans, they mean business.
If they're behind these attacks, we have to find some way to stop them,
or next time, they might come back with a thousand of those ships.
[Romulan ship]
REED: Some of these circuits are live, but I don't
know what they're for.
TUCKER: And I can't figure out what half this stuff is.
REED: What about the other half?
TUCKER: Well, I think I found an environmental system.
REED: That'd make sense. These consoles look like crew stations.
TUCKER: Here goes.
(He activates a circuit, and something comes to life.)
TUCKER: Well, how about that. In a few minutes, we'll have heat and
air.
REED: Do you think it's possible that there's no one else on board?
TUCKER: Why would a robot ship have a Bridge like this?
REED: It could be a prototype. Outfit an existing ship with the latest
in computer controls.
TUCKER: Well, that'd make things a whole lot easier for us.
REED: How's that?
TUCKER: If this ship's run by computer, what we need to do is find the
off switch.
[Conference room]
SHRAN: I'd rather co-habit with Klingon targs than
join forces with Tellarites.
GRAL: Your personal mating preference is no concern of mine.
(The pair square up to each other across the table, and Archer waves
the MACOs away.)
ARCHER: If you're waiting for me to stop you, don't worry. I won't.
SHRAN: You heard what he said.
ARCHER: And I heard what you said. So now it's time for both of you to
listen to me. Instead of insulting you to make you feel at home, and
putting up with your arrogance as a sign of my respect, why don't the
two of you try behaving like humans for a change?
GRAL: And you said you wouldn't be insulting.
(The pair sit as Archer stands.)
ARCHER: There's one thing humans seem to do better than any species
we've met. When we're faced with a common threat, we put our
differences aside and try to co-operate. Someone is determined to start
a war in this region. I've shown you how we can stop them. But if you
don't understand that, feel free to strangle each other. Just remember,
that's exactly what this marauder wants you to do.
[Romulan ship]
(Tucker and Reed have taken their helmets off now.)
REED: We've gone back to warp.
TUCKER: Just when it happened, I got a power spike from one of these
conduits.
REED: Do you think warp control runs through here?
TUCKER: If this ship was originally built for a crew, all of its
controls should connect to the Bridge. Maybe they never got
disconnected. Keep your eyes on these consoles.
(A monitor screen comes to life.)
REED: Did you do that?
TUCKER: Even money we just found their propulsion controls.
[Control area]
VALDORE: What are they doing?
NIJIL: I can't tell for sure. Visual surveillance is offline. The Drone
is dropping out of warp.
[Romulan ship]
REED: You've found the off switch?
TUCKER: All I did was interrupt the power to the warp controls. There's
probably a backup that'll switch on in a few minutes.
(Reed looks at the monitor display.)
REED:
Can you make any sense of this?
TUCKER: Where's Hoshi when you need her?
REED: That's where we are.
TUCKER: I'm going to guess that's the power circuit I just shut down.
REED: If this were Enterprise, that'd be the power coupling for the
entire warp control system, including the backups.
TUCKER: Should be right through there.
(He touches the monitor, and a door opens.)
REED: Maestro.
[Control area]
NIJIL: One of them's left the Bridge. He's in the
service junction.
VALDORE: Why?
NIJIL: It appears he's located the main coupling for the warp matrix.
VALDORE: What else is in there?
NIJIL: Just what we need to kill him.
[Romulan ship]
(Reed can see Tucker in the service junction.)
TUCKER: Okay, Malcolm, I'm going to flip through these like circuit
breakers. Let me know how the diagram changes.
REED: Ready when you are.
TUCKER: There's the first one.
REED: It went out.
[Control area]
NIJIL: He's disabling the warp system.
VALDORE: Is self-repair still activated?
NIJIL: It'll take more than a day to reroute the major circuits.
VALDORE: We don't have a day.
NIJIL: One of them is still in the service junction.
VALDORE: Seal him in.
[Romulan ship]
TUCKER: I'm going to see if there's a
communications circuit we can tap into.
(The doorway closes between them.)
TUCKER: Malcolm! (into communicator) Malcolm, did you touch something?
REED: Wasn't me.
(They both try the door controls.)
TUCKER: Do the hatch controls work on your side?
REED: Negative. They're not responding.
(Trying to push the door open fails too.)
VALDORE [OC]: Listen carefully, and you won't be harmed.
REED: Who are you?
[Control area]
VALDORE: I control the ship.
[Romulan ship]
TUCKER: Not anymore, you don't.
{Reed hears something being switched on.)
REED: Commander, what's happening?
TUCKER: (now bathed in a yellowy light) Reactor coolant. Radiation's at
a hundred roentgens and climbing.
VALDORE [OC]: That gives you seven minutes, Commander. Re-establish the
warp matrix, or you will die.
[Ready room]
SHRAN: (handing over a PADD) Compliments of the
Imperial Guard. These are the communication codes we'll use for the
joint operation.
ARCHER: Gral's informed me that the Tellarites are also taking part, so
they'll need these codes as well.
SHRAN: Do what you have to.
ARCHER: I appreciate your cooperation.
SHRAN: You're not especially difficult to work with, Captain. Unlike
Tellarites, you understand ethics and try to live by them.
ARCHER: Try?
SHRAN: Well, nobody's perfect. Have you served on all these vessels?
ARCHER: A few of them are a bit before my time, but they were all named
Enterprise. This one sailed Earth's oceans almost four hundred years
ago.
SHRAN: My vessel, the Kumari, was named for the first ice-cutter to
circumnavigate Andoria. Perhaps future ships will be named after our
vessels, especially if we do something historic together.
ARCHER: There's no reason our people can't become allies.
SHRAN: Agreed.
(They shake hands.)
[Romulan ship]
TUCKER: Pay attention to that board, Malcolm. I'm
going to try to cut power to the reactor.
REED: I've got a better idea. Make sure you're well away from the door.
[Control area]
VALDORE: You're wasting time, Commander. The
radiation will be fatal in three minutes.
[Romulan ship]
VALDORE [OC]: I can save you.
(While Reed tries firing his phase pistol at the door, Tucker is
pulling crystals from panels.)
TUCKER: Malcolm, what happened to the board?
REED: Everything's off.
TUCKER: That's more like it. Radiation's falling.
[Control area]
NIJIL: They've taken the reactor offline.
VALDORE: Activate the backup sequencer.
[Romulan ship]
(The yellow lights come back on again.)
VALDORE [OC]: I'm still in control. There is nothing you can do to save
your life
[Control area]
VALDORE: Except follow my instructions.
[Bridge]
T'POL: We've received the final confirmations. All
one hundred and twenty eight ships are in position.
PHLOX [OC]: Phlox to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Go ahead. PHLOX [OC]: I require you in Sickbay as soon as
possible.
[Sickbay]
(Archer is already there with Phlox, in front of
the closed curtain, when Shran bursts in with his MACO shadow.)
SHRAN: No.
PHLOX: I did everything I could.
SHRAN: You said she'd recover.
ARCHER: Shran.
(He goes into the cubicle and weeps over her body.)
SHRAN: No.
[Romulan ship]
(Tucker is ripping out every wire and crystal he
can lay his hands on.)
REED: Commander, what's your status?
TUCKER: I should've brought my helmet. Radiation's at one eighty and
climbing. I can't shut it down.
[Command area]
VALDORE: You don't have to die like this.
[Romulan ship]
TUCKER: You're not getting this ship back.
VALDORE [OC]: You're wrong, Commander.
[Control area]
VALDORE: Eventually it will repair itself.
[Romulan ship]
VALDORE [OC]: You'll have died for nothing.
REED: All right. I'll reconnect the matrix. Open the hatch!
TUCKER: Malcolm, no! That's an order!
(TUcker collapses. Reed works at
the panel.)
REED: Commander?
VALDORE [OC]: Do your duty, Malcolm.
[Control area]
VALDORE: Restore the matrix. Save your commander's
life.
[Conference room]
(There's an intricate lacework design on the main
monitor screen.)
GRAL: There. Every Tellarite ship is connected to your sensor network,
despite the inefficient Andorian codes.
ARCHER: Now comes the hard part. We have to sit and wait.
NAARG: We're not a patient people.
ARCHER: I've noticed. Maybe that's something we can work
(The door bursts open and the MACOs bar Shran's way.)
SHRAN: I only want to talk to him! I only want to talk.
ARCHER: We're listening.
(The Tellarites sit, and the MACOs come in to keep an eye on things.)
SHRAN: You (indicating Naarg) need to know about Talas, the woman you
killed.
NAARG: She attacked us.
SHRAN: The attack was over when you shot her, but I'm not here to argue
that. Her family was privileged, her parents wealthy. She could've
chosen any career, never known discomfort. But she felt the call of
duty. She pledged her life to the Imperial Guard. Talas could've had
anything. Anyone. She chose me. I just wanted you to know.
(Shran reaches into his pocket, but Archer stops him and takes out the
bottle himself. He opens it to smell it.)
SHRAN: It's her blood. When a Guardsman dies far from home, his
companions, her companions, carry part of her back to the ice of
Andoria. I wanted you to know that, too
(He grabs Naarg's hand and pours some of the blood on it before Archer
drags him off.)
SHRAN: Before you die!
ARCHER: That's enough!
SHRAN: Not until his blood pays for hers!
NAARG: Keep him away!
SHRAN: You will face justice at my hands!
ARCHER: That's not going to happen on my ship.
SHRAN: Yes, it will, pinkskin, because if you and the Tellarites don't
show respect for Andorian tradition, the Imperial Guard will withdraw
its ships.
ARCHER: What tradition?
SHRAN: Unless this murderer meets me in combat, your precious alliance
is finished!
[Romulan ship]
REED: I'm reconnecting the warp matrix!
[Control area]
REED [OC]: Shut off the radiation!
VALDORE: When you're finished.
[Romulan ship]
REED: There! Now shut it off! And open this hatch!
(The hatch opens and Reed takes the two suit helmets in with him. He helps
Tucker sit up.)
REED: Commander, stay with me.
[Control area]
NIJIL: The matrix has been reactivated.
VALDORE: Then we don't need the humans anymore.
[Romulan ship]
(Tucker and Reed have their helmets back on when
the door closes, locking them into the service junction.)
TUCKER: Why didn't you listen to me?
REED: We're better off here than on the Bridge.
(We get to see what the Romulans don't know - a phase pistol set to
overload lodged in the power conduit panel.)
[Control area]
VALDORE: Take it to warp. Set a course for home.
[Romulan ship]
TUCKER: We're back at warp. I ordered you not to
help them.
REED: I apologise for saving your life, Commander. It won't happen
again.
TUCKER: Sorry.
(Reed is undoing the nuts around another circular feature.)
REED: According
to the bridge schematic, this is an access panel.
TUCKER: Where's it lead?
REED: Away from the Bridge.
TUCKER: What does that give us?
REED: We should assume that we're being monitored. Did you ever read
the manual that came with that thing?
(Tucker looks down at his phase pistol, then Malcolm turns to show his
holster is empty.)
REED: The warning about inadvertent overload?
TUCKER: How long does it take?
REED: By now, less than a minute.
(Tucker joins him in getting the panel open.)
[Control area]
VALDORE: What access panel are they talking about?
NIJIL: It leads into the superstructure, away from any critical
equipment.
VALDORE: We'll deal with them when the Drone returns.
[Romulan ship]
(They get the panel off, and break through big
tubes to get through into the corridor and away from the impending
explosion.)
TUCKER: We've got to be a safe distance by now.
[Control area]
REED [OC]: I wired it directly into the power
conduit.
(There's a very big bang, the hull of the modified warbird is breached,
and the monitors in the control area revert to the Romulan symbol as
Nijil's console goes blank.)
NIJIL: We've lost contact.
[Ready room]
HOSHI: The Andorian tradition Shran wants to follow
is called the Ushann. Basically, it's a duel to the death.
T'POL: The combatants fight with these.
(An almost semicircular blade with a wicked
serrated edge.)
T'POL: It's called an Ushann-Tor.
HOSHI: It's an ice-miner's tool. Andorians play with them as children.
A Tellarite won't stand a chance using one against Shran.
ARCHER: I don't think that's going to be an issue. Ambassador Gral's
refusing to let Naarg fight.
T'POL: Andorians will consider that a further insult.
ARCHER: What else do we know about this tradition?
[Shran's quarters]
(Shran is sharpening his blade when Archer comes
in.)
SHRAN: Please, make yourself at home. An old friend. I carry it
everywhere.
ARCHER: Two hours ago, we spoke about a new partnership between Andoria
and Earth.
SHRAN: A benefit to both our worlds.
ARCHER: You're throwing it away for personal vengeance.
SHRAN: There's more to this than Talas. I lost my ship, almost my
entire crew. If I do nothing to avenge these losses, what kind of
leader am I? Why should any soldier follow me again? Besides, you
should be wishing me luck. I provide a voice for your species at the
Imperial Guard. I'm valuable to humans.
ARCHER: I spoke to Ambassador Gral about the rules of the Ushann.
Specifically, the right of substitution.
SHRAN: The Ambassador's decided to fight in place of his underling?
ARCHER: Not the Ambassador.
SHRAN: You wouldn't.
ARCHER: I'm the substitute. You're going to have to fight me.
SHRAN: I'm going to have to kill you. You're my friend.
ARCHER: Then call it off.
SHRAN: I can't.
[Romulan ship]
(Moving quickly through a tangled mess of dangling
stuff and small explosions.)
TUCKER: You did all this with one phase pistol?
REED: You're good at building things. I'm good at blowing them up.
TUCKER: I'm thinking we should get to the outer hull.
REED: No, we might be safer trying to find another area with
life-support.
TUCKER: The hull's covered with subspace transceivers. If I can link
one of them to our communicators, we might be able to contact
Enterprise.
[Control area]
(The console lights up again.)
NIJIL: Admiral, the Drone's restored contact. The
repair systems are starting to work.
VALDORE: It'll take days. Let me know when it's restored its ability to
self-destruct.
[Archer's quarters]
ARCHER: Come in.
T'POL: Updating your will?
ARCHER: You expect me to lose?
T'POL: Shran is a member of the Imperial Guard, trained in combat from
childhood. He won't back down.
ARCHER: He can't. I understand.
T'POL: If you back down, the Imperial Guard will withdraw their ships.
ARCHER: If I kill Shran, or one of the Tellarites does, the Andorians
will pull out anyway. The Tellarites'll do the same thing if Shran
kills one of them. So, I'm the only one who can be killed, because
Starfleet won't withdraw. This operation is important, considering that
it might lead to an alliance of planets.
T'POL: Vulcans have a saying. One man can summon the future. What
happens if that man throws away his life before his time?
ARCHER: If I've learned anything these past few years on Enterprise,
it's that the future isn't fixed.
T'POL: If anything happens to you.
ARCHER: Then I'd better make sure that nothing does.
[Bridge]
(Hoshi is still at her station, going through
Andorian documents.)
TRAVIS: Didn't expect to find you up this late.
HOSHI: What are you doing here?
TRAVIS: Too wired to sleep. Hard to believe the Captain's going to be
fighting a duel to the death in a few hours.
HOSHI: Barbaric, if you ask me.
TRAVIS: What are you looking at?
HOSHI: Code of the Ushann. T'Pol wants me to go over it again. See if I
can find a way out of this mess.
TRAVIS: The last I heard, the Captain sounded determined to go through
with it.
HOSHI: She wants me to find a loophole. Some way to forfeit without
offending the Andorians.
TRAVIS: Two of us could get through that a lot faster.
[Mess hall]
(The table is covered in PADDs.)
TRAVIS: Look at this. Either combatant can postpone a duel indefinitely
if there are no children to continue his clan.
HOSHI: How does that help us?
TRAVIS: As far as I know, Captain Archer doesn't have any kids. If he's
killed, his clan would die with him.
HOSHI: That rule only applies if he's married.
TRAVIS: Don't suppose we can find him a wife in the next four hours.
HOSHI: Even if we could, something tells me the Andorians would cry
foul. There are twelve thousand amendments to this ridiculous honour
code. There has got to be one that can get him out of this.
TRAVIS: Instead of looking for a loophole, maybe we should be trying to
find a way for the Captain to win.
HOSHI: If the Captain wins, Shran's dead. The alliance falls apart.
TRAVIS: Have you ever been to Nobelia Prime?
HOSHI: Not recently.
TRAVIS: The tribal elders there, they can challenge you to a duel if
you look at them the wrong way. Happened to my father.
HOSHI: How did he get out of it?
TRAVIS: Which one of these has the combat rules?
[Cargo bay]
(Both sides have assembled, and Hoshi is giving a
last minute lesson on how to use the Ushann Tor.)
HOSHI: Don't try and block with this. When he swings, intercept,
deflect, and hook it away.
GRAL: Better to insert between the eyes and twist.
PHLOX: Andorian metabolism is higher than humans'. Keep moving, you'll
exhaust him.
ARCHER: How about I just win?
T'POL: Take your places. There is still time to end this.
SHRAN: It can only end one way. This is not what I wanted.
ARCHER: Things have a way of turning out differently than we expect.
SHRAN: I'm glad we met. In your honour, I'll continue to support
co-operation between the Imperial Guard and your species.
ARCHER: Let's get this over with. I got a ship to run.
(The metal 'shields' on their left hands are chained together.)
SHRAN: I'll take your blood to Andoria, to the Wall of Heroes.
ARCHER: Not today.
SHRAN: You have the first move.
(The fight begins, with neither holding back. Shran draws first blood.)
SHRAN: Give up. A single stroke, and there'll be no pain.
ARCHER: You think I'm losing? I'm just trying to make you look good in
front of your soldiers.
(Archer manages to get the chain around Shran's throat.)
ARCHER: Now do you give up?
SHRAN: (being strangled) Never!
ARCHER: Wrong choice.
(He brings the Ushann Tor down in a fast, vicious blow.)
[Sickbay]
(Shran is still alive, but missing an antenna.)
SHRAN: You should've cut off my head.
ARCHER: I considered it, but I still need your help.
(Shran stumbles off the bed and looking at his reflection.)
SHRAN:
What good is a Guardsman without two antennae?
PHLOX: You'll begin to compensate within a day or two.
SHRAN: They take nine months to grow back.
PHLOX: If left untreated. With electrical stimulation and brisk cranial
massage, you'll be back to normal in half that time.
ARCHER: I was told that the loss of an antenna wasn't critical.
SHRAN: You humiliated me.
ARCHER: And that the Ushann is settled when one fighter is rendered
defenceless. Are we done?
SHRAN: You respected Andorian tradition. It's settled.
T'POL [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
[Bridge]
T'POL: Four ships have located the marauder's power
signature.
ARCHER: Can you pick up biosigns?
T'POL: Not at this distance.
ARCHER: Travis, plot an intercept course. Take us to maximum warp.
TRAVIS: Intercept in forty seven minutes.
ARCHER: Alert the fleet.
[Command area]
NIJIL: The Drone's sensors have detected
Enterprise. It's closing.
VALDORE: Activate the holographic skin.
[Romulan ship]
TUCKER: Something's starting to draw a lot of
power. It's all those systems that went down in the explosion. They're
coming back online.
REED: What about the warp matrix?
TUCKER: Not yet, but if you want to contact Enterprise, we'd better
hurry.
[Bridge]
T'POL: Approaching visual range.
ARCHER: On screen. Magnify.
(And the image they see is -)
SHRAN: Vulcan?
ARCHER: Check their power signature.
T'POL: It doesn't match.
ARCHER: Tactical alert. Charge weapons.
[Control area]
NIJIL: Enterprise will reach the Drone before the
matrix is restored.
(The door opens, and Vrax enters.)
VALDORE: Senator, I was not told of your visit.
VRAX: You allowed our enemies to board and disable the Drone. I have my
sources, Admiral.
VALDORE: Then you know we are about to engage the human ship.
VRAX: I'm here to witness its destruction.
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: One minute.
T'POL: (at Reed's station) We have biosigns. Two humans.
ARCHER: Can you get a transporter lock?
T'POL: We'll need to be much closer.
ARCHER: Open a channel. Archer to Tucker and Reed. Respond.
REED [OC]: We're both here, Captain.
[Control area]
VALDORE: Fire.
[Bridge]
(There's a big bang close to T'Pol, who nearly
falls off her chair.)
ARCHER: Target its weapons.
T'POL: I can't get a lock through the camouflage.
ARCHER: Take out the emitters, but don't puncture the hull.
(Enterprise swoops in, and the image of the ship fluctuates as the
shots hit their targets, until it becomes its true self.)
[Romulan ship]
(Where things are also going bang.)
REED: They do know we're on board?
TUCKER: They're probably trying to take out the weapons. Enterprise
[Bridge]
TUCKER [OC]: Any chance of using the transporter?
ARCHER: You have to get closer to the hull.
[Romulan ship]
ARCHER [OC]: Can you do that?
TUCKER: We're on our way.
[Control area]
NIJIL: We've lost the emitters.
VALDORE: Warp status?
NIJIL: Two minutes. More enemy ships are closing. If Enterprise stops
the self-repair sequence.
VRAX: The Drone will escape.
(It certainly manages to dodge two torpedoes, thanks to not bothering
about inertial stabilisers.)
[Romulan ship]
TUCKER: Enterprise, we're at the hull!
[Bridge]
TUCKER: The ship's movement is too erratic. I can't
get a lock.
TRAVIS: They're targeting our warp core. Hull plating's at forty three
percent. (another bang) Thirty six percent.
ARCHER: Shut down weapons. All power to hull plating. Travis, bring us
about. Trip, Malcolm, we can make one more pass. Get the hell out of
there.
[Control area]
NIJIL: Their weapons are offline. They're
vulnerable.
[Romulan ship]
(Tucker and Reed open an airlock.)
REED: I can't imagine how things could get much worse!
TUCKER: I can.
(They leap into space.)
[Bridge]
T'POL: They're clear. (another bang) Sensors are
down. I've lost them.
[Control area]
NIJIL: Six more enemy ships within range.
VALDORE: Twenty seconds to warp.
[Bridge]
HOSHI: We've got company, alliance ships.
ARCHER: Tell them not to fire. Our people are out there.
[Control area]
NIJIL: The matrix is restored.
VALDORE: Withdraw.
[Space]
(The little ship warps away, and the big Vulcan
ship and its companions go after it.)
REED: They left us. You were right. This is worse.
ARCHER [OC]: Anyone out there need a lift?
(Enterprise sails up and beams them onboard.)
[EV suit lockers]
REED: If I had to wear this helmet for one more
minute, I swear it would've fused to my skull. I tell you, I'd like to
find the designer of this suit and make him wear it for three days.
TUCKER: Yeah. Thanks for what you did back there.
REED: Yeah, you would've done the same for me.
TUCKER: No, you took a big chance. Which makes what I have to do all
the more difficult. I'm putting you on report.
REED: You're what?
TUCKER: You disobeyed a direct order.
REED: I saved your life! If you put a reprimand in my file, it could be
years before I'm even eligible for
(He sees the grin growing on Tucker's face.)
REED: Are you pulling my leg?
TUCKER: (finally laughing out loud) Malcolm, you're just such an easy
target.
[Conference room]
ARCHER: The marauder got away. One of the Tellarite
ships was hit. An Andorian warship rescued the crew.
SHRAN: So, it's still out there. As you said, a common threat.
GRAL: I believe we have more to discuss than trade disputes.
(Gral offers his hand, and Shran takes it.)
ARCHER: Why wait until we get to Babel?
[Control area]
NIJIL: The Drone has re-entered Romulan space.
VALDORE: Disconnect the pilot.
(The helmet is lifted to show us - a white-skinned, blind Andorian.)

The Enterprise Transcripts - The Aenar
The Aenar
 Original Airdate: 11 Feb, 2005
  T'POL:
Previously on Enterprise.
ARCHER [Ready
room]: From what I've heard about these Romulans, they
mean business. We have to find some way to stop them, or next time they
might come back with a thousand of those ships.
SHRAN [Conference room]: Unless
this murderer meets me in combat, your precious alliance is finished!
SHRAN [Shran's quarters]: The
Ambassador's decided to fight in place of his underling?
ARCHER: Not the Ambassador.
(Shots from the fight, and then a shot of the airlock on the Romulan
ship opening.)
ARCHER [Bridge]: Trip,
Malcolm, we can make one more pass. Get the hell out of there.
T'POL: They're clear.
NIJIL [Control area]: The
Drone has re-entered Romulan space.
VALDORE: Disconnect the pilot.
(We see the blind, white-skinned Andorian.)
GRAL [Conference room]:
I believe we have more to discuss than trade disputes.
ARCHER [OC]: There's no reason our people can't become allies.
T'POL [OC]: And now, the conclusion.
[Control area]
VRAX: This mission was supposed to cause dissension
in the region. It's had the opposite effect.
VALDORE: Senator, you have a right
VRAX: The Andorians and Tellarites have formed an alliance. They're
working together for the first time in history.
VALDORE: It won't last.
VRAX: The group of senators doesn't share your optimism. They're
presenting a motion to cancel this mission.
VALDORE: That would be a mistake.
VRAX: The mistake was mine when I supported this endeavour. Do you
realise how you've weakened my position?
VALDORE: When this is over, you'll be First Consul.
VRAX: After a failure of this magnitude, I could be dead.
VALDORE: This isn't a failure. It's a setback. We have to deal with the
humans. They are the ones that brought the Andorians and Tellarites
together. The second Drone ship is armed and ready for battle. With two
ships, I can deliver a devastating blow. We will hunt down Enterprise
and destroy it.
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. A transport ship
is returning the Tellarite Ambassador to his homeworld, but Shran has
offered to stay and help us track down the marauder.
[Conference room]
T'POL: The Drone is being operated by telepresence.
It's a process which allows a vessel to be controlled from a remote
location.
SHRAN: We experimented with that years ago. Nothing came of it.
T'POL: A pilot can operate the Drone from a great distance, over many
light years.
REED: So, there really was no one on that ship.
TUCKER: And the people running it are back on their homeworld, safe and
sound.
T'POL: Essentially.
TUCKER: Doesn't seem fair.
ARCHER: Is there any way to interrupt this telepresence?
T'POL: I'm still reviewing the data Commander Tucker brought back, but
I believe we can construct our own telepresence unit.
TUCKER: And use it to hijack their ship?
T'POL: Doubtful. The most we can hope for is to interfere with their
navigation.
ARCHER: Get started.
T'POL: There is one problem. The data from the marauder also contained
a brain wave pattern. I believe it belongs to the pilot.
PHLOX: I've analyzed it. The individual is highly telepathic.
T'POL: Apparently, telepathy is necessary to operate the device.
ARCHER: Vulcans have telepathic powers.
PHLOX: Not to this extent.
ARCHER: Can you identify the species?
PHLOX: There's no exact match in my database. However, the nearest
genome is Andorian.
[Control area]
NIJIL: The humans did considerable damage to the
Bridge. We'll have to replace the entire receiver array.
VALDORE: Assign every spare man to the repair crew.
NIJIL: The ship isn't what concerns me. It's the pilot.
VALDORE: What about him?
NIJIL: Operating the vessel is extremely taxing.
VALDORE: He'll have at least three days to rest.
NIJIL: That won't be enough. He's suffering from severe mental fatigue.
Piloting one ship would be difficult enough, but two
VALDORE: Then you'll have to increase the stimulants.
NIJIL: The dosage is already at a dangerous level. He could be
permanently damaged. He could die.
VALDORE: If I didn't know you better, I would say you're more concerned
with this creature's well-being than you are with this mission.
NIJIL: Without the pilot, there would be no mission.
VALDORE: Just keep him alive long enough to destroy the Earth ship.
After that, his health is of little consequence.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: Come in.
SHRAN: I just received a transmission. Our scientists identified the
brain wave pattern.
ARCHER: And?
SHRAN: It's from my world, but it's not from any Andorian you'd know.
It's Aenar. They're a kind of subspecies. Blind ice-dwellers. For most
of our history, they were considered a myth, stories we told our
children, but fifty years ago, they were discovered living in the
Northern Wastes. They're extremely secretive. I can count on one hand
the number of Andorians who've seen one face-to-face.
ARCHER: Could they have built a ship like the marauder?
SHRAN: I seriously doubt they have the capacity. There are only a few
thousand of them left, and even if they could, they're pacifists. They
don't believe in violence.
ARCHER: One of them does.
SHRAN: It seems that way.
ARCHER: We need to find out who's controlling that ship.
SHRAN: Agreed.
ARCHER: (into comm.) Travis.
TRAVIS [OC]: Yes, sir?
ARCHER: Set a course for Andoria, maximum warp.
[Sickbay]
(The place is almost filled with strange equipment
and thick rubber tubing.)
T'POL: You should rest.
TUCKER: I just need a second.
T'POL: Phlox thinks it's too soon for you to return to duty.
TUCKER: Phlox? You were talking to him about me?
T'POL: It came up in conversation.
TUCKER: Right. Well, I don't have the option of taking a break. The
Captain needs this done fast.
(T'Pol is working on modifying a biobed.)
T'POL:
I can manage.
TUCKER: You might be the best there is at crunching numbers, but when
it comes to actually sticking things together, you're a little out of
your league. These work better when you strip off the duranite caps.
Don't ask me why, they just do.
T'POL: I'll make a note of that.
TUCKER: You know, when I was on that ship with Malcolm I was convinced
I was going to die. You ever been there?
T'POL: Since Enterprise was launched, we've all been near death on more
than one occasion.
TUCKER: I'm not talking close scrapes. I mean when you're in a bad
situation, and you know this is it, there's no way out, and you have
time to think about it.
T'POL: In the Expanse, when we were attempting to destroy Sphere forty
one, I didn't believe we'd survive.
TUCKER: What went through your mind?
T'POL: Whether or not to transfer auxiliary power to the deflector
array. Why do you ask?
TUCKER: Just curious.
{Corridor/Transporter alcove]
(Enterprise has arrived at a blue planet with a
ring system and at least two fair-sized moons.)
REED: The Aenar compound is surrounded by a dampening field. Once
you're inside, you won't be able to contact the ship. I'd feel much
better about this if you'd take a couple of MACOs with you.
SHRAN: We go in there with a show of force, we won't get a thing out of
them.
ARCHER: We're going alone.
REED: Captain, we don't know anything about these people.
ARCHER: That's why we're here. Energise.
[Andoria]
(Which is not the ringed planet, as that is in the
sky. Shran and Archer materialise in a place of deep snow which has
been cut into walls and doorways.)
SHRAN: Taste that air. Really gets the blood running.
(Archer puts up the hood on his parka then looking at Shran's scanner.)
ARCHER:
Twenty eight below?
SHRAN: Lucky for you, it's the middle of summer.
ARCHER: Yeah.
SHRAN: The entrance is twenty metres ahead. The Vulcans say the desert
teaches men the meaning of endurance. But it's the ice that forges real
strength.
ARCHER: It's hard to believe anything can survive here.
SHRAN: It isn't easy. Andorian cities are built underground to take
advantage of geothermal energy. I didn't see the sun till I was
fifteen.
(They wend their way through ice walls, and Shran wobbles then falls to
his knees.)
ARCHER: Careful, Shran. You don't have your balance back yet.
SHRAN: Hands off, pinkskin. These tunnels branch out for thousands of
kilometres. Not a good place to get lost.
[Control area]
NIJIL: We'll be ready to launch in twelve hours.
VALDORE: And the pilot?
NIJIL: He's resting.
VALDORE: Will he be ready?
NIJIL: I'll make sure that he is.
VALDORE: Spoken like a soldier.
NIJIL: I'm a scientist.
VALDORE: We're all soldiers, Nijil, from the moment we're born. When we
forget that we invite disaster. You know I was once a senator?
NIJIL: No.
VALDORE: Many years ago. Vrax and I were colleagues. I even considered
him a friend.
NIJIL: What happened?
VALDORE: I made the mistake of challenging the precept of unlimited
expansion. I asked the question. Is conquest truly the best course for
our people? And I was expelled.
NIJIL: I'm sorry.
VALDORE: I'm not trying to evoke your pity. I want you to learn from my
experience. When I was led away from the Senate chamber, I vowed never
to repeat my error and never to forget my purpose.
NIJIL: I understand.
VALDORE: Continue with your preparations.
[Ice tunnels]
{Shran spots a lot of bright holes in an arch over
their path.)
SHRAN: Ice-bores. Worms. They live in the ice. Generate heat through a
chemical reaction. Big swarm came through here a day or two ago.
ARCHER: I'm sure Phlox would love to get his hands on one.
SHRAN: Best to avoid them. When I was a boy, I stumbled into a large
den, wound up with third-degree burns over half my body.
(He sways as they stand at the top of a cliff.)
ARCHER: Shran, listen to me. We should find another way.
SHRAN: Afraid of heights, Captain?
(He heads down a series of steps cut conveniently in the ice, then
suddenly falls the rest of the way, and lands screaming in pain with a
bright blue icicle stuck through his right leg. Archer dashes
down to him.)
ARCHER: Shran!
SHRAN: The ice gave out beneath me.
(He lifts his own leg off the icicle.)
ARCHER: You're losing a lot of blood. Hold still.
(We see someone is watching as Archer tends Shran's wound.)
ARCHER: Hold still. Bleeding's stopped, but if you move it could start
again.
SHRAN: We can't stay here. We'll freeze to death.
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise. Archer to Enterprise.
SHRAN: We're well inside the dampening field.
ARCHER: It doesn't hurt to try. How far are we from the Aenar? (Shran
spots the watcher.)
SHRAN:
I think we just got a lot closer.
(Several more of the pale-skinned, pale-dressed people appear.)
ARCHER: Hello. We need your help. My friend's been hurt.
LISSAN: (a woman) We'll assist you.
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: There's not as much data on the neural
interface as I'd like.
T'POL: It's all we have.
PHLOX: I can connect someone to the unit, but it'll be dangerous.
TUCKER: How dangerous?
PHLOX: If the interface malfunctions, there could be severe neurolytic
shock, possibly resulting in brain damage.
TUCKER: There's got to be some way we can make it safer.
PHLOX: Diagnostics will only tell us so much, I'm afraid.
T'POL: When can we test it?
PHLOX: A day.
TUCKER: I want to be the first one to try it out.
T'POL: You're not telepathic. It wouldn't be a true measure of the
unit's effectiveness.
TUCKER: Well, at least we'll find out if it causes brain damage.
T'POL: I'll test the unit.
TUCKER: You're the ranking officer. Too risky.
T'POL: Considering what's at stake, the risk is acceptable.
TUCKER: We could at least wait until the Captain gets back.
T'POL: Our goal should be to have the unit ready by the time he
returns. That means conducting a full series of tests. The discussion's
closed. We have a lot of work to do.
[Aenar city]
(Under the ice is a beautiful city of elegant
curved buildings rising up in a massive cavern. In a room with ice
furniture, Shran is being tended on a bed covered with fur when the
woman walks in.)
LISSAN: Your wound is healing well. You'll be able to walk on your own
in a few hours.
SHRAN: My thanks.
(The Aenar doctor leaves.)
LISSAN: You're Captain Archer.
ARCHER: You can read minds.
LISSAN: We have a strict law here, Captain. No one may enter another's
thoughts without permission. I know your name because the Andorian
Chancellor contacted us.
ARCHER: I need to speak with someone in authority.
LISSAN: We assign our leaders as the need arises. For this occasion, I
have been chosen as Speaker.
ARCHER: I take it you know why we're here.
LISSAN: I know what the Andorians have told us. Someone's been
attacking your ships, and you believe we're involved.
ARCHER: It's a bit more complicated than that.
LISSAN: It will save time and foster our trust, if I can have your
thoughts.
(Shran shakes his head.)
ARCHER: Go ahead.
LISSAN: You have an interesting mind, Captain. Many facets.
ARCHER: Thank you.
LISSAN: Some of those facets are in conflict.
SHRAN: That explains a lot.
ARCHER: Shran.
LISSAN: The evidence you've gathered appears irrefutable. It seems
there was an Aenar controlling that ship.
ARCHER: But you're sceptical.
LISSAN: We're a nonviolent people. That a member of our race could
cause so much death, it's extremely disturbing.
ARCHER: Do you have any idea who it could be?
LISSAN: There's one possibility.
SHRAN: Who?
LISSAN: A year ago, one of our citizens disappeared while collecting
ice-bores. We assumed he'd been killed in an accident, but we never
found his body.
SHRAN: Now you know why.
LISSAN: Gareb would not be doing this voluntarily.
ARCHER: You think he was abducted?
LISSAN: It's the best explanation.
SHRAN: It doesn't matter why he's doing it. He has to be stopped.
LISSAN: This device that you're building aboard your ship.
ARCHER: We're hoping it will disrupt the signal that's controlling the
marauder.
LISSAN: You will need one of us to operate it.
SHRAN: You owe us that much, at least.
LISSAN: I'll consult with the others.
[Mess hall]
TUCKER: Coffee, strong.
[Corridor]
(Walking back with his mug.)
T'POL: Commander.
TUCKER: Hey.
(He keeps walking.)
T'POL: Trip. I appreciate your concern for my safety.
TUCKER: I just don't want Enterprise to lose a good officer.
T'POL: I think you're letting your feelings impact your work.
TUCKER: My work's as good as it's ever been. As far as my feelings go,
they're purely professional.
[Aenar city]
SHRAN: I've never been able to sleep with someone
standing at the foot of my bed.
JHAMEL: (a younger girl) I didn't mean to disturb you.
SHRAN: Actually, I was awake. What is it?
JHAMEL: I've never met a blueskin.
SHRAN: You're blind. How can you tell my skin is blue?
JHAMEL: Don't ask me to explain. I was never very good at science.
SHRAN; Neither was I.
JHAMEL: Is it true that where you come from, the temperature rises
above freezing for weeks at a time?
SHRAN: Every few years, there's a heat wave. I've been on worlds where
the temperature is only slightly below the boiling point of water.
JHAMEL: I can't imagine such a place.
SHRAN: I'm trying to forget it. I lost ten percent of my body weight in
two days.
JHAMEL: I came here to apologise.
SHRAN: For what?
JHAMEL: When I saw you for the first time, I sensed some of your
thoughts. I didn't intend to.
SHRAN: It's never been all that hard to figure out what I'm thinking.
JHAMEL: I know what it's like to lose someone. Gareb, the one who's
missing, he's my brother.
SHRAN: I'm sorry.
JHAMEL: He would never hurt anyone, not intentionally.
SHRAN: So we've been told.
JHAMEL: Do you think he's in pain?
SHRAN: There's no way of knowing.
JHAMEL: I have nightmares. Gareb's bound, locked in a strange cage.
He's calling for me. He wants me to rescue him.
[Control area]
(Gareb is lead back in and put into the pilot's
chair.)
NIJIL: Forgive me.
(Nijil gives Gareb an injection.)
[Sickbay]
(T'Pol is in Enterprise's equivalent of Gareb's
chair, also with a helmet over her head, when Phlox switches it on.)
PHLOX: How do you feel?
T'POL: I just need a moment.
TUCKER: Whenever you're ready. Indicator's moving. Doc?
PHLOX: So far, so good.
TUCKER: I'll be damned. It's working.
(T'Pol tenses and whimpers.)
TUCKER: She okay?
PHLOX: Her synaptic response is erratic.
T'POL: I'll be fine.
PHLOX: It's getting worse, Commander.
TUCKER: That's enough. Shut it down!
(He takes the helmet off her.)
PHLOX: You're all right.
TUCKER: It worked.
T'POL: I'll rest for a few minutes, and then we'll try again.
[Aenar city]
ARCHER: You said Gareb was abducted. If that's
true, don't you want to help him?
LISSAN: Not with violence.
ARCHER: We're trying to stop violence.
LISSAN: I won't deny that your intentions are honourable, but our
decision stands.
SHRAN: Forget it, Captain. They've never even helped defend their own
world. We're wasting our time.
[Control area]
NIJIL: Systems ready.
VALDORE: Launch the Drones.
(Two ships dash off to warp.)
[Andoria, ice tunnels]
JHAMEL: You need to rest.
SHRAN: I've had enough rest.
ARCHER: We should clear the dampening field soon.
JHAMEL: Wait
SHRAN: What is it?
JHAMEL: A swarm.
SHRAN: I don't see anything.
(Then worms drop out of the ceiling in front of them and burrow into
the floor.)
JHAMEL: It'll take a few minutes for them to pass. Gareb and I loved
chasing ice-bores. Once, we followed a swarm for two hours, caught
hundreds of them. We were almost at the surface. My family was very
worried. They're going to be worried about me now.
SHRAN: Are you sure you want to do this?
JHAMEL: I won't abandon my brother. What's it like, your ship?
ARCHER: Warm.
[Sickbay]
(Tucker whispers to Phlox, supposedly out of
earshot of T'Pol.)
TUCKER: She wants to try again. You think it's smart?
PHLOX: You know the risks. So does Commander T'Pol. Commander, she's
doing her job.
TUCKER: She's going to hurt herself.
PHLOX: Take my advice. Don't interfere.
TUCKER: I can't believe I'm getting this from you now. Has everyone on
this ship gone crazy?
PHLOX: Not everyone.
TUCKER: Oh, I'm crazy?
PHLOX: It's not your fault. As far as I know, there are no species in
the galaxy that have mastered the art of mixing romance and vocation.
TUCKER: You're the last one that should be giving me a lecture. Vulcan
neuro-pressure was your idea.
PHLOX: You were having trouble sleeping.
TUCKER: What the hell am I going to do?
PHLOX: This is the one ailment that is universally untreatable. You'll
have to suffer through it.
[Andoria, ice tunnels]
(There's a familiar lot of holes in the ceiling and
floor.)
ARCHER: We've been here before.
JHAMEL: He's right, we're going in circles. They're trying to stop us.
ARCHER: How?
JHAMEL: They're not letting us see the path to the surface.
SHRAN; How could that be possible?
(An image of Lissan flickers on the path in front of them.)
LISSAN: It's time to come back.
JHAMEL: I can't.
LISSAN; They're fighting a war. Do you want to be a part of that?
JHAMEL: I don't want to fight anyone. I want to help my brother.
LISSAN; Help him by standing up for what we believe in.
ARCHER: She's doing what she thinks is right.
LISSAN: She's betraying her people.
ARCHER: That's not true. Shouldn't she be allowed to follow her own
conscience?
LISSAN; She's not following her conscience.
ARCHER: How do you know? Have you read her mind? I thought that was
against your custom.
LISSAN: Jhamel.
JHAMEL: Take my thoughts.
LISSAN; You're certain this is what you want?
JHAMEL: Yes.
LISSAN: Very well.
(Her image vanishes and they see that they are at the surface, with the
ringed planet hanging in the sky.)
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've returned to
Enterprise, where we received word that the cargo ship Ticonderoga is
missing.
[Corridor]
ARCHER: Anything on long range sensors?
T'POL: Not yet.
ARCHER: What's our ETA?
T'POL: We'll be at their last known co-ordinates in six hours.
ARCHER: Tell Malcolm to finish his upgrades to the targeting scanners.
If we run into that marauder again, I want to make sure every shot
counts.
T'POL: Understood.
(She leaves him and he walks straight into -)
[Sickbay]
ARCHER: Report?
TUCKER: She's good to go.
(Jhamel is seated on the modified biobed.)
ARCHER: Whenever you're ready.
JHAMEL: I'm ready, Captain.
(The helmet is lowered over her head. Tucker reads
the monitor.)
TUCKER: A lot of movement. Fifty percent spike.
ARCHER; Are you feeling all right?
SHRAN: We can stop anytime you like.
JHAMEL: It's strangely enjoyable.
TUCKER: She's maxed it out.
JHAMEL: Is that good?
ARCHER: Very good.
JHAMEL: Is there another test we can try?
TUCKER: We could simulate a course correction.
(The biobed sways from side to side, then she gasps.)
PHLOX: Synaptic trouble.
SHRAN: Shut it down!
(They get the helmet off her and Phlox gives her an injection.)
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. We've arrived at
the last known co-ordinates of the Ticonderoga.
[Bridge]
T'POL: I'm picking up debris. Hull fragments.
Nacelle casings. Several bodies, human.
ARCHER: Keep scanning. Try to find the marauder's warp signature.
T'POL: Is there any word from Sickbay?
ARCHER: She's going to be okay, but Phlox says it's too dangerous to
try again. Looks like we went all the way to Andoria for nothing.
[Sickbay]
JHAMEL: What happened?
SHRAN: You had a convulsion. You're all right now.
JHAMEL: I was dreaming about Gareb. I failed, didn't I?
SHRAN: Ridiculous. That kind of bravery is never a failure. I'm a
commander in the Imperial Guard. I'd be afraid to go anywhere near that
thing.
JHAMEL: Talas was a fortunate woman.
SHRAN: I was the fortunate one.
JHAMEL: My brother is going to die, isn't he?
SHRAN: I won't hear that from you.
JHAMEL: It's hard to be strong.
SHRAN: You make it look easy. Keep being strong. For me.
[Bridge]
T'POL: A ship's dropping out of warp. It appears to
be a Tellarite freighter.
ARCHER: Tactical Alert. Hail them. Target their engines.
T'POL: If it is a freighter.
ARCHER: Anything?
(Hoshi shakes her head.)
TRAVIS: One hundred kilometres.
ARCHER: Fire.
(The freighter loses its holographic skin and reverts to its proper
appearance - a Drone, which attacks.)
ARCHER; Aim for their weapons.
REED; They're too damned fast. I can't get a target lock.
[Sickbay]
JHAMEL: What's happening?
SHRAN: We're under attack. I'm going to the Bridge.
JHAMEL: Wait. I can feel him.
(She gets up.)
PHLOX; Where do you think you're going?
JHAMEL: Connect me to the device, I need to try again.
PHLOX; I can't allow it. You barely survived the last attempt.
JHAMEL: I can reach him. I can make him stop.
SHRAN: Let her try.
[Control area]
NIJIL: Enterprise is taking heavy damage.
VALDORE: Target with the second Drone. Attack vector one seven seven.
NIJIL: It may not be necessary.
VALDORE: Follow my orders.
NIJIL: Yes, Admiral.
[Bridge]
REED: Another ship's approaching, bearing oh one
six mark twelve. An Andorian battle cruiser.
ARCHER: T'Pol?
T'POL: It's power signature is not Andorian.
ARCHER: Target them!
T'POL: Captain, I'm picking up an energy reading from Sickbay. It's the
telepresence unit.
ARCHER: Archer to Sickbay. What's going on?
[Sickbay]
PHLOX; Jhamel's going to make another attempt.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Is she up to it?
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: She's quite insistent.
(The second Drone reveals its true appearance.)
PHLOX: Cortical fluctuation. It could trigger a seizure.
SHRAN: Jhamel.
JHAMEL: I can do it.
PHLOX: Disconnect her. Now!
JHAMEL: No!
SHRAN: She can do this.
[Control area]
NIJIL: They've lost warp power.
VALDORE: Continue targeting their engines.
NIJIL: Someone's tapping into the telemetric array.
[Telepathic conversation]
GAREB: Jhamel?
JHAMEL: It's me.
GAREB: It's not possible. How?
JHAMEL: You have to stop what you're doing.
GAREB: Where are you?
JHAMEL: I'm on the ship you're attacking.
[Control area]
VALDORE: Both Drones are coming to a stop. We're
defenceless.
[Bridge]
REED: They've stopped firing.
[Telepathic conversation]
GAREB: I thought you were dead. They said I was the
last surviving Aenar.
JHAMEL: They lied to you.
GAREB: I've killed so many people.
JHAMEL: It wasn't you. It was them, they forced you. You can stop it.
You know what you have to do.
[Control area]
NIJIL: The first Drone is targeting the second.
VALDORE: Take all weapons offline.
NIJIL: I've lost access.
[Bridge]
REED: They're attacking each other.
ARCHER: Let's give them a hand. Photonic torpedoes, full spread.
REED: Aye, sir.
[Control area]
VALDORE: (grabbing Gareb) Stop this! Now.
NIJIL: No!
VALDORE: Resume your attack on the Earth ship.
[Telepathic conversation]
GAREB: Remember me, Jhamel.
JHAMEL: Gareb!
(As one Drone blows the other to pieces, Valdore kills Gareb. Shran and
Phlox get Jhamel out of the telepresence device and Reed blows up the
other Drone. Shran comforts Jhamel.)
 [Transporter alcove]
ARCHER: I want to thank you again.
JHAMEL: I owe you a thanks. If I hadn't come with you, my brother would
have died alone. Goodbye, Captain.
ARCHER: Goodbye.
SHRAN: I regret much of what happened between us recently.
ARCHER: Same here.
SHRAN: When you lose your ship, you aren't usually rewarded with
another one. I may not see you for a while.
T'POL: If there's anything we can do or say on your behalf.
SHRAN: I appreciate the offer. Let's just see what the future brings.
Try to stay out of trouble, pinkskin.
[Deleted Scene - Control area]
 Valdore is sitting in the Drone helm seat
when Vrax and two Reman enter.)
VALDORE: Senator, I assume I'm under arrest.
VRAX: We're both under arrest.
VALDORE: So it seems I'll be serving with you again. Nijil, goodbye.
NIJIL: The failure is mine, not yours.
VALDORE: Spoken like a soldier.
(Vrax and Valdore are taken away.) 
 Captain's Starlog, supplemental. There's been no
sign of any other marauder ships. We're returning Shran and Jhamel to
Andoria.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: Come in.
(Tucker enters.)
ARCHER: I've been looking over your report. I think you're being a
little hard on yourself.
TUCKER: There's no getting around it. I missed a ten degree variance in
the telepresence emitter.
ARCHER: I spoke with Phlox. He doesn't think it had anything to do with
Jhamel's seizure.
TUCKER: But he can't be sure. Either way, I should have caught it.
ARCHER: We were all under a lot of pressure.
TUCKER: My mind wasn't on the job.
ARCHER: If that were true, we probably wouldn't be standing here now.
TUCKER: Captain, I want a transfer.
ARCHER: Where?
TUCKER: Columbia. They need experienced people.
ARCHER: You turned them down twice before. Why now?
TUCKER: I think I can do some good over there.
ARCHER: I need you here, Trip.
TUCKER: They need me more.
ARCHER: What's this really about?
TUCKER: I told you.
ARCHER: I haven't heard one thing that explains this.
TUCKER: I've said everything I want to.
ARCHER: That's it? I'm supposed to accept that? And if I refuse your
transfer?
TUCKER: Captain, as a friend, I'm asking you let me do this.
ARCHER: It's your career, Trip. But as a friend, I'm asking you to
stay.
TUCKER: I can't.
ARCHER: All right.
TUCKER: Thank you.
ARCHER: Dismissed.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Affliction
Affliction
 Mission date: Nov 27, 2154
Original Airdate: 18 Feb, 2005
  [Laboratory]
 (A targ steals a steak from a table, some men are
seated at the other end of the room. The door opens and two men bring
another in. He is not happy. The dialogue is translated from the spoken
Klingon.)
KLINGON: What do you want with me?
K'VAGH: Secure him.
(He is fastened into a chair.)
KLINGON: I demand to see the magistrate.
(His captors set up a blood transfusion - it's green - and stick the
needle into his arm.)
KLINGON: My death sentence was commuted!
(His breathing becomes laboured, then he cries out in pain as his
forehead ridges ripple.)
Captain's Starlog, November 27, 2154. We've
returned home for the official launch of our sister ship, Columbia. On
a personal note, I'll also be saying goodbye to one hell of a chief
Engineer.
[Trip's quarters]
(Tucker takes a break from packing to gaze at
Columbia in Spacedock, when the doorbell rings.)
TUCKER: Yeah? (T'Pol enters.) TUCKER: She's a thing of beauty.
T'POL: Columbia's virtually identical to Enterprise.
TUCKER: A good engineer can see the differences. You coming to the mess
hall later? My going away party?
T'POL: I don't understand the logic behind this transfer. You're not
being promoted
TUCKER: You think I'm doing this to advance my career?
T'POL: You wouldn't leave Captain Archer without sufficient reason.
TUCKER: Well, for one thing, this is a new challenge. It took me a year
to fine-tune Enterprise. I figure I can do the same for Captain
Hernandez in half the time. She needs a Chief Engineer who's been out
there, has the experience.
T'POL: Are you leaving because of me?
TUCKER: Look, Starfleet's approved the transfer.
T'POL: You didn't answer my question.
TUCKER: This may come as a shock, but not everything in my life
revolves around you.
[San Francisco - Street]
(Hoshi and Phlox are leaving a Chinese restaurant.)
HOSHI: I'm glad we got here early.
PHLOX: There never used to be a wait to get in.
HOSHI: You didn't think Madame Chang's was going to be your little
secret forever, did you?
PHLOX: There are a lot of Starfleet people here.
HOSHI: That's probably my fault. I told a few friends about the place.
PHLOX: A few?
HOSHI: I'm a comm. officer. If there's one thing that I know how to do,
it's disseminate information. You didn't tell me how your meeting went
today at the IME.
PHLOX: They asked if I was interested in becoming Director of
Xenobiology.
HOSHI: That's great. Are you going to accept?
PHLOX: I'm considering it. The truth is, I've grown rather fond of my
shipmates. I'm not certain I'm ready to leave them just yet. What would
you suggest?
HOSHI: I'm the wrong person to ask. I've got a vested interest in
keeping you around.
(Three men step out of the bushes and block their way.)
THUG: You, Denobulan. Come with us.
PHLOX: What do you want?
THUG: Maybe you didn't hear me.
(He draws a gun, so Hoshi launches into martial arts mode. Four
struggle with each other. She bests one, but the other knocks her down.
Then Phlox gets stunned by the third and they drag him away while
half-conscious Hoshi watches and listens.)
THUG: Dol'sha t'ung nev'Rleel.
[San Francisco - Street - later]
(Scene of Crime officers are going over the place
with scanners as Archer arrives.)
ARCHER: Hoshi.
HOSHI: I'm all right, sir.
REED: Who did this?
COLLINS: (a woman, if it matters) That's what I'm trying to determine.
Commander Collins, Starfleet Security.
ARCHER: Jonathan Archer. This is Lieutenant Reed.
HOSHI: There were three men. They were in the shadows. I didn't get a
good look at them.
COLLINS: You told me before that one of them said something to the
others.
HOSHI: Right before I passed out. I'm pretty sure it wasn't English.
ARCHER: Do you remember what he said?
HOSHI: I'm sorry, sir.
COLLINS: The only DNA we've recovered belongs to Ensign Sato and to
your Doctor. We did find some residual ionisation traces here.
REED: A transporter signature?
COLLINS: Very few people have access to that kind of technology.
REED: Still, it's a likely explanation.
COLLINS: Doctor Phlox was involved in an altercation the last time he
was in San Francisco.
ARCHER: You think this is related?
COLLINS: Assaults against aliens are still pretty rare. If the man who
attacked him was holding a grudge
REED: He was a loudmouth in a bar. I doubt he could find his head with
both hands, never mind organise a kidnapping.
COLLINS: We're pursuing all avenues. Excuse me, Captain. Lieutenant.
(She leaves the group)
ARCHER: Check with Starfleet Operations. See if their satellites picked
up any transporter activity this evening.
[Colombia Engineering]
(Tucker has a pile of PADDs, and a group of attentive
assistant Engineers.)
TUCKER: The dilithium matrix has got to be aligned within point three
microns.
RIVERS: The specs say point five.
TUCKER: Who do you think wrote those specs?
RIVERS: A warp field specialist?
TUCKER: Exactly. Some guy who's probably never been outside the solar
system. I've spent the last three and a half years crawling inside one
of these engines. I know what I'm talking about.
RIVERS: Aye, sir.
TUCKER: Biggs, Pierce. (to a man and a petite woman) I want you to
recalibrate the field stabilisers. Rivers and Strong, start with the
injector assembly. This bucket of bolts was supposed to leave dry dock
six months ago. I guarantee you, Columbia's going to warp out of orbit
before the end of the week. Let's get to work. (Erika catches the end of that speech.)
ERIKA: It's customary to report to
the Captain after a transfer.
TUCKER: I'm sorry, ma'am. I wanted to see what the situation was like
before we spoke. Commander Charles Tucker, reporting for duty.
ERIKA: Welcome aboard. (They shake.) ERIKA: Trip, is it?
TUCKER: That's right.
ERIKA: So what do you think? Can she be salvaged?
TUCKER: I think there's a good chance. Any news on Doctor Phlox?
ERIKA: Not so far. If I hear anything, I'll let you know. You certainly
know how to motivate the troops.
TUCKER: We'll be pulling triple shifts if we want to meet this new
launch date.
ERIKA: You still need to eat. Captain's mess, tomorrow. Eighteen
hundred hours. We can trade stories about your former CO.
TUCKER: I'll be there.
ERIKA: Commander, drop by the quartermaster's at the end of your shift.
TUCKER: Ma'am?
ERIKA: Might want to update your uniform. (She indicates the arm patch with
ship's name on it.)
TUCKER: Aye, Captain.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: Come in. (T'Pol enters.) ARCHER: We've heard nothing
from the kidnappers. Not even a ransom demand.
T'POL: I've spoken with the Denobulan ambassador. He's notified the
doctor's wives.
ARCHER: Hoshi thought she overheard one of the kidnappers say something
in another language, but she was semi-conscious at the time. Maybe you
could help her remember.
T'POL: A mind-meld? I've never initiated a meld before. I don't have
the proper training.
ARCHER: I know it's dangerous, but I can walk you through it.
T'POL: You?
ARCHER: I had Surak's katra in my head for four days. I picked up a few
tricks.
[Armoury]
REED: Computer, access satellite logs one three
seven. Time parameters nineteen hundred and nineteen forty five today.
(The screen says grid 137 was offline for maintenance.)
REED: What? Starfleet Operations, this is Lieutenant Malcolm Reed
aboard Enterprise. Please acknowledge.
HARRIS [on monitor]: (he's not in SF uniform, but a black leather
number) Burning the midnight oil, Lieutenant?
REED: Sir? I thought I was calling Starfleet Ops.
HARRIS [on monitor]: Let me guess. You want to know why the grid
covering San Francisco was down for maintenance tonight.
REED: Something like that.
HARRIS [on monitor]: Meet me at this address in one hour.
(Incoming message - 1044 North Maple, San Francisco, California, USA,
Earth. 94-1104-314159)
[Hoshi's quarters]
T'POL: My mind to your mind. Our minds are merging.
Our minds are one.
HOSHI: Nothing's happening.
ARCHER: T'Pol, try to relax your emotional suppression just a little.
T'POL: I feel what you feel. I know what you know. (telepathically) Can
you hear me?
HOSHI: (telepathically) Yes, perfectly.
T'POL: You and the doctor have just left the restaurant.
HOSHI: (memory) I'm glad we got here early.
PHLOX: (memory) There never used to be a wait to get in.
T'POL: Good.
[Hoshi's memory]
(This time, T'Pol walks with them down the street.)
PHLOX: They asked if I was interested in becoming Director of
Xenobiology.
T'POL: Where were you attacked?
HOSHI: There.
PHLOX: Truth is, I've grown rather fond of my shipmates
HOSHI: Do you see them?
PHLOX: just yet. What would you suggest?
(The attackers come out of the bushes.)
T'POL: Yes.
THUG: You, Denobulan. Come with us.
PHLOX: What do you want?
THUG: Maybe you didn't hear me.
(T'Pol watches the fight.)
T'POL: (to the fallen Hoshi) Focus on the moment. Put aside any pain.
THUG: Dol'sha t'ung nev'Rleel.
[Hoshi's quarters]
T'POL: Dol'sha t'ung nev'Rleel.
BOTH: Dol'sha t'ung nev'Rleel. (Hoshi openes her eyes, the meld finished.)
HOSHI: Bring him with us. It's
Rigelian.
[Situation room]
T'POL: A Rigelian freighter left orbit two hours
after Phlox's abduction. According to their flight plan, they were
headed for Proxima Colony.
ARCHER: This trajectory won't take them anywhere near Proxima Colony.
Ensign.
ENSIGN: Sir.
ARCHER: Put Admiral Gardner through to my Ready room. Shore leaves are
cancelled. Get everyone back on board.
[North Maple]
(Reed meets Harris as a slight mist drifts in.)
REED: Am I to understand you are responsible for taking that satellite
grid offline?
HARRIS: Not me personally.
REED: But you're involved. Phlox is my friend. Do you know where he is?
HARRIS: We have an assignment for you.
REED: I wasn't aware that I was still a part of your section.
HARRIS: There's a job that needs doing, Lieutenant, and it may be the
only way to save your friend's life.
[Laboratory]
(Phlox is brought in by two Klingons.)
K'VAGH: Welcome to Qu'Vat Colony, Doctor. You will work with Doctor
Antaak.
PHLOX: I will do nothing of the kind.
K'VAGH: Then you will die.
PHLOX: I'm certain there are easier ways for you to recruit a new lab
assistant.
K'VAGH: You misunderstand me, Doctor. Antaak will be assisting you.
ANTAAK: It's good to see you again, Doctor.
PHLOX: I beg your pardon?
ANTAAK: I wouldn't expect you to remember but we met briefly five years
ago, at the IME conference on Tiburon.
PHLOX: I don't recall meeting a Klingon at that conference.
ANTAAK: I was disguised as a member of the Mazarite delegation. My
people weren't invited.
K'VAGH: I will let you two get reacquainted. I suggest you work
quickly, Doctor. I expect a progress report by sunrise.
(He leaves with one guard, leaving the other by the door.)
ANTAAK: You must forgive the General's conduct. The Warrior caste has
little use for social protocols.
PHLOX: What do you want with me?
ANTAAK: The Empire is facing its gravest threat since the Hur'q
invasion. A virus is spreading from planet to planet. Millions are
already infected. If this continues, the Klingon species will cease to
exist.
PHLOX: Why didn't you simply ask for our help? Starfleet and Denobula
would've provided you with all of the specialists you'd need.
ANTAAK: You don't understand the Klingon way, Doctor. To ask for
assistance would make us look weak in the eyes of our enemies. It could
even incite rebellion.
PHLOX: Why me?
ANTAAK: I was impressed by your lecture at the conference. Your paper
on viral propagation was very insightful.
PHLOX: What field of study are you in, precisely?
ANTAAK: Metagenic research. I've already isolated the virus. I assume
you'll want to start by mapping the nucleotides? It wasn't my idea to
abduct you. Nevertheless, you are here. Millions of lives are at risk.
[Bridge]
T'POL: The freighter's warp trail has terminated.
REED: They may have dropped to impulse.
ARCHER: How long to intercept?
TRAVIS: At our current speed, eight point two hours.
ARCHER: Archer to Engineering. Commander Kelby, respond.
[Engineering]
KELBY: Kelby here, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: We could use a little more speed.
KELBY: The injectors are running at a hundred and five percent.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Commander Tucker's pushed them higher than
that before.
KELBY [OC]: I'll see what I can do, Captain.
[Colombia Captain's mess]
TUCKER: I don't know who's in charge of your Mess
Hall, but he could give the chef on Enterprise a run for his money.
ERIKA: I stole him from the Republic. Captain Jennings said I could
have anything I wanted when I left, so I took his cook. I've gotten two
transfer requests from crewmen in your department.
TUCKER: Who?
ERIKA: It's probably better if I didn't mention names. I denied them.
You're already short-handed. Quite an impression you've made,
Commander. You've been aboard
less than two days and already some of your team want to jump ship.
TUCKER: I've knocked a few heads together, but we're getting the job
done. We'll be ready for warp trials by Thursday.
ERIKA: I was surprised you accepted this transfer. I saw an interview
with you after the Xindi mission. You said you couldn't see yourself
serving on any other starship.
TUCKER: Well, you've got a good memory, Captain.
ERIKA: It comes in handy.
TUCKER: I was getting a little too comfortable on Enterprise. Got a lot
of friends over there, but sometimes it's easier to work with people
who are just colleagues.
[T'Pol's meditation]
(It is a white space, where T'Pol is sitting
cross-legged when Tucker wanders over. She stands up.)
T'POL: Why are you here?
TUCKER: I was about to ask you the same thing. Is this a daydream?
T'POL: I'm meditating. This is where I go in my mind.
TUCKER: Well, I would've thought you'd pick a more interesting place.
Like the beach, or one of those Fire Plains you showed me.
T'POL: Please leave.
TUCKER: Exactly where am I supposed to go?
T'POL: Away.
TUCKER: This is my daydream. You go away.
[Colombia Engineering]
RIVERS: Excuse me, Commander? Is everything all
right?
TUCKER: Yeah, I'm fine.
RIVERS: The diagnostic you asked for.
TUCKER: Thanks.
[T'Pol's quarters]
(She opens her eyes, clearly not happy with her
meditation.)
ARCHER [OC]: Bridge to T'Pol. We're approaching the coordinates.
T'POL: On my way.
[Bridge]
(The mangled remains of the Rigelian ship are on
the viewscreen.)
T'POL: No biosigns. I'm reading several bodies aboard.
ARCHER: Is one of them Denobulan?
T'POL: They're all Rigelian.
ARCHER: Can you tell who did this?
(Reed's console says weapons signature confirmed, and Hadron count 147,
but he switches it off.)
REED: No, sir. I'll have to bring aboard some of the debris and analyse
it.
ARCHER: Scan for their data recorder. It might tell us something.
[Laboratory]
PHLOX: Unless I'm mistaken, this virus is a mutated
form of the Levodian flu.
ANTAAK: It's immune to whatever antiviral we've tried.
PHLOX: We should contact the IME. They may have seen this mutation
before. I'm certain they'll be willing to share their database with us.
I know of a few indirect channels. No one would have to know.
ANTAAK: There's no reason to contact them. We've acquired their entire
database.
PHLOX: You stole it.
ANTAAK: Medical research isn't a priority for the High Council. I'm
forced to obtain information however I can.
PHLOX: That doesn't sound very honourable.
ANTAAK: Given the choice between honour and saving lives, I choose the
latter.
PHLOX: Perhaps you should ask your superiors to steal a genome
sequencer? We're not going to be able to map the virus without the
proper technology.
(K'Vagh and two soldiers bring in the prisoner from the Cantina, now
with an nearly flat forehead.)
PHLOX: This man's been infected.
K'VAGH: Very observant.
PHLOX: We're being exposed.
ANTAAK: This patient is at stage one. The virus doesn't become
contagious until stage three.
PHLOX: When I asked you to bring me a subject for dissection, I assumed
he'd already be dead.
K'VAGH: He won't be alive much longer.
PHLOX: (stopping Antaak) What do you think you're doing?
ANTAAK: Euthanising him.
PHLOX: Out of the question. I thought you were committed to saving
lives.
ANTAAK: It is more honourable to give one's life to medical research
than to die for no purpose!
PHLOX: That choice is not ours to make.
(K'Vagh shoots the prisoner himself.)
K'VAGH: Proceed.
[Reed's quarters]
REED: Computer, establish an encrypted comm.-link.
Starfleet frequency seven nine baker.
HARRIS [on monitor]: Lieutenant.
REED: You told me the Klingons were going to rendezvous with that
freighter, not destroy it.
HARRIS [on monitor]: I regret what happened. But, they had to cover
their tracks.
REED: How many were on board that ship?
HARRIS [on monitor]: That's not your concern. Have you analysed the
weapon signatures yet?
REED: Yes.
HARRIS [on monitor]: You haven't told Archer?
REED: I'm not certain how much longer I can keep this from him.
HARRIS [on monitor]: Orion raiders have been known to operate in this
area.
REED: You want me to lie again? I could explain the situation to the
Captain.
HARRIS [on monitor]: You have a peculiar sense of humour, Lieutenant.
REED: I've worked closely with the man. You can trust him.
HARRIS [on monitor]: Archer is a Starfleet captain. His duty would be
to report everything you tell him to Admiral Gardner. They would launch
an investigation.
REED: I'm being compromised, sir, and I don't like it.
HARRIS [on monitor]: Then I suggest you adjust your comfort level,
Lieutenant. You made a commitment to us long before you joined the
Enterprise.
(Enterprise is jolted by weapons fire.)
HOSHI [OC]: Tactical Alert. All hands to battle stations.
HARRIS [on monitor]: What was that?
REED: I believe we're under attack.
[Bridge]
(A Klingon ship is attacking them.)
T'POL: Hull plating's holding.
HOSHI: Still no response.
ARCHER: Target their weapons.
(In a corridor, a crewman gets shot then four aliens head up a
Jefferies tube.)
HOSHI: We've been boarded. D deck, starboard side. Access tube seven.
ARCHER: Seal it off. Get the MACOs down there.
[Corridor]
MARAB: (something in alien)
(One of his colleagues works at a panel.)
MARAB: (into communicator) Target weapons on this location.
(The ship does so, injuring the MACOs down the corridor.)
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Disable that ship. I don't want them
getting away.
[Corridor]
(They finish what they came to do.)
MARAB: Return to the transport site.
(A MACO manages to shoot one, and the other three leave him when
reinforcements arrive.)
[Bridge]
T'POL: They've activated their transporter.
TRAVIS: They're going to warp.
ARCHER: Pursuit course.
TRAVIS: The helm's not responding.
[Sickbay]
(The captured alien is strapped to a biobed.)
ARCHER: Wake him up.
(A female medic does so.)
ARCHER: Why did you attack us?
MARAB: SoHvaD pagh vIjatlh, human.
HOSHI: I have nothing to say to you, human.
ARCHER: That sounds like
HOSHI: Klingon.
T'POL: There must be some kind of mistake.
ARCHER: What is it?
T'POL: According to his bio-signature, he is Klingon.
(Archer stares at the smooth-foreheaded Klingon.)
[Situation room]
REED: He must have been surgically altered to look
human.
ARCHER: Any theories?
T'POL: I need to run further tests. Their boarding party disabled our
antimatter flow regulators. Warp drive should be repaired in six hours.
ARCHER: Give our new Chief Engineer a hand. Tell him to dig a little
deeper, see if these Klingons damaged any other systems.
(Travis leaves.)
ARCHER: The Rigelian freighter. Did you get anything out of the black
box?
T'POL: It's been erased.
REED: It might've been a safeguard, in case it fell into the wrong
hands.
ARCHER: Work with Hoshi. See if you can reconstruct any data.
[Laboratory]
PHLOX: There is something familiar about these
base-pair sequences.
ANTAAK: Familiar?
(There's a sound by Phlox's feet, and he looks down to see the targ
nuzzling at his shoes.)
ANTAAK: Boshar! Feeding time is over. Go back!
(The creature leaves.)
PHLOX: Do you think it's wise to keep wild animals in here?
ANTAAK: There are dozens of creatures in your Sickbay.
PHLOX: I don't let them roam free.
ANTAAK: I could never keep Boshar locked up. He was my first patient.
He tore his side open when I was a child. I stitched the wound myself.
PHLOX: I have seen these sequences before. Six months ago, to be
precise. This is Augment DNA. How did modified human genes find their
way into this virus?
K'VAGH: Is that really such a surprise, Doctor? It took only two human
Augments to commandeer a Bird of Prey and murder its entire crew. The
Empire could not allow an inferior species to gain an advantage on us.
Imagine, every Starfleet vessel manned with genetically engineered
humans.
PHLOX: Earth banned genetic engineering decades ago. The Augments who
attacked you were relics of another era.
K'VAGH: The Vulcans told that to the High Council. They weren't very
persuasive. We were simply responding to a threat.
PHLOX: You were trying to create Klingon Augments. But Soong's
experiments were all killed. Where did you get the genetic material?
ANTAAK: Several embryos were found in the wreckage of the Bird of Prey.
We used them to re-sequence a number of test subjects. There were some
unanticipated side effects.
PHLOX: Their cranial ridges started to dissolve. Augment DNA was more
aggressive than you realised.
ANTAAK: For a time it appeared we were quite successful. Our Augments
might have looked human, but they were Klingon. Stronger, more
intelligent. Then, their neural pathways started to degrade. They died
in agony.
One of the test subjects was suffering from the Levodian flu. The
Augment genes modified the virus.
PHLOX: It became airborne. You should have told me this earlier!
K'VAGH: If you hope to ever leave this place, I suggest you stop asking
questions and resume work.
[Science lab]
{The two women are looking at a mangled black
something.)
HOSHI: What do you think?
T'POL: We may be able to reconstruct the directory with a recursive
algorithm.
HOSHI: Is it unusual to have weird dreams after a mind meld?
T'POL: Subconscious thoughts are often exchanged. They sometimes
surface during sleep.
HOSHI: I had a bizarre dream last night. Commander Tucker was in it. We
were in a strange place. It was all white. There was almost a romantic
quality to it. I don't ever remember dreaming about Commander Tucker
before.
T'POL: Most unusual.
[Ready room]
T'POL: The recorder was erased deliberately.
ARCHER: Malcolm said there might've been a safeguard.
HOSHI: The memory core was wiped by that microdyne coupler.
ARCHER: You're sure.
T'POL: It left a unique magnetic signature.
HOSHI: We found it in storage locker C fourteen. The last person to
access that locker was Lieutenant Reed.
[Ready room - later]
REED: I'm not quite sure what you're getting at,
sir.
ARCHER: Only someone with security clearance of alpha-four or higher
had access to the black box. That's just T'Pol, you and me.
REED: I agree. It is a bit of a mystery.
ARCHER: You're sure that freighter was destroyed by Orion weapons?
REED: There's no doubt.
ARCHER: I asked T'Pol to double-check your analysis. The freighter was
fired on by Klingon disruptors.
REED: With all due respect, sir, it must have been a mistake.
ARCHER: I've seen the sensor logs.
REED: Someone could have tampered with them.
ARCHER: I want to know what the hell is going on. (silence) Answer me,
Lieutenant.
REED: Respectfully, sir, I refuse to answer any more questions.
ARCHER: (into his ear) Malcolm, I never would've believed that you, of
all people.
(He goes to the door, opens it to reveal a MACO waiting)
ARCHER: Corporal. Lieutenant Reed's been relieved of duty. Escort him
to the brig and confine him.
[Brig]
ARCHER: We've set course for Klingon territory. We
haven't picked up any warp signatures yet. I may have to take this ship
into their space. I don't have to tell you how dangerous that is. If
you know where they've taken Phlox.
REED: I have no idea where the Doctor is, Captain. On that, you have my
word.
ARCHER: Your word isn't worth a lot at the moment.
(Archer opens the door and goes into the cell.)
ARCHER: The Malcolm Reed I know would give his life before committing
treason.
REED: I'm not working for the Klingons.
ARCHER: Who, then? You've betrayed everything that uniform stands for.
REED: Captain, There are some obligations that go beyond my loyalty to
you and this crew.
(Archer gestures the MACO to leave them alone.)
ARCHER: What the hell does that mean?
REED: I can't say any more.
ARCHER: You haven't said much of anything. You've told me a lot about
your father, his years in the Royal Navy. Their tradition of honour and
service. How do you think he'll react when he learns you're facing
court-martial?
REED: I wouldn't know, sir.
[Laboratory]
K'VAGH: We're running out of time.
PHLOX: I can't sequence these nucleotides any faster. Perhaps you
should've abducted Doctor Soong. He could've mapped this genome more
efficiently than I can.
ANTAAK: We tried. Soong was under heavy guard.
K'VAGH: If you don't accelerate your efforts, there will be no one left
to cure. The High Council has dispatched the fleet. They have
annihilated N'Vak Colony.
ANTAAK: N'Vak was one of the first planets affected by the plague.
PHLOX: They're massacring the victims?
K'VAGH: The Council will do whatever's required to contain this
outbreak.
PHLOX: General, we're making progress, but I'll need a few weeks to
develop an antiviral agent. It will have to be tested.
K'VAGH: Millions will be infected by then. The Council will not wait!
ANTAAK: How long until the fleet reaches us?
K'VAGH: Five days.
PHLOX: I can't cure this in five days!
ANTAAK: They wouldn't destroy us if they knew we had created Klingon
Augments.
K'VAGH: The experiment failed!
ANTAAK: It succeeded for a brief period. If Phlox and I can find a way
to stabilise the human DNA prior to the onset of stage three, our
Augments would survive. If we're successful, you could use them as
leverage, force the High Council to give us more time to find a cure.
PHLOX: You don't seriously expect me to help you create Klingon
Augments?!
K'VAGH: You could save the inhabitants of this planet.
PHLOX: I won't assist you.
(K'Vagh draws his disrupter from its holster.)
PHLOX: Kill me if you must. I refuse to co-operate.
K'VAGH: Take him.
(Phlox is bustled out of the laboratory.)
[Colombia Bridge]
ERIKA: Hail the dock master. This is Captain
Hernandez. Request permission to depart.
DOCKMASTER [OC]: You're cleared for departure. Smooth sailing,
Columbia.
ERIKA: Thank you.
[Colombia Engineering]
ERIKA [OC]: Bridge to Engineering. Are we ready,
Mister Tucker?
TUCKER: Just a few more seconds. (turns off the comm.) I hope. Ensign?
RIVERS: Dilithium matrix is stable. Driver coils are configured for warp
speed.
TUCKER: Nice work. Engineering to Bridge. We're ready whenever you are,
Captain.
[Colombia Bridge]
ERIKA: Time to weigh anchor. (to the young lady at
the helm) Lieutenant, aft thrusters at one half until we clear
Spacedock. Then take us to warp.
[Brig]
(The MACOs bring in the smooth-foreheaded Klingon
and put him in the other cell.)
REED: So, what are you in for?
MARAB: Is your Captain hoping you'll obtain information from me?
REED: I shouldn't think so.
MARAB: Why are you here?
REED: That's a long story.
MARAB: Entertain me.
REED: I lied to him.
MARAB: You're fortunate to be alive. A Klingon who betrays his Captain
would be immediately executed.
(Marab is developing a nasty cough.)
REED: Why did you and your men board Enterprise? You know, you may find
this hard to believe but, you and I actually want the same thing.
MARAB: And what is that?
REED: A cure. There's no reason for you or any more of your people to
die.
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: There's a malfunction in the intermix
chamber. Plasma pressure's rising.
T'POL: The antimatter flow regulators are locked open.
ARCHER: Did the Klingons damage them?
T'POL: Uncertain.
(Enterprise shakes.)
TRAVIS: Pressure's approaching critical.
ARCHER: Can we drop to impulse?
T'POL: The reactor would breach. But we can reduce pressure by
increasing speed.
ARCHER: Go to maximum warp. (to T'Pol) Get down to Engineering. See
what you can do.
[Brig]
ARCHER: You sabotaged us. How do we repair the
damage? If our reactor breaches, you're going to die with us.
MARAB: I'm a soldier of the Empire. I'm prepared to die.
REED: Captain. You need your tactical officer. Please, sir. I can be
useful!
(But Archer just storms out of the Brig.)
[Engineering]
KELBY: Commander, did you see that?
T'POL: Please be more specific.
KELBY: On the monitor.
(The whole monitor display flickers at regular intervals, displaying
Klingon characters.)
T'POL: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
T'POL: The warp matrix has been compromised
[Corridor]
T'POL [OC]: By a Klingon subroutine.
ARCHER: (into communicator) Can you remove it?
T'POL [OC]: I'm not certain. It's infiltrated our command protocols.
ARCHER: (getting into turbolift) Do what you can.
[Turbolift]
TRAVIS [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer. Pressure's
increasing again.
ARCHER: Take us to warp five point two.
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: Sir, we can't hold that speed for long.
ARCHER [OC]: We're out of options, Travis. Five point two.
TRAVIS: Acknowledged.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Divergence
Divergence
 Original Airdate: 25 Feb, 2005
  T'POL
[OC]: Previously on Enterprise
THUG [San
Francisco]: You, Denobulan, come with us.
ANTAAK [Laboratory]: A
virus is spreading from planet to planet. Millions are already
infected.
PHLOX: What do you want with me?.
ANTAAK: If this continues, the Klingon species will cease to exist.
HARRIS [North Maple - night]:
There's a job that needs doing, Lieutenant. It may be the only way to
save your friend's life.
PHLOX [Laboratory]: You
don't seriously expect me to help you create Klingon augments.
K'VAGH: Take him.
ARCHER [Brig]: The
Malcolm Reed I know would give his life before committing treason.
REED: There are some obligations that go beyond my loyalty to you and
this crew.
(Over scenes of the Klingons sabotaging Enterprise.)
T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: The warp matrix has been compromised by a Klingon
subroutine.
T'POL [Engineering]: It's
infiltrated our command protocols.
TRAVIS [Bridge]:
Pressure's increasing again.
ARCHER [Turbolift]: Take
us to warp five point two.
TRAVIS [Bridge]:
Sir, we can't hold that speed for long.
ARCHER [OC]: We're out of options, Travis. Five point two.
T'POL [OC]: And now, the conclusion.
[Brig]
ARCHER: We have forty seven minutes until our
reactor breaches.
REED: What did the Klingons do to it?.
ARCHER: They altered our engineering subroutines. If we go below warp
five, the reactor's going to explode.
REED: How can I help?
ARCHER: I've just been talking with Trip. Columbia can rendezvous with
us in thirty minutes. He says he can restore
the subroutines.
REED: He can't do that from Columbia.
ARCHER: We're going to bring him onboard.
REED: The transporter won't operate at warp, and docking's out of the
question.
ARCHER: Trip told me you have experience transferring personnel at warp
speed.
REED: In training exercises, yes, and at warp speed one. Every move was
rehearsed in simulators for weeks.
ARCHER: We don't have weeks.
REED: We'll have to merge our warp field with Columbia's.
ARCHER: T'Pol's doing the calculations now. At warp five, we'll have to
move within fifty metres of each other.
REED: Has anyone ever done this before?
ARCHER: Travis can handle the flying. Can you get Trip over here?
REED: You'll have to let me out of this Brig.
[Colombia Bridge]
(The four double-columns of lights are pulsing away
behind the Captain's chair.)
ERIKA: Commander Tucker.
[Colombia Launch bay]
ERIKA [OC]: Are you ready for this?
TUCKER: (in full EV suit) As ready as I'll ever be.
[Colombia Bridge]
ERIKA: Open a channel.
[Situation room]
ERIKA [OC]: Columbia to Enterprise.
ARCHER: This is Archer.
ERIKA [OC]: We're matching speed and trajectory as requested.
ARCHER: Stand by, Columbia. Archer to Reed.
[Launch bay]
REED: (also fully suited up) Go ahead.
ARCHER [OC]: We're in position.
REED: Have them start their rotation.
(Colombia turns over so the two ships are running keel to keel.)
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: Coming up on one hundred metres. Ninety,
eighty metres.
ARCHER: This is the Bridge. All hands brace for warp field contact.
[Launch bay]
(Reed watches Colombia appear in the open launch
door. Enterprise jolts as they get close.)
REED: Hold her steady, Travis
[Bridge]
REED [OC]: Or Chef'll know who to blame for the
mess in the Galley.
TRAVIS: We're at fifty metres and holding.
ARCHER: Make sure everything's ready for Trip in Engineering.
(T'Pol leaves the Bridge)
ARCHER: Archer to Reed. You're all clear.
REED [OC]: Understood.
[Launch bay]
REED: Columbia, I'm deploying the tether.
[Colombia Launch bay]
(The grappler whizzes out between the two ships and
hits the ceiling within arms reach of Tucker standing on the steps.)
TUCKER: Nice shooting, Malcolm.
(Tucker attaches himself to the line.)
TUCKER: Tucker to Captain Hernandez.
ERIKA [OC]: Go ahead.
TUCKER: I'm heading out.
ERIKA [OC]: Quick as you can, Commander.
[Between the ships]
TUCKER: Never thought I'd see the stars like this.
[Colombia Bridge]
ERIKA: Eyes on the cable, Commander. I need you
back here in one piece.
[Launch bay]
REED: You're doing fine, Trip.
(Enterprise shakes again.)
[Bridge]
ARCHER: T'Pol, what's happening?
[Engineering]
T'POL: I'm reading a fluctuation in the warp field.
ARCHER [OC]: Take power from life support if you have to.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: But keep the field constant.
TRAVIS: Sir, I'm having trouble holding position. Fifty two metres.
Fifty five.
[Just outside Enterprise Launch bay]
TUCKER: Don't mean to be a pest, but could someone
tell me what's going on?
REED: You're almost here, Trip. Keep going.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Engineering, report!
[Engineering]
T'POL: I'm rerouting power now, Captain. Stand by.
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: Fifty nine metres.
[Launch bay]
(Tucker appears to have made it inside the doors.)
REED: The tether's at its limit! Hurry up!
[Engineering]
T'POL: T'Pol to the Bridge. It's not working. The
field is still fluctuating.
[Launch bay]
REED: Almost there!
(Tucker reaches Reed, and he gets him unhooked from the line just
before the unit gets pulled off the ceiling and goes flying into
space.)
REED: Trip!
TUCKER: Permission to come aboard?
REED: Bridge, I have him.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: You all right, Trip?
[Launch bay]
TUCKER: I'll feel a lot better when this is over.
There's only one way to do this, Captain. A cold start. I have to shut
down the reactor and re-set the algorithms. Once we bring the warp
engine back online, the subroutines should be back to normal.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: But if we shut down the reactor.
TUCKER [OC]: That's why we need to move inside Columbia's warp field.
[Launch bay]
TUCKER: They can sustain our speed while I
reinitialize the engines.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: They won't be able to hold us for more than
a minute or two. They don't have enough power.
[Launch bay]
TUCKER: I've got a shortcut in mind.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Shortcut?
TUCKER [OC]: Those subroutines
[Launch bay]
TUCKER: Would take hours to decrypt. Better just to
purge them wipe them clean.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: I'll contact Columbia.
[Corridor]
(Tucker and Reed have taken off their EV suits, and
the two MACOs are waiting.)
TUCKER: What're they here for?
REED: The Captain and I have had a slight misunderstanding.
TUCKER: How slight?
REED: These gentlemen are here to escort me back to the Brig. Don't
worry, I'll tell you all about it when we're not quite so busy.
(They head off in opposite directions.)
[Engineering]
TUCKER: Fancy meeting you here. Intermix pressure?
T'POL: Fifteen twenty seven.
TUCKER: Field variance?
T'POL: Eighty seven millicochranes.
TUCKER: Somebody hasn't been taking very good care of my engine.
T'POL: Speak with the Klingons. What are you doing?
TUCKER: You might want to take notes. I'm about to perform a manual
shut-down and restart in less than two minutes.
T'POL: That's not possible.
TUCKER: Watch me.
(He climbs onto the top of the engine.)
[Colombia Bridge]
ERIKA: Columbia to Enterprise.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Go ahead.
ERIKA [OC]: I've routed everything I've got to my warp field.
[Colombia Bridge]
ERIKA: Do me a favour, Jonathan. Make this quick.
(With the twin ships still flying belly to belly, the warp fields merge
into one.)
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Archer to Trip. Ready when you are.
[Engineering]
TUCKER: Stand by! Everyone get away from the
bulkheads! It's going to get a little hot in here!
(He does something quick and nasty to a relay in the warp engine, then
dashes down the ladders.)
TUCKER: Reactor shut down in five, four, three, two, one!
(There's a big bright bang, and everything switches off.)
TUCKER: T'Pol, prime the injectors. Jenkins, man the relays!
JENKINS: Yes, sir!
(Tucker goes to the warp engine controls and starts ripping out
mother-boards.)
[Colombia Bridge]
ERIKA: Colombia to Enterprise. You've got about
forty seconds.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Understood.
[Engineering]
ARCHER [OC]: Trip, how's it going?
TUCKER: Just another minute, Captain.
ARCHER [OC]: You don't have a minute!
TUCKER: Get ready to initialise the matrix.
[Colombia Bridge]
ERIKA: Enterprise, we're losing the field.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Fifteen seconds, Trip.
[Engineering]
TUCKER: Almost there. Full power to containment!
Fire up the antimatter stream!
ARCHER [OC]: Ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six.
T'POL: Commander!
TUCKER: Here we go!
ARCHER: Four, three, two.
(The warp field flares bright again around the two ships as the engine
comes back to life.)
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: We've got warp power.
[Engineering]
T'POL: Engineering to the Bridge. The subroutines
have been purged.
ARCHER [OC]: Appreciate the house call, Mister Tucker.
TUCKER: Any time. I'd like to drop to impulse for a while
[Bridge]
TUCKER [OC]: Captain, just to check things over.
ARCHER: Stand by. Enterprise to Columbia. Thanks for the lift.
[Colombia Bridge]
ERIKA: You're not getting away with my Chief
Engineer that easily.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Any plans for the next few days?
[Colombia Bridge]
ERIKA: What've you got in mind?
[Qu'Vat Colony]
(Antaak makes his way surreptitiously to where
Phlox has been dumped on a bed)
ANTAAK: Phlox. Phlox. This will help. (but Phlox rejects the bottle) My
apologies for the General's conduct. So cruel. This is no way to treat
a man of science.
(Phlox is in great discomfort or pain.)
PHLOX:
Then end it. Contact Starfleet.
ANTAAK: My people need you, Phlox. We have no healers with your
abilities.
PHLOX: You want me to create Klingon Augments. Living weapons. I won't
do it.
ANTAAK: No, no. I've been reviewing your work. It's brilliant. You have
discovered a weakness in the virus causing the plague. If we interrupt
the transcription sequence here (shows him a PADD)
PHLOX: Yes. Yes. That would stop the genetic effects of the virus in
stage one. There'd be changes of appearance, some minor neural
reordering, but no development of stage two characteristics. No
enhanced strength or speed or endurance. But then General K'Vagh would
not get his Augments. He would never allow it.
ANTAAK: What if we don't tell him?
PHLOX: Do you understand what will happen if the General learns that
we've deceived him?
ANTAAK: A cure would save millions of innocent lives. What more
honourable death could there be for a healer,
Klingon or Denobulan?
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. I've asked
Columbia to join us in our search for Phlox. We'll have a better chance
of making it through Klingon territory with twice the firepower.
[Corridor]
(Reed is being manhandled along by two MACOs.)
REED: I don't suppose you can tell me where I'm going this time? No, I
didn't think so.
[Reed's quarters]
(Archer has got an image of Harris up on Reed's
monitor.)
REED: Those are my personal files.
ARCHER: Not when they affect my ship. T'Pol restored everything you
tried to erase. We ran his face and voiceprint through our database.
His name is Harris. He worked in Starfleet Security up till five years
ago. After that, his file ends.
REED: Captain, there's nothing more I can add.
ARCHER: I won't accept that. You endangered every member of this crew.
You answer to me. I thought I knew
you, Malcolm. Whatever hold this Harris has on you, you could have come
to me.
REED: I'm under orders.
ARCHER: I'm your commanding officer! If you don't tell me what's going
on, I'll go to Starfleet. Whatever you think you've been trying to keep
hidden, Is that what you want? Is that what you want?!
REED: I can't tell you what I don't know.
ARCHER: Then let me talk to someone who can. Send a message to Harris.
[Laboratory]
ANTAAK: Has the House of Phlox always been one of
healers?
PHLOX: There is no, uh, House of Phlox. Denobulan family units are
different from Klingons.
ANTAAK: Ah, yes. I've heard. Three wives for each husband. Three
husbands for each wife. Your mating practices must be very complex.
PHLOX: Wondrously so. What about the House of Antaak?
ANTAAK: We are a warrior caste. When I became a healer, my father
disowned me.
PHLOX: As a physician in the Imperial Fleet, you've served in the
military.
ANTAAK: Not as well as I should have. I did not screen my subjects
properly. This plague, all its victims, it's my fault. My failure is
the reason you're here.
[Qu'Vat Colony]
(The group of augmented Klingons who boarded
Enterprise come to make their report.)
LANETH: (a female) The humans could not stop us.
K'VAGH: I am your superior. You will salute.
(She does so, sarcastically.)
K'VAGHNow, report.
LANETH: Enterprise was destroyed. Starfleet will think it was her
engines.
K'VAGH: One of you is missing.
LANETH: Your son was slow. The humans killed him.
K'VAGH: Did he die with honour?
LANETH: He let humans kill him.
[Laboratory]
K'VAGH: Report.
ANTAAK: Doctor Phlox has made excellent progress.
K'VAGH: Details.
PHLOX: I've identified the RNA sequences that code
K'VAGH: Details I can pass on to my superiors.
PHLOX: I know where to look for the switch that will turn off the
virus.
K'VAGH: How long until you find it?
PHLOX: An hour.
K'VAGH: One hour.
(K'Vagh goes to a room, possibly his office, and contacts another
Klingon via his computer monitor.)
[Krell's warship]
KRELL: What do you want?
[Qu'Vat Colony]
K'VAGH: I have news for the High Council.
[Krell's warship]
KRELL: Explain.
K'VAGH [OC]: The Denobulan is close to perfecting the Augment's genome.
KRELL: The Council has shut down your project.
K'VAGH [on monitor]: If you sterilise this colony, then all our
research will be lost.
[Qu'Vat Colony]
KRELL [on monitor]: The fleet will reach you in
three days. If you're successful by the time we enter orbit, Qu'Vat
will be spared.
[Situation room]
TUCKER: Captain, it's going to be a while before
everything's back to normal in Engineering.
ARCHER: Can Kelby handle it?
TUCKER: I could pull a little double duty to help him out. I could
check with Captain Hernandez.
ARCHER: Something else?
TUCKER: What the hell's going on with Malcolm?
ARCHER: Nothing I can get into right now.
TUCKER: Fair enough. Guess I'd better get back to Columbia.
T'POL: I'll walk with you.
[Corridor]
T'POL: Are you enjoying your time aboard Columbia?
TUCKER: Sure. Why wouldn't I?
T'POL: You haven't been experiencing any problems?
TUCKER: Such as?
T'POL: Adjusting to new food, new routines, trouble sleeping.
TUCKER: I sleep just fine. How about you?
T'POL: Fine.
TUCKER: You sure about that?
T'POL: Quite.
[Laboratory]
K'VAGH: Your hour is up.
PHLOX: We're getting the test results now.
K'VAGH: We are running out of time!
PHLOX: General, I know the Klingon fleet is on its way, and I
understand what this project cost you, personally. Antaak told me about
your son.
K'VAGH: He died in combat for the Empire.
PHLOX: At least he was spared the final stage of this disease. May I
ask how he was infected?
K'VAGH: Command chose his unit for the augment experiment when we had
exhausted our supply of prisoners.
My son was a warrior. He asked for no special treatment, and I gave him
none.
[Brig]
(Reed can't cut his meat with the plastic knife,
and Marab throws his meal against the wall.)
REED: What'd they give you?
MARAB: It's dead. I can't eat that. No wonder you're all so weak.
REED: Physical strength isn't everything.
MARAB: Well, you can't win wars without it.
REED: Being smart is more important. General Sun Tzu said that the
greatest victories are those won without fighting.
MARAB: The great Kahless said there's no victory without combat.
REED: Do you ever question why you fight?
MARAB: Soldiers don't question. They obey.
REED: What if your superiors are wrong?
MARAB: They're imprisoned, or killed.
REED: That's not how we do things in Starfleet.
MARAB: Which is why the Klingon Empire will defeat you.
REED: Then how come you're in the same Brig that I'm in?
[Qu'Vat Colony]
(K'Vagh is meeting his Augment team in their
barracks.)
LANETH: You said we'd become stronger. This is what you've done to us.
K'VAGH: He will become infectious soon. He should be quarantined.
LANETH: We'll remain here. If we're going to die, we'll die together as
comrades.
K'VAGH: Be patient, Lieutenant. The Denobulan is working to stabilise
the human DNA. You will all be healthy again, and stronger than any
Klingon.
LANETH: Will he restore our appearance?
K'VAGH: I don't know.
LANETH: How do you expect us to return home looking like this? We will
be outcasts. There will be no place for us in the Empire.
K'VAGH: Your heart is still Klingon.
LANETH: Are you certain of that? During the battle with the Starfleet
ship I felt fear for the first time since I was a child. I wasn't
alone. I could see it in the eyes of the others. We've become like
them. Weak, cowardly. It would be better for us to die.
K'VAGH: As long as I draw breath, the Empire will not turn its back on
you.
[Archer's quarters]
(Porthos is on the bed, sulking.)
ARCHER: I get the feeling you miss Phlox, too. Maybe it's just the
stash of cheese he's got in Sickbay. (his monitor beeps) Hold that
thought.
HARRIS [on monitor]: Captain Archer, I'm told you have some questions
for me.
ARCHER: Where's my doctor?
HARRIS [on monitor]: He's safe, on a mission of great importance to
Starfleet.
ARCHER: Phlox was kidnapped. Starfleet would never authorise that.
HARRIS [on monitor]: Reread the Charter, Article 14, Section 31. There
are a few lines that make allowances for bending the rules during times
of extraordinary threat.
ARCHER: What threat?
HARRIS [on monitor]: Take your pick. Earth's got a lot of enemies.
ARCHER: Klingons attacked my ship. Is that what we're talking about?
HARRIS [on monitor]: What I want to talk about is Lieutenant Reed. He's
done good work for us over the years. Don't be too hard on him. He was
just following my orders.
ARCHER: You put him in an impossible position.
HARRIS [on monitor]: I can understand why you would feel that way, but
this is bigger than one captain and one ship.
ARCHER: You're going to have to do better than that.
HARRIS [on monitor]: All I can tell you is that if you interfere before
Phlox completes his assignment, the repercussions will
affect entire worlds.
[Laboratory]
(Phlox is holding four vials of green stuff.)
PHLOX: One of these four strains has the genetic trigger that can
neutralise the virus before it advances to its lethal stage.
K'VAGH: Which one?
PHLOX: I don't know yet. That's why I have to check each of them.
K'VAGH: How long will it take?
PHLOX: A week. Your fleet can quarantine this world while I complete my
tests. Sterilisation is not necessary.
K'VAGH: Fleet Admiral Krell will not extend his deadline.
PHLOX: The only possible way to get results on Krell's schedule is to
infect four healthy Klingons!
K'VAGH: You have four right here!
PHLOX: Only one of these strains will work. The other three will be
lethal. Ethically, it's unthinkable.
K'VAGH: The ethics, Doctor, are simple. Three lives to save millions.
(Antaak doesn't look too keen on the idea.)
[Ready room]
REED: At first, it didn't seem like lying.
ARCHER: What else would you call it?
REED: Covert operations. I was a young ensign, it was exciting.
ARCHER: How do you feel about it now?
REED: I thought it was done. This is the first time that Harris has
contacted me since I've served on Enterprise. He told me about the
plague. He said they needed Phlox to help the Klingons find a cure. I
was supposed to just slow us down.
ARCHER: Did Harris tell you about this?
(He hands over a PADD,)
ARCHER: I had T'Pol take a closer look at our prisoner's medical scans.
REED: It's human DNA.
ARCHER: I'm guessing the plague is a side effect of a military
experiment that went wrong.
REED: I didn't know.
ARCHER: Harris claims he's doing this because Starfleet needs a stable
Klingon Empire.
REED: Do you believe him?
ARCHER: I don't trust him. If the Klingons needed our help, there are
easier ways to get it.
REED: I wanted to tell you everything, Captain.
ARCHER: There's a way out of this. I don't have to put you back in the
Brig, but you have to choose where your loyalties lie.
REED: I wasn't told where Phlox was taken, but Starfleet intelligence
believe that Klingons have a genetic research facility on Qu'Vat
Colony.
[Bridge]
(The turbolift door opens to reveal Reed with
Archer. T'Pol stands and heads turn.)
ARCHER: As you were.
(Reed takes back his station from a woman.)
ARCHER: How long until we reach Qu'Vat?
TRAVIS: Six hours, sir.
REED: Captain, we need to be ready for Klingon patrols. I suggest that
Columbia withdraws to a safer distance
so that we don't make a single target.
ARCHER: Open a channel to Captain Hernandez.
[Laboratory]
(Antaak and the other two Klingons are in the
background.)
PHLOX: Why did you think you'd succeed in perfecting Augments when
Doctor Soong failed?
K'VAGH: Soong's mistake was that he made too few of them.
PHLOX: The Earth once had thousands. They became tyrannical and started
a war.
K'VAGH: Klingons have discipline.
PHLOX: Augments don't. Their increased aggression is matched by their
decreased inhibitions. You'd lose control of them, just as humans did.
(Phlox injects K'Vagh.)
K'VAGH: How long until we know which one of us survives?
PHLOX: An hour, at most.
K'VAGH: Would bloodwine affect the results?
PHLOX: I don't believe so.
(K'Vagh produces a flask from an inside pocket.)
K'VAGH:
Then we shall drink to the bravery of these warriors! Doctor?
PHLOX: Never on the job.
[Sickbay]
(Marab is on a biobed, coughing.)
ARCHER: We know Phlox was taken to Qu'Vat Colony to work on a cure.
We're going to be there in less than an hour.
MARAB: Krell's patrols will crush you.
REED: They've all been recalled to enforce quarantine zones.
ARCHER: Phlox will be in the medical facility. We need the
co-ordinates. If you don't want to help us, help your people.
[Qu'Vat Colony]
(Phlox has gone to the Augment's barracks.)
LANETH: My brothers?
PHLOX: They're quite ill. So are you. Try to rest.
ANTAAK: (entering) Doctor. The two guards are displaying the first
symptoms.
PHLOX: That accounts for two of the three lethal strains.
ANTAAK: So either General K'Vagh lives, or I do. (Phlox scans him) It's
the General, isn't it? His strain has the cure.
PHLOX: If we work quickly, there's a chance we can treat you in time.
[Krell's warship]
(The Fleet Admiral is eating live gagh when his
monitor beeps.)
KRELL: What now?
HARRIS [on monitor]: There's been a complication.
KRELL: Another one?
HARRIS [on monitor]: This time, your people failed to stop Enterprise.
It's on its way to Qu'Vat, with Columbia.
KRELL: Order them to withdraw.
HARRIS [on monitor]: You know I don't have that authority.
KRELL: Then I'll destroy them.
HARRIS [on monitor]: We had an arrangement!
KRELL: You did what I wanted. I don't need you anymore.
HARRIS [on monitor]: You agreed that both our governments would benefit
if the two of us worked together.
KRELL: And you believed me. 
[Laboratory]
PHLOX: Load the amino acids. I'll extract the viral
DNA from his blood.
(The door opens, and an armed man in a Starfleet uniform enters.)
PHLOX: Captain.
ARCHER: You all right?
PHLOX: Better now that you are here.
MARAB: Father.
K'VAGH: I was told that you had been killed.
MARAB: The humans spared me.
ARCHER: I came to get my doctor back.
K'VAGH: We need him here.
ARCHER: I have two ships in orbit, heavily armed.
PHLOX: Gentlemen, please. I think I can speak for myself. Captain. I
need a little more time to cure this plague.
K'VAGH: Cure? You were supposed to be perfect the Augment genome!
PHLOX: I lied. Your son may be alive, but he will not survive much
longer unless I don't complete my work. A few hours, Captain, that's
all I ask. Several million patients are counting on it.
[Bridge]
REED: Commander, three Klingon battlecruisers have
just dropped out of warp.
T'POL: Open a channel to Columbia.
HOSHI: The Klingons are jamming everything.
[Laboratory]
(A klaxon sounds.)
MARAB: What is it?
K'VAGH: Krell's ships are here.
ARCHER: Keep working. Archer to Enterprise. Tell the Klingons we have
the cure. Enterprise, respond!
KRELL [OC]: This is Fleet Admiral Krell.
[Klingon Bridge]
KRELL: I'm under orders to eradicate this colony.
[Laboratory]
ARCHER: You don't have to do that. My doctor can
stop the plague.
[Klingon Bridge]
KRELL: I have a more effective solution.
[Laboratory]
PHLOX: Hello, Admiral Krell. This is Doctor Phlox.
I am transmitting the details of an antivirus. Feel free to have your
physicians confirm my findings, and you're welcome to call with any
questions.
KRELL [OC]: My orders are clear.
[Klingon Bridge]
KRELL: Captain Archer, your ships are now the
property of the Klingon Empire. Stand down or be destroyed! Proceed as
planned. Leave nothing standing.
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: The lead ship's moving into a lower orbit.
REED: They're charging weapons.
T'POL: Intercept course. Columbia?
HOSHI: I can't get through.
REED: They're firing on the colony.
T'POL: Target their disruptors!
[Laboratory]
(The room rocks to weapons fire.)
ARCHER: How strong are the shields around this place?
K'VAGH: Not strong enough. You said you had two ships in orbit!
ARCHER: I'm sure they're doing everything they can. Archer to
Enterprise.
[Bridge]
(As Enterprise makes another pass on Krell's ship,
the other two Klingons chase and attack.)
REED: They're closing from astern. (explosions) Aft cannons are down.
(Then Colombia swoops in to the rear of the Klingons.)
{Colombia Bridge]
ERIKA: Columbia to Enterprise. Looked like you
could use a hand. Let's keep those ships off their tail.
[Laboratory]
K'VAGH: Your ships are taking damage.
ARCHER: How much longer?
PHLOX: As I said, in another few hours.
ARCHER: Can you speed that up a little? Phlox, I've got an idea. If we
want to get out of here in one piece, we've got to get that cure, and
we're got to get it fast.
PHLOX: I could finish the antivirus in less time if I had a human host
to replicate enough antibodies.
ARCHER: I don't see any other humans around.
PHLOX: Captain, I would have to expose you to the plague. I cannot
predict what it might do to you.
ARCHER: Will it give you the cure?
PHLOX: Unquestionably.
ARCHER: Let's get started.
K'VAGH: What do you intend to do?
ARCHER: This virus may be our best weapon against Krell. Ready when you
are.
(Phlox straps him into the chair.)
[Colombia Bridge]
TACTICAL: One of the ships is losing power. Their
port nacelle is vulnerable.
ERIKA: Then fire at will.
[Laboratory]
PHLOX: In addition to the virus, I'm injecting you
with a metabolic catalyst to accelerate your immune response.
It won't be pleasant.
[Bridge]
REED: It's no use. I can't penetrate their shields.
HOSHI: Commander. I've broken through their jamming frequencies.
T'POL: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
[Laboratory]
T'POL [OC]: Captain, respond!
PHLOX: Doctor Phlox here. The Captain is indisposed at the moment.
[Bridge]
PHLOX: I imagine you have your hands full up there.
T'POL: To say the least.
[Laboratory]
(Archer is writhing in pain.)
PHLOX: We have a plan to defuse this situation, but we'll need a few
more minutes to carry it out. I'd appreciate it if you could keep the
ceiling from caving in on us until then.
T'POL [OC]: Understood.
[Bridge]
T'POL: How much hull plating do we have left?
REED: Sixty two percent.
T'POL: Mister Mayweather, put us directly between that cruiser and the
colony. You may want to divert all available power to our dorsal
plating.
REED: Aye, aye.
[Laboratory]
PHLOX: It's working.
(Archer starts to grow forehead ridges)
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: They're shifting their orbit.
T'POL: Stay with them.
REED: Hull plating's down to forty percent.
T'POL: Keep firing. Captain Hernandez, please direct your weapons at
the battle cruiser.
[Colombia Bridge]
ERIKA: Wish I could help. We just lost our weapons!
[Laboratory]
(Archer is breaking his restrains, so K'Vagh holds
him.)
PHLOX: It's done! Hold him!
(He takes blood from Archer.)
PHLOX: We've got it. Is the canister ready?
ANTAAK: It's set to disperse five seconds after transport.
PHLOX: Send it. Open a channel to Krell.
(Antaak beams the canister away.)
[Bridge]
REED: Hull plating's nearly down. We can't hold
this position much longer.
[Laboratory]
PHLOX: Admiral Krell. Doctor Phlox again. By now
you may have noticed the
[Klingon Bridge]
PHLOX [OC]: Small package which we sent to your
Bridge. What you may not know is that it contains a potent sample of
the metagenic virus. Even as we speak it is dispersing throughout your
ship, infecting you and your crew.
KRELL: You're lying!
PHLOX [OC]: Check your internal sensors. You will find
[Laboratory]
PHLOX: That the atmosphere contains approximately
twenty parts per million of the viral strain. Or if you don't trust
your sensors, trust your senses. You will feel the initial symptoms in
about thirty minutes. A tightness in the chest, irregular heartbeat
[Klingon Bridge]
PHLOX [OC]: Tingling in your cranial ridges.
KRELL: This is a cowardly attack!
[Laboratory]
PHLOX: Maybe so. But I'm prepared to give you the
cure. Thanks to Captain Archer, I've managed to complete the antivirus.
Of course, if you destroy this colony, well, treating you and your crew
could prove difficult. I suggest you power down your weapons, Admiral,
and let me cure your people.
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Admiral Krell has
convinced the High Council to call off their sterilisation programme.
They've promised to distribute Phlox's cure throughout the Empire.
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: There's no trace of the virus in your
bloodstream.
(Antaak touches his smooth forehead.)
ANTAAK:
My targ won't even recognise me.
PHLOX: In the future, it may be possible to reverse the cosmetic
effects.
ANTAAK: I suppose this is what I deserve. Millions of my people will
have to live with this disfigurement. It'll be passed on to our
children. Life won't be easy for us.
PHLOX: You did your best to correct your mistakes. That's all we can
ask of ourselves.
ANTAAK: I doubt my superiors will allow me to remain in my position.
I'll need to find a new specialty. Perhaps cranial reconstruction.
PHLOX: I have a feeling that's about to become very popular.
(T'Pol and Captain Hernandez enter, and go to Archer's biobed.)
ANTAAK: I'm grateful for everything that you've done.
T'POL: How are you feeling?
(Archer has slight cranial ridges.)
ARCHER:
Not too bad aside, from some strange cravings. A plate full of live
gagh sounds pretty good right now.
PHLOX: The cravings should disappear in a day or so, along with your
ridges.
TUCKER: No, I'd keep them if I were you, Captain. It makes you look
intimidating.
ERIKA: I should be get back on the road.
ARCHER: One of us needs to get some exploring done. Thanks for your
help.
ERIKA: I don't know how you survived all these years without me.
(She leaves.)
T'POL: Shouldn't you be joining her?
ARCHER: I asked Trip to stick around for a little while to help us out
with repairs.
T'POL: Indeed. Our new Chief Engineer will no doubt be delighted for
the help.
TUCKER: No, Kelby's got nothing to worry about. I'm only here
temporarily.
[Reed's quarters]
(Reed is lying on his bunk, reading, when the
monitor beeps.)
REED: What do you want?
HARRIS [on monitor]: I called to thank you. Everything went according
to our projections. The Empire's been stabilised.
I doubt very much they'll be experimenting with Augments anytime soon.
REED: We could've explained everything to Captain Archer.
HARRIS [on monitor]: That's not how Krell wanted things done.
REED: Since when do we do things the way the Klingons want?
HARRIS [on monitor]: When it's in our interest. I had to keep certain
details from you as well. I hope there are no hard feelings. This
mission wouldn't have succeeded without you, Lieutenant.
REED: Don't ever contact me again. Is that clear?
HARRIS [on monitor]: Maybe you didn't understand our recruitment
policy. You can't simply walk away.
REED: I answer to one Commanding Officer. Jonathan Archer.
HARRIS [on monitor]: Lieutenant, why don't we

Bound
 Mission date: Dec 27, 2154
Original Airdate: 25 Mar, 2005

Captain's Starlog, December 27, 2154. We're on course for the
Berengarius system, a potential site for the first in a series of
proposed Starbases.
 [Bridge]
T'POL: A Vulcan science vessel surveyed the seventh
planet over fifty years ago. The file states it's an M class world with
a flourishing ecosystem. No intelligent life.
ARCHER: Sounds promising.
T'POL: They did report one distinctive feature which bears mentioning.
ARCHER: And that is?
T'POL: A species of flying reptile, some reportedly over two hundred
metres long. They're also said to breathe fire. There's been lingering
questions over the accuracy of this report.
ARCHER: Can't wait to find out.
REED: There's a ship. It's on an intercept course.
T'POL: I don't recognise the configuration.
ARCHER: Let's see it.
(A rounded, green ship is on the viewscreen.)
REED: Doesn't look very friendly.
ARCHER: Tactical Alert. Let's see what they want, Hoshi.
HOSHI: They're responding.
(The caller is green, wearing leather and with bits of metal on his
head.)
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: Captain Archer.
ARCHER: And you are?
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: Harrad-Sar. Deactivate your weapon systems
immediately, or I'll be forced to open fire. (pause for opening
sequence) You're still targeting my ship.
ARCHER: And you're targeting mine. It seems we're at an impasse.
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: Not for long.
ARCHER: Instead of sitting here pointing guns at each other, why don't
we deactivate our weapons together?
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: Very well. (snaps fingers)
ARCHER: Now, what can we do for you?
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: I have a proposal to make.
ARCHER: I'm listening.
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: I prefer to discuss business in person. You're
invited aboard my ship.
ARCHER: We've dealt with your people before. The experience wasn't one
I care to repeat. If you can give me some idea what this is about?
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: What I have to say could smooth relations
between your Starfleet and the Orion Syndicate. My hospitality is
renowned, Captain. I don't offer it to everyone. And once I have been
refused, I never offer it again.
[Corridor and Transporter alcove]
(The two officers are accompanied by two MACOs.)
REED: The last Orions we ran into almost turned nine of our crewmembers
into slaves. Let's at least ask him to come here.
ARCHER: I have a feeling he'd see it as an insult.
REED: I can live with that.
ARCHER: Any chance to improve relations with the Syndicate, I'm willing
to take that risk. Anything to have one less hostile species out there.
(Archer and the two MACOs beam over to the Orion ship.)
[Engineering]
KELBY: Seven of the transfer conduits are back on
line. The eighth is still giving us some trouble.
TUCKER: Did you run a phase diagnostic?
KELBY: Came back negative.
TUCKER: Better work up a bypass.
KELBY: Already underway. (Kelby walks away.)
TUCKER: Kelby. Kelby. (Tucker catches up with him.) TUCKER: We have a problem?
KELBY: I'm not sure what you mean, sir.
TUCKER: Look, the Captain asked me to stick around. As soon as the
repairs are done, I'm back on Columbia.
KELBY: And it's no reflection on me that the Captain wants you to
oversee the work.
TUCKER: That's right. I was his Chief Engineer for four years.
KELBY: Well, it doesn't look like he's ready to let you go. I'd better
get on it.
(Kelby leaves as T'Pol arrives.)
TUCKER: He thinks he's going to lose his promotion.
T'POL: Is there anything I can do to help?
TUCKER: With Kelby?
T'POL: With the engine.
TUCKER: I could use a second pair of eyes on the field matrix. The
pattern's bothering me, and I can't figure out why.
T'POL: I'll take a look at it.
TUCKER: Thanks.
T'POL: Commander, have you been experiencing any unusual daydreams?
TUCKER: Daydreams?
T'POL: Accompanied by intense auditory and visual sensations that would
involve me.
TUCKER: You're wondering if I've been having any daydreams about you?
T'POL: Essentially.
TUCKER: Well, let me think. No, nothing comes to mind.
T'POL: Forget I mentioned it.
TUCKER: Have you been having daydreams about me?
T'POL: It's not important.
TUCKER: You going to tell me what this is about?
T'POL: No.
[Harrad-Sar's ship]
(In a room more like something you'd find on a
planet than a ship, Harrad is serving food and drinks.)
HARRAD: I am a privateer. My allegiance is to myself alone. I earn my
living in various ways. Buying, selling.
REED: Plundering.
HARRAD: When the situation calls for it. Piracy is a risky business. I
prefer commerce. This (the blue drink) is from a planet in the Gorn
Hegemony.
REED: The Gorn?
HARRAD: The less said about them, the better. But they do brew the
finest Meridor in the five systems.
ARCHER: Delicious.
HARRAD: I'm pleased. You have acquired something of a reputation,
Captain.
ARCHER: Favourable, I hope.
HARRAD: Well, you're wanted in the Klingon Empire, the Orion Syndicate.
I don't know. I would imagine such a man would have a more robust
appetite.
ARCHER: With all those people after me, I need to stay quick on my
feet.
HARRAD: Yes.
ARCHER: You said you had something important to discuss with us.
HARRAD: Well, it's poor custom to discuss business before
entertainment. If the food didn't arouse your hunger, this should.
(Enter three skinny green women with their modesty barely covered, who
proceed to dance for the Starfleet men.)
HARRAD: What do you think?
REED: I can't think.
HARRAD: Captain?
ARCHER: I'd have to agree with my tactical officer.
HARRAD: I think she likes you. (He means the one in the red bra.) HARRAD: Her name is
Navaar. She's the most experienced of the three. They're sisters. I
purchased them at a trading post you once visited. Incredible, aren't
they? They can make you forget most of your troubles. Of course,
creatures such as these come with troubles of their own. But women are
the same throughout the galaxy, aren't they?
(The dance ends, the girls leave.)
HARRAD: Now we can talk business.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: He claims he's discovered a planet with
large deposits of magnesite. Enough to build a thousand warp reactors.
And that's just what his scanners could detect. He's offering to give
us the coordinates.
T'POL: Why would he divulge this information?
ARCHER: He doesn't have the infrastructure to get the magnesite out of
the ground.
T'POL: So he wants Starfleet to construct mining facilities.
ARCHER: And he'll get a ten-percent share. He's also promised to help
establish a dialogue between Starfleet and the Orion Syndicate.
T'POL: Are you going to accept his offer?
ARCHER: I already have.
T'POL: I thought you were here seeking my advice.
ARCHER: Harrad-Sar insisted that I accept a gift to celebrate the
transaction. Given the situation, I couldn't refuse.
[Corridor]
(Malcolm is escorting three green women, and
whenever they pass a crewman, another tongue is added to their red
carpet.)
REED: We're on D deck now, where most of the crew quarters are located.
NAVAAR: Where does Captain Archer stay?
REED: On E. That's one deck below us.
MARAS: How many levels are there? (Reed is tongue-tied as she touches him.)
REED: Um. Er. A total of seven. Seven
decks. We've arranged these for you. (To gaping crewmen -) REED: You need
something to do? The other two rooms are right next door. I'll show you
in a moment.
[Navaar's quarters]
NAVAAR: Captain Archer has a very large ship.
REED: It's roomy.
NAVAAR: But everything's so functional. There's no colour.
REED: I hadn't really thought about it, to tell you the truth.
NAVAAR: At least it's private. What's your name?
REED: Lieutenant Reed. Malcolm.
NAVAAR: Pleased to meet you, Lieutenant Reed Malcolm.
(She keeps invading his personal space.)
REED: Malcolm is fine. Well, someone will be by shortly to show you how
everything works. In the meantime, just try to make yourself at home.
Right. This way, ladies.
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. Harrad-Sar has
turned over the coordinates of the planet he described. We're en route
to verify his claims.
[Bridge]
T'POL: I've been hearing some concerns from the
crew.
ARCHER: Concerns?
T'POL: The Orion women. Their presence is becoming disruptive.
ARCHER: You're telling me. The crew isn't used to having Orions on
board.
T'POL: It's more than that. Our guests visited the Mess Hall this
morning. As a result, twelve crewmen reported late for their shifts.
ARCHER: I get the picture.
T'POL: It's primarily their attire.
ARCHER: Or lack of it. (his grin fades away at her look) I'll see about
assigning them some clothes.
T'POL: It might also be a good idea if you have a word with them.
They're still under the impression they belong to you. Unless a new
policy has been instated, I believe Starfleet doesn't condone slavery.
ARCHER: I'll speak to them first chance I get.
T'POL: Thank you.
[Gymnasium]
[Travis is already pumping some serious iron when
Reed enters.)
TRAVIS: Lieutenant. (Reed starts up a running machine.)
REED: Have you seen them yet?
TRAVIS: I ran into one of them in the corridor. They're really
REED: Yeah, I know. I know. What are you trying to do?
TRAVIS: Get them out of my head! The pain helps. You should try it. (Reed stops running and joins Travis on the free weights.)
REED: Yeah, okay.
TRAVIS: When I was on my parents' ship, we picked up some Deltans once.
Their ship was having engine trouble.
REED: I don't know that species.
TRAVIS: The females are unbelievably attractive. Very open about (Travis can't
lift that weight any more.) TRAVIS: I was fifteen. I couldn't think straight. I
could barely breathe. Only thing that got me through it was weight
training with my dad. He said if I was exhausted, idle hands and all
that
REED: Well, did it help?
TRAVIS: Helped my biceps. I'd go heavier.
[Engineering]
(A green goddess strolls in.)
KELBY: What are you doing here?
D'NESH: I wanted to thank you. You were very kind this morning, helping
me find the Mess Hall.
KELBY: It was no problem. Look, I
D'NESH: Wow. Is that the engine?
KELBY: It's the warp reactor.
D'NESH: You can feel the power. You promised you'd show me Engineering.
KELBY: I know.
D'NESH: Harrad-Sar never let us leave our rooms. I've never seen
anything like this place.
KELBY: I could show you around.
D'NESH: If it won't get you into trouble.
KELBY: Come on.
[Sickbay]
HOSHI: What've you got for a headache? (Phlox is not entirely steady on his feet.)
PHLOX: That depends on what's causing
it. How long have you been experiencing this?
HOSHI: A few hours. What is it?
PHLOX: Ensign Keeley was here with a headache several minutes ago.
HOSHI: Is she all right?
PHLOX: Perfectly, just as you are.
HOSHI: It's probably just stress.
PHLOX: There's been plenty of that going around.
HOSHI: Or it could be our new passengers.
PHLOX: The Orion females? Why should they give you a headache?
HOSHI: I'm just not used to seeing guys trip over themselves like that.
PHLOX: Just a little healthy sexual energy. Helps keep the blood
pumping.
HOSHI: If you ask me, it's pumping a little too hard.
PHLOX: I'm surprised at you, Ensign.
HOSHI: Why?
PHLOX: You never struck me as being prone to jealousy. This should do
very nicely.
(Then he falls to the floor.)
HOSHI: Phlox!
PHLOX: It's all right. Well, I must be nearing a sleep cycle.
HOSHI: I thought you just had one.
PHLOX: You're right, I did. A week ago.
[Engineering]
(Tucker is supervising work on the top of the engine.)
TUCKER: It's a good bet the problem's right there. Take it apart.
(The crewman leaves, and then he hears giggling from below.)
KELBY: The injectors feed into the dilithium chamber.
D'NESH: That's where the matter and antimatter mix.
KELBY: That's right.
D'NESH: The crystals let you control the reaction.
KELBY: That's right.
TUCKER: Lieutenant. Talk to you a second? (Kelby somehow tears himself
away from her.) TUCKER: What's going on?
KELBY: Sir?
TUCKER: You're supposed to be recalibrating the EPS taps, not giving a
tour.
KELBY: She's only been here a couple of minutes.
TUCKER: Not to mention the fact that she doesn't have clearance. You
should've checked with me first.
KELBY: Well, I guess I can't do anything right.
TUCKER: Just ask her to leave.
KELBY: No, sir. I'm not through talking to her.
TUCKER: That was an order.
KELBY: And I'm refusing.
TUCKER: What the hell's the matter with you?
KELBY: You've been on my case since the second you got back. That's
what the hell's the matter with me. And I'm telling you, it stops here.
TUCKER: Kelby, you're walking a fine line.
KELBY: So are you, Commander.
TUCKER: You're confined to quarters.
KELBY: And what if I don't want to go?
TUCKER: It's either your quarters or the Brig. Get out of here, now.
[Navaar's quarters]
(Navaar is lying on the bed, playing with her hair,
when the doorbell chimes.)
NAVAAR: Come in.
(Archer enters, and she gets up.)
NAVAAR: I was wondering when you were going to come see me. After all,
I've been your property for two days.
ARCHER: Navaar, you and your sisters don't belong to me, or anyone
else. (Navaar nuzzles his neck.)
NAVAAR: I don't understand.
ARCHER: On my world, slavery's been illegal for hundreds of years.
NAVAAR: Are you saying that you don't want us?
ARCHER: I'm saying that you're here as our guests not our property.
NAVAAR: I've been a slave my entire life, on different worlds, for
different owners. What's going to happen to me?
ARCHER: You're free to start a new life. In the meantime, I've asked my
protocol officer, Hoshi Sato, to brief you on ship's operations. There
are certain areas that are reserved for Starfleet personnel.
NAVAAR: I know what happened in Engineering. I've already spoken to
D'Nesh. I'm sorry.
ARCHER: There's no reason to apologise. It's a big adjustment for the
three of you.
NAVAAR: May I ask you something?
(Now they're sitting on the bed.)
NAVAAR: Do you find me attractive?
ARCHER: I'd be lying if I said no.
NAVAAR: I've known so few honest men. And even though you don't wish to
own me, I still wish to please you. If I choose to do this, (kisses
him) would that violate your ship's protocol?
ARCHER: Not necessarily.
T'POL [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer. Bridge to Captain Archer.
(He breaks the embrace with great reluctance.)
ARCHER: Archer here.
T'POL [OC]: We're coming up on the planet.
ARCHER: I'll be right there.
[Bridge]
(Archer seems drunk or drugged when he finally
arrives on the Bridge.)
REED: I recommend we go to Tactical Alert, sir. We can't be certain
this isn't some kind of a trap.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL: We're already picking up large deposits of magnesite.
ARCHER: Harrad-Sar was telling the truth?
T'POL: It would seem so.
ARCHER: Keep scanning. I want to know how much is down there.
T'POL: Are you feeling all right?
ARCHER: I'm fine.
T'POL: A power reading. Not on the surface, in the upper atmosphere.
ARCHER: A ship?
T'POL: Uncertain.
ARCHER: Try hailing them.
T'POL: The cloud layer is highly ionised. It's obscuring our scanners.
ARCHER: Get us closer, within ten kilometres.
HOSHI: They're not responding.
REED: There it is.
(A ship comes up through the planet's cloud layer.)
T'POL: It's an unknown configuration.
REED: They're locking weapons. Extremely low yield. Barely scratched
us.
T'POL: It's equipped with numerous sensors, most likely a science
vessel. Its presence here could simply be a coincidence.
REED: They're firing again. No damage. They could shoot at us all day.
ARCHER: Phase cannons.
REED: Sir?
T'POL: A phase cannon hit will destroy them.
ARCHER: Which means they won't be shooting at us anymore.
T'POL: If we simply withdraw, they'll most likely cease their attack
and move off.
ARCHER: And maybe they won't. Target them. Lieutenant.
REED: Captain?
ARCHER: Lock phase cannons!
REED: No.
(Archer storms over and pushes Reed out of the way.)
TRAVIS: Sir, they're moving off.
[Kelby's quarters]
(D'Nesh and Kelby are in bed, relaxing in the
afterglow.)
KELBY: I have just as much experience. I'm smarter, younger.
D'NESH: You're better than him.
KELBY: We're the only ones who think that.
D'NESH: Tucker's going to take back his position?
KELBY: He denies it, but I know he's planning on staying.
D'NESH: It doesn't seem fair.
KELBY: It isn't. Let's not talk about it anymore.
(She moves away from his reach.)
KELBY: What?
D'NESH: I'm used to being with men who take what they want.
KELBY: What are you talking about?
D'NESH: You can't let him treat you like this.
KELBY: He's my superior officer. (D'Nesh gets out of bed.) KELBY: Where are you
going?
D'NESH: I thought you were different.
KELBY: Stay. Wait, don't leave.
D'NESH: What would you do to keep me forever?
KELBY: Forever?
D'NESH: What would you do?
KELBY: Anything. Anything you want.
(He gets his reward.)
[Engineering]
(While Tucker is at the main engine controls, Kelby
sneaks in on the upper catwalk and starts messing with a panel. Alarms
are triggered.)
TUCKER: Kelby! What the hell are you doing?
(He drags the engineer from the panel but Kelby knocks him down before
continuing. Tucker gets up, they exchange punches and Kelby is knocked
out.)
TUCKER: Blow the dampeners! Move!
(Enterprise comes to a grinding halt as the warp engines go out.)
[Corridor]
TUCKER: He blew out every junction in the EPS
system. If we hadn't got to him, we might not have a ship under our
feet.
ARCHER: When can we get underway?
TUCKER: I'm not sure we can get underway. He did a pretty thorough job.
[Sickbay]
(Kelby is strapped to a biobed.)
ARCHER: Kelby.
KELBY: I didn't do anything.
ARCHER: Tell me what happened.
KELBY: Whatever he told you, it's a lie.
ARCHER: Three other people were there. They all saw you. Tell me why
you did this.
KELBY: He's trying to get rid of me. Don't listen to him!
ARCHER: Kelby.
PHLOX: Captain, his adrenaline levels are dangerously high. I need to
administer a sedative.
ARCHER: Not till I get some answers first.
PHLOX: In his current state, he can't give you coherent answers.
KELBY: I just want to go back to Engineering.
ARCHER: All right.
KELBY: I just want to go back to Engineering.
PHLOX: (injecting him) Be quiet!
TUCKER: What's wrong with him?
PHLOX: It's the same thing that's affecting everyone on this ship. It's
a highly potent pheromone. When exposed to human males, it accelerates
the metabolism, causing aggression and ultimately a form of delusion.
TUCKER: The Orions?
PHLOX: Women aboard the ship have also been affected. I've received an
increasing number of complaints about headaches and listlessness. I
suspect the pheromone acts as a defence mechanism against competition.
TUCKER: You okay?
PHLOX: It's impacted my sleep cycle. I'm having to rely on stimulants
to stay awake.
ARCHER: Doesn't seem to be affecting you.
PHLOX: I've scanned a good number of the crew. So far, the only people
who haven't been affected are T'Pol and Commander Tucker.
TUCKER: Why me?
PHLOX: I would have to run some more tests, but for the rest of us the
effect seems to be cumulative. The longer we're exposed, the more
pronounced the results are.
[Decon Chamber]
NAVAAR: So, this is what you meant when you said we
were free to start new lives?
ARCHER: (holding up a device) We found this in your quarters.
NAVAAR: It seems we have no privacy either.
ARCHER: It's a communication device. You've been in contact with
Harrad-Sar as recently as two hours ago.
NAVAAR: And if I have?
ARCHER: You were sent here to disable my ship. That was his plan from
the start, wasn't it? NAVAAR: Harrad-Sar contacted me to see if we've
been treated well.
ARCHER: Doctor Phlox believes that prolonged exposure to your
pheromones makes men delusional, and extremely vulnerable to
suggestion. That's how you convinced Kelby to sabotage our engines.
D'NESH: Your crewman acted alone. I had nothing to do with it.
NAVAAR: It seems the only delusion here is your own.
ARCHER: Damn it! It's time to start telling me the truth!
NAVAAR: I'm worried about you, Captain. You don't seem well.
ARCHER: I'm not the one you should be worried about.
NAVAAR: I can see you're not very experienced at making threats.
ARCHER: I'm a lot better at carrying them out.
NAVAAR: We were a gift, nothing more. A true commander would know how
to appreciate such a gesture.
ARCHER: Tell me. When's he going to attack us?
NAVAAR: No one is coming to attack your ship.
(There's only glass between their faces.)
NAVAAR: Please release us.
(She moves towards the door controls, still looking into Archer's eyes,
and he moves with her.)
T'POL: Captain.
(The spell is broken as he realises he nearly let them out)
NAVAAR: I'm obviously not the only woman with power over you.
(Archer and T'Pol leave, so the women start to work on the MACO
guarding them.)
[Corridor]
ARCHER: Get down to Engineering. Do what you can to
help Trip.
T'POL: It's better if I stay on the Bridge.
ARCHER: I don't need you to look after me.
T'POL: You're not immune to these pheromones. Your judgment is
impaired.
ARCHER: I can handle it. We need to get the engines back online. I
don't want to be a sitting duck when Harrad-Sar gets here. You have
your orders.
[Engineering]
T'POL: The Captain asked me to offer my assistance.
TUCKER: Great. You can run through these diagnostics. See if you can
find anything that isn't fried. You really think they're coming after
us?
T'POL: It's likely. The transmissions sent by the Orion females suggest
that Harrad-Sar's ship is getting closer.
TUCKER: You know, I keep thinking back to our first mission, when we
met the Suliban. I was so damn naive. I actually thought it was the
last time we'd have to fight someone.
CREWMAN: I said leave it alone!
CREWMAN 2: Get your hands off me!
TUCKER: Knock if off! That's an order! Start up again, and you'll end
up in the Brig, understand? Now go help Masarro with the injectors.
Now! (to the other crewman) Get back to work. That's the third one in
the last hour.
T'POL: There have been altercations throughout the ship. The Captain's
been affected. I'm concerned about him.
TUCKER: The thing I can't figure out is why I'm immune.
T'POL: That might have something to do with me.
TUCKER: You?
T'POL: There's a long-held belief that when a Vulcan mates, there's a
shared psychic bond.
TUCKER: We didn't mate. Okay, what do you mean by psychic bond?
T'POL: It's difficult to explain. Feelings, thoughts, even images can
be shared.
TUCKER: Those daydreams.
T'POL: What?
TUCKER: When I said before that I wasn't having any daydreams about
you, it wasn't actually true. So if we're bonded, what does this have
to do with me not being affected by the Orions?
T'POL: I'm immune to the pheromones because of my Vulcan physiology.
TUCKER: And you're making me immune?
T'POL: Apparently.
TUCKER: I don't know whether to be relieved or really worried.
[Bridge]
(Archer is pacing like a caged cat when the
proximity sensor sounds.)
ARCHER: Tactical Alert. Distance.
TRAVIS: Four hundred kilometres.
HOSHI: He's hailing us.
ARCHER: Put him up.
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: Can I be of help, Captain? Do you need a tow?
We still have weapons. You're not going to get this ship without one
hell of a fight.
I'd rather I didn't have to kill you, but if that's what it takes. The
Syndicate wants your head, Captain, and they don't really care whether
or not it's attached to your body.
(The Orion ship starts firing at Enterprise.)
REED: He's trying to knock out our weapons.
ARCHER: Then take out his.
(Some shots are exchanged, but the Orion gets in more hits than
Enterprise.)
REED: Forward phase cannons are down.
ARCHER: Protect our aft cannons.
TRAVIS: He's moving too fast.
ARCHER: Archer to Engineering.
[Engineering]
TUCKER: Trip.
ARCHER [OC]: Can we get more power
[Bridge]
ARCHER: To the thrusters?
[Engineering]
TUCKER: I'll see what I can do.
[Bridge]
REED: We just lost aft cannons.
[Engineering]
TUCKER: Try to divert some of the power from the
grav plating.
(As T'Pol does so, he shouts the warning to the rest of his crew)
TUCKER: We're going to be a little lighter on our feet. What the hell,
I've been meaning to lose a few pounds.
T'POL: Reducing gravity plating to ninety percent.
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: Thrusters are back to full.
ARCHER: Hard to starboard.
TRAVIS: We're still too slow.
ARCHER: Torpedoes.
REED: That last hit just took them out.
(Then it all goes quiet)
REED: He's powering down his weapons.
TRAVIS: He's coming about.
(Harrad-Sar launches a grapple, and takes Enterprise in tow.)
ARCHER: Thrusters. Full astern.
REED: It's not enough.
HOSHI: He's hailing.
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: Relax, Captain. Enjoy the ride.
ARCHER: We're not going anywhere.
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: I'm afraid you have an appointment with a pair
of Orion marauders. I don't intend to keep them waiting.
ARCHER: Release my ship!
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: I can see you're upset, and I sympathise, but
it's truly out of my hands. We are both slaves to the situation.
ARCHER: They control you?
HARRAD [on viewscreen]: You finally realise that. Yes, Captain, you've
been operating under a misconception. It is the men who are the slaves,
not the women.
[Engineering]
TUCKER: You seeing what I'm seeing?
T'POL: His grappler's directly above our main deflector reader.
TUCKER: Get up to the bridge. I'll be right behind you.
[Bridge]
(T'Pol goes straight to her station and starts
working.)
ARCHER: The deflector?
T'POL: We can use it to send a positron burst through the towing cable.
If we're lucky, it'll trigger an energy cascade.
ARCHER: And disable his power systems. Do it.
T'POL: T'Pol to Engineering.
[Engineering]
TUCKER: I've almost got it. You'll have to reroute
the main EPS conduit.
[Bridge]
T'POL: Understood.
(The turbolift door opens and the three sisters enter.)
REED: Captain.
NAVAAR: Captain.
REED: Decon chamber, come in.
NAVAAR: There's no one there.
REED: What did you do to my men?
NAVAAR: We asked them to leave, after they released us.
D'NESH: They were very accommodating.
ARCHER: Get off my bridge. (Navaar tries to climb inside Archer's uniform.)
NAVAAR: Is that what you really
want? Because if it is, I will gladly do as you say. I only want to
make you happy. I didn't think you wanted me to go.
T'POL: Captain.
NAVAAR: She's jealous. She'll try anything to keep us apart. She'll
even destroy your ship.
T'POL: Her presence is affecting your judgment.
NAVAAR: Arrest her.
HOSHI: Don't listen.
NAVAAR: Do it.
HOSHI: Captain!
ARCHER: Lieutenant Reed. (Reed is totally distracted by D'Nesh.)
REED: Yes?
ARCHER: Take T'Pol to the Brig.
D'NESH: You heard your Captain.
REED: (drawing his phase pistol) Aye, sir.
(Then Tucker shoots him.)
NAVAAR: Stop him.
(So Tucker shoots Archer and Travis too.)
TUCKER: We're ready.
(T'Pol sends the blue pulse up the towing line. Enterprise is freed and
there is a satisfying explosion inside Harrad's ship.)
T'POL: His engines are down. Weapons as well. It worked.
NAVAAR: Commander Tucker. I'm impressed. I'm beginning to see who's the
true master of this vessel.
TUCKER: Oh, save it. Captain Archer runs this ship. You're
sweet-talking the wrong guy. Let's go.
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. The Orion women
have been returned to Harrad-Sar, who's headed home at very low
impulse.
[Sickbay]
ARCHER: (getting an injection) Okay. (Then he nearly
falls off the biobed.)
PHLOX: The dizziness should fade in a couple of hours.
ARCHER: Glad to hear that.
REED: At least the pheromones are wearing off. I haven't thought about
the Orions for what, a whole ten minutes?
TUCKER: The entire crew's been bumping into walls. It's like someone
spiked the water supply.
PHLOX: The after effects will be around for at least a few days.
ARCHER: Well done.
T'POL: Thank you, Captain.
ARCHER: You'll be glad to know my log won't mention your firing on a
fellow officer.
TUCKER: I appreciate that.
T'POL: A court-martial would hardly be a fitting ending to this
incident. At least we've learned something about the Orions.
REED: Yeah, the women are in charge.
T'POL: It proves that even the most disagreeable species have some
positive attributes.
ARCHER: Was that my imagination?
REED: I don't think so.
ARCHER: It almost sounded like you were making a joke.
TUCKER: At least, trying to make one.
T'POL: I assure you, if I ever decide to make a joke, you'll know about
it.
TUCKER: There it is again.
ARCHER: T'Pol, if I didn't know better, I'd think you were picking up
some of Trip's bad habits.
[Corridor leaving Sickbay]
TUCKER: I guess we proved it again.
T'POL: Proved what?
TUCKER: That you and I make a hell of a team.
T'POL: We do seem to work well together.
TUCKER: Even more now that we're in each other's heads.
T'POL: You're returning to Columbia?
TUCKER: I imagine Captain Hernandez is getting pretty antsy to have her
Chief Engineer back.
T'POL: There are still numerous repairs to be carried out here.
TUCKER: I think Kelby can handle them. He'd been observing my work
pretty carefully, when he wasn't trying to blow up the ship.
T'POL: Kelby is a fine engineer, but he lacks experience.
TUCKER: Why don't you just say it?
T'POL: Say what?
TUCKER: That you want me to come back.
T'POL: I believe I did. I think your presence here would be extremely
beneficial to our operations.
TUCKER: No. That you want me back.
T'POL: I don't know what you mean.
TUCKER: My mistake. See you around.
T'POL: Wait, Trip. I want you to come back.
TUCKER: Then I'll think about it.
T'POL: Trip!
(She kisses him, long and hard.)
TUCKER: Three days ago, I told Captain Hernandez I wanted a transfer
back to Enterprise.
T'POL: Three days ago?
TUCKER: I realised this is where I was meant to be, and that this thing
between us isn't that big of a deal.
T'POL: Agreed.
TUCKER: Guess we got a lot of work to do.

Mirror, Darkly - part 1
 Original Airdate: 22 Apr, 2005
  [Bozeman,
Montana. April 5, 2063]
 (A bunch of ragged humans watch a sleek alien ship
land at their rough and ready camp. It's the movie 'First Contact',
basically, as Zephram Cochrane comes forward to meet their Vulcan
visitors)
VULCAN: Live long and prosper.
(Zephram tries to mimic his salute, then (in close up) we see his hand
go into his coat and pull out a big gun with which he shoots the Vulcan
dead. This is a cue for the rest of the group.)
MAN: Board that ship! Take everything you can!
(And they do, leading us into opening credits with unfamiliar music,
that start the same and then become very different with images of
conflict instead of exploration, and a final logo of Earth with a sword
through it. Anyone else old enough to recognise it?)
Captain's Starlog, January 13, 2155. We've left
Gorlan Station and have set a course to rendezvous with our assault
fleet. Major Reed and the doctor have asked for a few minutes to show
me their latest project.
[Agony Booth]
(A Tellarite in a Starfleet uniform is suffering.)
REED: (in MACO uniform) The Booth will be far more effective than our
previous disciplinary methods.
PHLOX: It can stimulate the pain centre of virtually any humanoid. A
synaptic scan calibrates it for each species.
ARCHER: They call this progress.
FORREST: There's something to be said for a good, old-fashioned
flogging.
REED: Well, that's what's so exceptional about this device. Traditional
forms of punishment can overwhelm the nervous system. After a time, the
brain ceases to feel anything.
PHLOX: These sensors continually shift the stimulation from one nerve
cluster to another, keeping the subject in a constant state of agony.
FORREST: I think you enjoy your work too much, Doctor.
ARCHER: What exactly did Mister Terev do?
REED: I'm not certain. I suspect he was late for his duty shift. Aren't
all Tellarites guilty of something?
(Forrest leaves, and Archer scurries after him.)
[Corridor]
ARCHER: Did you get a chance to look over my
proposal?
FORREST: I read it.
ARCHER: And?
FORREST: We're going to rendezvous with the fleet as ordered. I'm not
going into Tholian space based on data from some anonymous source.
Maybe you haven't heard, but we have a rebellion to put down. The
Tholians aren't part of it.
ARCHER: You saw the data. This technology would give us a tactical
advantage. We could end the war tomorrow.
FORREST: You see this as your big chance, don't you?
ARCHER: Sir?
FORREST: You bring that ship home, and you'll be a hero. The Emperor
pins a medal on your chest. You might even get that command you've
always wanted.
ARCHER: My only concern is saving the Empire.
FORREST: Resume your station.
ARCHER: Captain, you're making a mistake.
FORREST: You can either go back to the Bridge or take the place of that
Tellarite. Which do you prefer?
ARCHER: Understood.
[Forrest's quarters]
(They seem somewhat larger than we're used to.)
HOSHI: (in flimsy black negligee) What do you think you're doing?
FORREST: Reviewing status reports.
HOSHI: This is supposed to be your sanctuary. A place to get away from
status reports.
(She turns off the monitor and kisses him.)
FORREST: You're the one person on this ship that I don't mind giving in
to.
HOSHI: And probably the only one who doesn't want to slip a knife in
your back. I heard the battle went well at Tau Ceti.
FORREST: Is that what you heard?
HOSHI: Word on the ship is the war may be over soon. I'll go back to
Brazil, start teaching again. You'll accept a comfortable desk job at
Headquarters. We'll have the weekends.
FORREST: You've been listening to propaganda. Things went badly at Tau
Ceti. Very badly. We lost twelve ships. Keep this to yourself. If the
crew learns what really happened
HOSHI: Forget about the war. This is our time.
[Outside Turbolift]
(Forrest's bodyguard opens the door to reveal Reed
and a female MACO. The Bodyguard is shot, Forrest reaches for his
weapon but Archer and MACO Travis (complete with earring) comes from
behind and take it off him.)
ARCHER: Don't!
FORREST: You'll hang for this.
ARCHER: Lock him in the Brig.
REED: Sir, let me take him down to the Cargo bay. I'll finish him
quickly, quietly.
ARCHER: I want him alive.
REED: Still, it'd be tragic if there was an accident on the way to the
Brig.
(Archer slams Reed against the bulkhead.)
ARCHER: If anything happens to Forrest, I'll shoot you myself. Are we
clear, Major?
REED: Perfectly, sir.
[Bridge]
(T'Pol is slouched in the Captain's chair, naked
midriff fully on display and hair down below her shoulders.)
ARCHER: Stand aside, Commander.
T'POL: Where's Captain Forrest? (to Tactical) Contact Security.
(Travis shoots him.)
ARCHER: This is First Officer Archer. In accordance with Starfleet
orders this date
[Forrest's quarters]
(Hoshi is lying in bed, reading.)
ARCHER [OC]: I've relieved Captain Forrest of duty and assumed command
of Enterprise. My orders are to
[Sickbay]
(Phlox is doing a spot of recreational vivisection.)
ARCHER [OC]: Take the ship into Tholian space for a mission of vital
importance to the Empire. I can't reveal the details
of our assignment, but I can tell you this.
[Engineering]
(Tucker has similar scarring to Captain Pike in
Menagerie.)
ARCHER [OC]: If we're successful, Starfleet will crush the rebellion
once and for all.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: No crew in Starfleet has been tested more
in battle. I know I can count on each of you to perform your duty to
the best of your ability. Nothing will impede our march toward victory.
Long live the Empire.
CREW: Long live the Empire.
T'POL: (in his ear) We've received no such communiqués from Starfleet
Command.
ARCHER: It was sent on a private channel.
T'POL: I'd like to see those orders.
ARCHER: All in good time. Alter our heading. Two one five mark
thirteen. Maximum warp.
HELM: Yes, Captain.
ARCHER: (to the female MACO) Corporal, escort Commander T'Pol to Cargo
bay two. You'll find a Suliban cloaking device there. Bring it to
Engineering and help Tucker install it. We're going to need the cloak
to complete this mission.
Enterprise Starlog, Captain Jonathan Archer. The
crew has accepted the change of command without incident. Chief
Engineer Tucker reports we'll have cloaking capability within six
hours.
[Ready room]
(Where the pictures of various Enterprises used to
hang, there are now racks of historic weaponry.)
T'POL: These orders appear to be authentic.
ARCHER: Appear? All I require from you is your loyalty. Do I have it?
T'POL: You are in command.
ARCHER: I'm glad we can agree on something. Do you recognise this?
(holds up a gun) It belonged to Zefram Cochrane. He used it to kill the
first Vulcan who stepped onto Terran soil. I wonder how history would
have played out if Cochrane hadn't turned the tables on your invasion
force. Humans might be your slaves instead of the other way around.
T'POL: I'm not a slave.
ARCHER: You're Vulcan. Never forget that. How long until we cross into
Tholian space?
T'POL: It's likely we already have. They frequently annex systems
outside their core territory.
ARCHER: There's a warp signature encoded on this. Notify me the moment
you find it.
T'POL: If there's nothing further.
ARCHER: There is. I'm promoting you to First Officer.
T'POL: Major Reed's next in line. He won't be pleased.
ARCHER: Reed is a capable soldier, but he has trouble following orders.
And I know he has ambitions of his own.
T'POL: You've made it clear you don't approve of Vulcans.
ARCHER: Maybe this is my way of saying thank you to you and your
people. Without Vulcan technology, the Empire wouldn't be where it is
today. Dismissed.
[Archer's quarters]
ARCHER: Serving as my personal guard will have its
privileges. You'll have your own quarters, better food. You'll accept
orders from me and me alone, is that clear?
TRAVIS: Yes, sir. And Captain, if I may? I'd like to be the first to
congratulate you on a brilliant strategy. I'm certain that in years to
come.
ARCHER: You already have the job, Sergeant. Don't talk yourself out of
it. (A Rottweiler
growls) Don't mind Porthos. He hasn't had his dinner yet. (Doorbell
chimes) Come in. (Hoshi is escorted in.) ARCHER: That'll be all.
(Travis leaves.)
HOSHI: You didn't receive a communiqué from Starfleet. I would have
known if something came through. A mutiny. Didn't think you had it in
you.
ARCHER: I'll take that as a compliment.
HOSHI: Where's Captain Forrest?
ARCHER: He's safe.
HOSHI: How do I know that you didn't push him out of an airlock?
(He shows her Forrest in the Brig, on his desk monitor.)
HOSHI: I want to talk to him.
ARCHER: Not right now. He'll remain alive as long as you don't cause
any trouble. No hidden distress signals to Starfleet. I need you and
your expertise.
HOSHI: Is that all you need? You've never forgiven me for leaving. I'm
sorry if I hurt you.
ARCHER: You saw an opportunity for advancement, and you took it.
HOSHI: Just as you did. You should've been Captain from the moment we
left Spacedock. You've always known that. If it hadn't been for all
those Admirals conspiring behind your back, Enterprise would have been
yours. Tradition says that whatever belonged to the previous Captain is
yours for the taking.
ARCHER: I've never been one to argue with tradition.
(They kiss, and she pulls a knife from the back of her bodice and he takes
it off her, all the time with their lips glued together.)
T'POL [OC]: T'Pol to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Maybe we should keep our relationship on a professional level.
T'POL [OC]: Captain Archer, please respond.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
T'POL [OC]: We're approaching the warp signature.
ARCHER: On my way. I expect you to be in a better mood when I get back.
[Bridge]
REED: Captain on the Bridge.
T'POL: We're closing on target. Twenty thousand kilometres.
REED: There's one biosign aboard. Tholian.
ARCHER: Power the tractor emitters.
REED: He's seen us. He's arming weapons.
ARCHER: Disable his ship. I don't want the pilot injured.
(A barrage of torpedoes hit the blue dart ship.)
REED: Done.
T'POL: There's an overload building in his reactor.
ARCHER: Major!
REED: It wasn't my doing, sir. I targeted his weapons only.
T'POL: I believe the pilot may be attempting to destroy his own ship.
ARCHER: Lock on the transporter. Beam him into the Decon Chamber.
REED: Captain.
(The Tholian ship explodes.)
T'POL: We have the pilot.
ARCHER: Archer to Sickbay. We beamed a Tholian into Decon.
[Sickbay]
ARCHER [OC]: Modify the atmosphere in there. (Phlox leaves his latest primate subject.)
PHLOX: It may take a moment.
Tholians have rather extreme life support requirements. Increasing
temperature to four hundred and eighty Kelvin.
(Noises come over the Decon intercom.)
PHLOX: If you're angry now, just wait.
[Outside Decon]
ARCHER: How is he?
PHLOX: How is it would be more accurate. Tholians possess both male and
female characteristics. Its biosigns, such as they are, appear to be
stable.
ARCHER: Will it understand me?
(Hoshi nods, and Archer peers into the Decon Chamber. He sees nothing,
then suddenly a very red hot alien jumps up into view, startling
everyone.)
ARCHER: I'm Captain Archer. You're on board the Terran flagship,
Enterprise. Answer my questions, or you will be harmed.
HOSHI: It's demanding to be released.
ARCHER: I want to know where you're holding the Terran vessel you
captured.
HOSHI: My people will find your ship and destroy it.
PHLOX: A minor adjustment to life support should make it more
co-operative. Decreasing temperature fifty degrees.
ARCHER: Tell me what I want to know.
HOSHI: Something about your maternal ancestor.
ARCHER: Take it down another fifty.
PHLOX: Its exoskeleton is beginning to fracture.
HOSHI: I agree. I agree. (Archer gestures for the temperature to go up again.)
ARCHER: Go on.
HOSHI: The ship is in the Vintaak system at a facility orbiting the gas
giant.
(A strange noise starts up.)
ARCHER: What the hell is that?
T'POL: A short-range transmission.
REED: A distress signal. You think it has a comm. device in there?
T'POL: Its crystalline structure may act as a natural transmitter.
REED: Sir, I recommend we beam it into space immediately.
ARCHER: No. I need to keep it alive for now, until I can verify what
it's told us. Find some way to knock that thing out.
PHLOX: Yes, Captain.
[Engineering]
(Thick cables lead from the warp drive to the
cloaking device.)
TUCKER: You forget something? Biggs! Get the commander a radiation
meter. You don't want to end up like me, do you? I've absorbed enough
delta rays to guarantee my grandchildren glow in the dark.
T'POL: Flux coupler.
TUCKER: They say for every year you spend next to one of these things,
you lose a decade off your life expectancy. Which means I'll probably
be dead by the end of the week.
T'POL: You should speak to Captain Archer about a promotion.
TUCKER: Well, you're his First Officer. You could talk to him for me.
T'POL: Why would I do that?
TUCKER: I did you a favour once.
T'POL: We agreed never to discuss that.
TUCKER: And I haven't.
T'POL: I'd hardly call it a favour. You enjoyed yourself.
TUCKER: Several times, as I recall. So, how many years is it until your
Pon farr comes around again? (A strange noise starts up.) TUCKER: Where the
hell's that coming from? (An energy pulse goes along a cable to the
cloak.) TUCKER: Pull the matrix converters!
(Too late, it goes bang and throws him to the floor.  A short time later, (Phlox is treating Trip's injuries.)
ARCHER: Can you repair the cloak?
TUCKER: It'll take at least a day.
ARCHER: You have six hours.
REED: There are dozens of EPS feeds on this deck, and the only one that
overloads is the one connected to the cloaking device.
TUCKER: The power surge disabled other systems. Internal sensors are
down, we've lost grav-plating on G deck.
ARCHER: The cloak's your first priority. (to Reed) Someone's
responsible for what happened. Find out who.
TUCKER: My people can investigate this. I don't need his kind crawling
around, pulling relays.
ARCHER: Get the cloak online.
[Brig]
ARCHER: Who sabotaged the cloak?
FORREST: Was something damaged?
ARCHER: I know Admiral Black has an agent on Enterprise. I want the
name.
FORREST: You really think that the Admiral would plant a spy on my ship
and then tell me who it is?
ARCHER: (to Travis) Go to his quarters, search his personal files. Look
for messages from Starfleet.
FORREST: Follow his orders, and you'll be executed as a co-conspirator.
TRAVIS: Aye, Captain. (But to who,, we're not sure.)
(Travis leaves.)
FORREST: This isn't like you, Jonathan. You never lusted for power and
glory. That's why I trusted you at my side for all these years, because
you have no ambition.
(Archer opens the door and walks in, punches him in the kidneys and
throws him against the walls.)
ARCHER: If that's right, then why are you in the Brig?
FORREST: (in a strangle hold) Release me and I promise your death will
be quick. You won't get that guarantee from the Admiral. Kill me and
she'll never forgive you.
[Situation room]
REED: The saboteur entered this junction and
deliberately overloaded this EPS waveguide.
ARCHER: That junction's supposed to be off-limits.
REED: The intruder alarms were disabled.
ARCHER: How?
REED: There's only one way I know of. By running a high-level
diagnostic scan. Commander Tucker initiated a scan thirty minutes
before the overload.
[Agony booth]
ARCHER: Who ordered you to sabotage the cloak?
TUCKER: I didn't! (Reed is at the controls and enjoying himself.)
TUCKER: Reed, I'll kill you when I get out of this!
REED: I'd like to see you try.
ARCHER: I checked the records. Admiral Black recommended you for Chief
Engineer. He insisted Forrest replace his own man with you. You're
working for the Admiral, aren't you? What have you told him?
TUCKER: Captain, you've got it all wrong. It wasn't me!
ARCHER: What have you told him?
TUCKER: Please, Captain. I've always been loyal to you!
ARCHER: Break him.
[Archer's quarters]
(Hoshi and Archer are in bed together.)
HOSHI: It hasn't been that good in a long time. The things a girl will
give up for her career.
ARCHER: The data I gave you. Did you transmit it to the Fleet Admiral?
HOSHI: Of course. What was it?
ARCHER: Insurance policy.
(He sits up.)
HOSHI: What's wrong?
ARCHER: Tucker's a competent engineer. If he wanted to damage the
cloak, he could have done a much better job.
HOSHI: Well, it couldn't have been easy with T'Pol looking over his
shoulder.
ARCHER: Computer, locate Commander T'Pol.
COMPUTER: (male) Unable to comply. Internal sensors are offline.
ARCHER: The sensors were damaged by the overload.
HOSHI: What's going on?
ARCHER: Stay here.
[Brig]
(T'Pol and her Vulcan allies stage a jail break
just as Archer gets there. There's a gunfight in the corridor, then
Archer ducks into a turbolift.)
FORREST: I wondered what was keeping you.
T'POL: I needed time to find help.
FORREST: No alarm?
T'POL: I've disabled the internal sensors and the comm. system.
FORREST: We'll take the Bridge first.
[Bridge]
(They shoot the duty officer and the helm officer.)
FORREST: Set a course out of Tholian space, maximum warp.
T'POL: I can't alter our heading.
FORREST: Full stop!
T'POL: The helm's not responding.
(The turbolift door opens, and Archer is there, empty-handed.)
ARCHER: Having trouble?
FORREST: You did this.
ARCHER: Autonavigation can't be released until we've reach the
coordinates I've set.
FORREST: Restore the controls now.
ARCHER: I can't. They've been encrypted with a random code.
FORREST: Can you override the helm?
T'POL: It'll take several days to break the encryption.
ARCHER: We'll arrive at the co-ordinates long before then.
(sarcastically) The Bridge is yours, Captain.
[Agony booth]
PHLOX: Ten hours in the Booth. Impressive.
FORREST: Get him out of there.
(Archer falls out of the perspex tube.)
FORREST: Bring Major Reed. I want him to spend some time in this
invention of his.
ARCHER: You going to shoot me now or wait for court-martial?
FORREST: Fleet Admiral Gardner's ordered you released. He received the
data you sent him. The Admiral finds your suggestion intriguing. Since
you've already locked us on this course, I've been ordered to
investigate your mystery ship. You betrayed me. Don't think for one
moment I'm going to forget that. Get cleaned up. You're briefing the
senior staff in an hour.
[Conference room]
T'POL: A parallel universe? The Science Directorate
has examined all of these theories. They've found no evidence of
alternate realities.
ARCHER: The Tholians are a little more open-minded than your people.
They detonated a tricobalt warhead here, inside the gravity well of a
dead star. The explosion created an interphasic rift. A doorway into
another universe.
TUCKER: A doorway.
ARCHER: The rift was unstable. It was too dangerous to send one of
their own ships through, so they transmitted a distress call into the
opening, hoping to lure a ship from the other side. Their plan worked
brilliantly.
HOSHI: How did you learn all this?
ARCHER: The Tholians rely on outside labourers. Humanoids. Some of them
can be bought for the right price.
TUCKER: I hope you didn't pay too much.
ARCHER: My contact transmitted these images before his signal was
jammed.
TUCKER: You can barely see anything.
ARCHER: Computer, enhance grid three alpha.
(Just sticking out of the moon is the saucer section of NCC1764.)
FORREST: An Earth ship?
ARCHER: According to some theories, everything that exists in our
universe should also exist there.
HOSHI: Another Terran Empire? Another Starfleet?
TUCKER: So what? How does this help us?
ARCHER: The Tholians quantum-dated a piece of the hull. This ship is
not only from another universe, it's from another time. About a hundred
years into the future. Imagine the technology we can find on that ship.
New tactical systems, advanced bio-weapons. Engines that can reach
speeds we can only dream of. All of it ours for the taking!
T'POL: This is ludicrous, Captain. Someone has fabricated this evidence
to lure us here. Commander Archer is guilty of assault and mutiny.
FORREST: That's enough, Commander.
T'POL: Sir, I believe we should send
FORREST: I said shut up! We're investigating this. Get that cloaking
device working.
[Engineering]
T'POL: The Captain wants a progress report.
TUCKER: I'll need another minute to calibrate the field converters. I
spent four hours in the Booth because of you.
T'POL: Perhaps you should direct your anger at Commander Archer.
TUCKER: You disabled the alarms in that junction and made it look like
I did it.
T'POL: You're mistaken.
TUCKER: The hell I am! I think I'd remember if I had sabotaged the
ship!
T'POL: Not necessarily.
TUCKER: What did you do to me?
T'POL: I lured you away from Engineering with the promise of a sexual
encounter.
[T'Pol's quarters - memory]
T'POL: My mind to your mind.
T'POL [OC]: Once we were alone in my quarters, I implanted a telepathic
suggestion.
T'POL: My thoughts to your thoughts.
T'POL [OC]: I compelled you to sabotage the power grid.
[Engineering]
T'POL: After you completed the assignment, we
melded again. I altered your memory of what had happened. It was my
duty to help Captain Forrest regain command.
TUCKER: You're going to regret what you did.
T'POL: Threats are illogical.
TUCKER: Engineering to Bridge!
FORREST [OC]: Go ahead.
TUCKER: We're ready.
[Bridge]
TUCKER [OC]: I'm going to have to channel
everything except auxiliary power.
FORREST: Engage the cloak.
(Enterprise shimmers out of sight and continues on its journey.)
T'POL: We've reached the coordinates. Autonavigation has disengaged.
FORREST: Let's see where we are.
(It's an aqua-coloured gas giant with rings and moons.)
ARCHER: Magnify the moon on the far right.
(There's the ship from the briefing - TOS era design, USS Defiant.)
[Situation room]
T'POL: Primary systems are offline, including life
support. We're reading thirteen biosigns, all alien. One of them
appears to be reptilian. They're clustered in this section.
(She indicates the area where the nacelles join the lower decks.)
ARCHER: Any sign of the crew?
T'POL: We've detected no human signatures.
REED: It's likely the crew was executed.
TUCKER: Look at the size of those coils. I'll bet that thing could do
warp seven.
FORREST: We'll send an assault team aboard. You brought us here, you
lead it. Download whatever you can from the database, then destroy the
ship.
ARCHER: Destroy it? We have to take the ship with us.
FORREST: It's too dangerous. We are deep in Tholian space.
ARCHER: Sir, you can't do this.
FORREST: You have your orders! Dismissed.
(Archer, Reed and Tucker leave.)
FORREST: (to T'Pol) Go with him. I don't want Archer to return from
this mission. Do I make myself clear, Commander?
[USS Defiant]
(Five figures in EV suits beam aboard.)
T'POL: Someone's removed these components.
ARCHER: They're gutting the ship.
(They come across a figure in a red shirt lying on a corridor floor.)
T'POL: Human.
(Archer rolls him over. Ensign Ricky has a big hole in his chest.
Archer picks up his phaser.)
REED: If you'd like, sir, I could hold that for you.
(So Archer puts it in his belt.)
[Decon Chamber]
(The Tholian has started making noises again.)
PHLOX: Nap time isn't over yet.
(But this time he can't stop the signal.)
[Bridge]
HOSHI: I'm picking up a transmission. It's coming
from Decon.
FORREST: Bridge to Phlox.
[Decon Chamber]
FORREST [OC]: What's happening down there?
PHLOX: The sedative is no longer working.
FORREST [OC]: Well then kill it, now!
PHLOX: With pleasure.
[Bridge]
HOSHI: Three ships are moving toward our position.
FORREST: Doctor?
[Decon chamber]
PHLOX: A few more seconds, Captain. Will you kindly
die?
(The six legged Tholian finally explodes.)
PHLOX: Phlox to Bridge.
[Bridge]
PHLOX [OC]: You won't be having any further trouble
from our guest.
HOSHI: One of the Tholian ships is hailing us.
[USS Defiant - Bridge]
ARCHER: This must be the Captain.
T'POL: His neck's broken.
TUCKER: (at the science station) We should be able to overload the
reactor from here.
ARCHER: Get started.
[Bridge]
HOSHI: Four more ships.
FORREST: Contact Archer. Tell him to abort the mission. Lay in a course
out of here.
HOSHI: They're jamming us.
(The Tholian ships start to create their web around Enterprise.)
FORREST: Target the nearest ship. Fire!
HOSHI: No damage.
FORREST: Torpedo launchers, fire when ready.
(The torpedoes light up the web, and Enterprise becomes visible. The
Tholians start firing at them.)
HOSHI: They can see us.
(Things start to go bang)
FORREST: Get us out of here. Engineering, disengage the cloak and
transfer all power to engines.
CREWMAN [OC]: The cloak's not responding, sir.
[USS Defiant - Bridge]
ARCHER: How much longer?
TUCKER: Maybe you'd like to take a stab at it.
T'POL: I can activate their systems.
ARCHER: Stand aside, Commander.
TUCKER: Almost there.
(Lights come on, panels activate, and from outside we see the nacelles
start to spin up.)
T'POL: Enterprise is under attack.
[Bridge]
HOSHI: Hull plating's down. We've lost power on
decks C, D and E.
CREWMAN [OC]: Engineering to Bridge. The containment fields are
failing.
FORREST: Can you vent the antimatter?
CREWMAN [OC]: Negative. Reactor breach in three minutes.
FORREST: This is the Captain. All hands to escape pods. Abandon ship.
You heard my order!
HOSHI: What do you think you're doing?
FORREST: I'll buy you as much time as I can. Get out of here, now.
[USS Defiant - Bridge]
(The away team have taken their helmets off.)
T'POL: Enterprise is taking heavy damage.
ARCHER: Can you bring weapons and engines online?
TUCKER: I'll see what I can do.
ARCHER: (referring to the bodies on the floor) Give me a hand with
them!
(Meanwhile, the Enterprise escape pods are being picked off one by one.
Forrest is at helm, the doing a Janeway impression.)
T'POL: Commander.
(They all look at the viewscreen, as Enterprise explodes inside the
Tholian Web.)

In A
Mirror, Darkly - part 2
 Original Airdate: 29 Apr, 2005
  ARCHER:
Previously, on Enterprise. 
T'POL [Conference
room]: A parallel universe.
ARCHER: According to some theories, everything that exists in our
universe should also exist there.
HOSHI: Another Terran Empire, another Starfleet?
T'POL [Ready room]: I am
not a slave.
ARCHER: You're Vulcan. Never forget that.
HOSHI [Archer's quarters]: (in
bed with Archer) The things a girl will give up for her career.
ARCHER [Conference room]: This
ship is not only from another universe, it's from another time. About a
hundred years into the future. Imagine the technology we can find on
that ship. Ours for the taking.
T'POL [USS Defiant - Bridge]:
Enterprise is under attack.
HOSHI [Bridge]:
The Tholians can see us!
FORREST: This is the Captain. All hands to escape pods. Abandon ship!
[USS Defiant - Bridge]
(Enterprise has just been destroyed by the
Tholians.)
ARCHER: Commander!
TUCKER: You've got thrusters.
ARCHER: Release the docking clamps.
T'POL: I can't.
ARCHER: What about weapons?
TUCKER: This power grid's a mess! It's going to take a few minutes.
REED: Sir, the shields are functional.
ARCHER: Raise them.
REED: Our shields are weakening the clamps, but they're still holding.
ARCHER: I'll alternate port and starboard thrusters. That should shake
them loose.
T'POL: We're free.
ARCHER: Firing aft thrusters.
T'POL: Six Tholian ships moving toward us.
ARCHER: How much longer for weapons?
TUCKER: The power couplings have been removed. I don't know if I can
bypass them.
TRAVIS: Sir.
(Archer turns to the viewscreen, to see another Web being constructed.)
ARCHER: Mister Tucker.
TUCKER: Stand by. I could use some help over here. (T'Pol runs over)
When I tell you, shunt the plasma to the forward emitters.
REED: Three more ships approaching.
TUCKER: Just a few more seconds!
(There's a jolt.)
ARCHER: What was that?
REED: They've locked on a tractor beam. We're being pulled back into
the dock.
ARCHER: It's now or never!
TUCKER: Stand by! Now.
T'POL: Tactical systems are online.
(Reed fires phasers to destroy the tractor emitter, then blows up three
of the Tholian ships, wrecking the web.)
ARCHER: Full thrusters.
REED: The remaining ships are retreating.
T'POL: The station's opened fire.
ARCHER: Does this thing have aft torpedoes?
TUCKER: You better believe it. They're armed.
(A salvo destroys the station.)
REED: Escape pods. Twelve kilometres off the port bow. They're ours.
ARCHER: Bring them onboard.
[Briefing room]
ARCHER: We need warp drive.
TUCKER: Engineering's been stripped to the bulkheads. But the good news
is, most of what they took was still sitting in my hangar deck. But I
need time to figure out how to put it all back together.
T'POL: How much time?
TUCKER: Two or three days. Sir, I'm not even sure what some of these
systems are supposed to do. It's like I'm Chief Engineer on a steamship
coming aboard the first interplanetary transport.
ARCHER: If we don't have warp capability in twelve hours, I'm going to
find a new Chief Engineer.
T'POL: I suggest we make use of the alien workers. They may know
something about these systems.
ARCHER: Keep them under close surveillance. Once warp drive is
restored, we'll set a course to rendezvous with the assault fleet.
T'POL: We're in no condition for battle.
REED: We made quick work of the Tholians.
T'POL: This ship is designed to be operated by a crew of four hundred.
There are only forty seven of us. The logical course of action is to
take Defiant to Earth, allow Starfleet to study it, reverse-engineer
its systems.
ARCHER: There's no time! The Empire could lose this war in a matter
weeks if we don't get the Defiant and its weapons to the front lines.
Dismissed! Commander. (grabs T'Pol's arm) Not you.
(The rest of the senior staff leave, and Archer takes Travis' weapon.)
ARCHER: I should shoot you for betraying me.
T'POL: The orders giving you command of Enterprise were obviously
fabricated. It was my duty as a Starfleet officer to help Captain
Forrest regain control of his ship.
ARCHER: You swore your loyalty to me.
T'POL: You should be aware Captain Forrest ordered me to kill you.
ARCHER: Why are you telling me this?
T'POL: Forrest is dead. His orders are no longer valid. You are my
commanding officer.
ARCHER: I never had a problem with your people until they became a part
of this rebellion. If I had another officer capable of doing your job,
I'd show you to the nearest airlock. I need you to get this ship up and
running. But if I hear so much as a rumour that you're working behind
my back
T'POL: Understood.
ARCHER: Get out.
[Captain's quarters]
HOSHI: What are you wearing?
(Archer is in a green top with gold braid.)
ARCHER:
I found it in the Captain's wardrobe.
HOSHI: These people had some strange ideas about uniforms.
ARCHER: I can't find a mention of it anywhere.
HOSHI: A mention of what?
ARCHER: The Empire. As far as I can tell, it doesn't exist in the other
universe.
HOSHI: No Empire?
ARCHER: A lot of the names are the same, but their history has been
rewritten. Instead of building an empire, Earth became part of an
interspecies alliance.
HOSHI: (reading the desk monitor) The United Federation of Planets?
ARCHER: More like a Federation of Fools.
HOSHI: What about us? Do we exist in this universe?
ARCHER: Computer, access biographical file, Starfleet Officer Hoshi
Sato.
COMPUTER: Working.
(Everyone say Hi! to Majel Barrett Roddenberry's voice, in its
only appearance in this series.)
ARCHER: (reading) Hoshi Sato. Comm. Officer on Starfleet's first warp
five ship. In her late thirties, she created the linguacode translation
matrix.
HOSHI: At least she was remembered for something.
ARCHER: I can tell you who she married. It even says how you died.
HOSHI: Stop. I don't want to know.
ARCHER: But this isn't you.
HOSHI: I don't care. Computer. Display file on Starfleet Officer
Jonathan Archer.
COMPUTER: Working.
HOSHI: Son of famed warp specialist Henry Archer, Jonathan was
appointed Captain of Starfleet's first warp five ship. His name is
among the most recognised in the Federation. He earned an impressive
list of commendations during his career. Historians called him the
greatest explorer of the twenty second century. Two planets were named
after him.
(Archer switches it off with his fist.)
HOSHI: Hey.
ARCHER: There's nothing great about that man. He sold out Earth's
future to a group of subhuman species. Great men are not peacemakers.
Great men are conquerors.
HOSHI: Forget about him. Your future is just beginning. Can you imagine
the look on the Emperor's face when he sees this ship? You'll be
declared Hero of the Empire. Starfleet'll have to give you a command of
your own.
ARCHER: I already have a command of my own.
[Jefferies tube]
TUCKER: (in Engineering red) What's the problem?
KELBY: Commander. Somebody pulled both plasma regulators out of these
housings.
TUCKER: Why are you bothering me with this? They're probably on the
hangar deck.
KELBY: No, sir, you don't understand. They were here ten minutes ago. I
went to get this coupler. When I came back, the regulators were gone.
TUCKER: You'd better find them, because if this junction's not on line
in ten minutes, I'm going to tell Archer you're the reason we don't
have warp drive.
KELBY: Yes. Yes, sir.
(There's a strange noise, so Kelby climbs up into a junction to
investigate.)
KELBY: Who's in here?
(He finds one of the regulators on the floor, picks it up, then we see
him being dragged upwards. Screaming.)
[Bridge]
(All except Phlox are now in TOS era uniforms. Yes,
T'Pol is in a blue mini-skort, and I did spell that correctly. It is a
combination mini-skirt and hot pants, for modesty.)
PHLOX: I found traces of reptilian saliva in the Ensign's wounds.
ARCHER: Something bit him?
PHLOX: The bite radius would suggest a particularly large reptile, more
than two metres in length.
ARCHER: Can you find this thing on internal sensors?
T'POL: It's not in the primary hull. Sensors are still offline on the
Engineering decks.
REED: Perhaps it was a pet owned by one of the original crew.
PHLOX: Unless one of them owned a velociraptor, I find it extremely
unlikely.
TUCKER: (entering) There's no sign of the regulators. Without them, we
can't initialise the reaction chamber. We're stuck at impulse.
T'POL: Whoever sabotaged us knew exactly which components to steal.
ARCHER: The slaves we captured, bring one of them to the Briefing Room.
REED: Certainly, sir.
[Briefing room]
(Travis is interrogating an unfamiliar blue-skinned
alien with his fists.)
ARCHER: What attacked my crewman?
ALIEN: He promised he'd kill us if we told you.
ARCHER: I'll kill you now if you don't.
ALIEN: Please!
ARCHER: Stand aside.
(He draws his phaser.)
T'POL: T'Pol to Major Reed. Bring another prisoner to the Briefing
Room.
REED [OC]: Acknowledged.
ARCHER: From what I'm told, the maximum setting can actually
disintegrate a person. I've been looking forward to trying it.
ALIEN: His name is Slar.
ARCHER: Who's name?
ALIEN: Our slave master. He was in charge of the salvage operation.
When you boarded the ship, he hid in the service crawlways. He was
planning to sabotage the ship.
ARCHER: Where in the crawlways?
ALIEN: Possibly near the power transfer conduits on deck twenty two.
It's warm there. His species likes it warm.
ARCHER: What species?
ALIEN: Gorn. He's he's a Gorn.
[Bridge]
(A schematic of Defiant is up on the viewscreen.)
REED: We had it cornered in turboshaft three but it appears to have
escaped through this access tube. That's when we lost contact with
McKenzie and Browne.
ARCHER: (not the real one, his subconscious) They're taking too long.
When my ship was in jeopardy, I didn't let Security handle the
situation. I took care of it myself.
ARCHER: (the real one) I'd have better luck sending a squad of
Tellarites to capture this thing. Put an assault team together. I'll
lead it myself.
HOSHI: (not in TOS-era uniform) Sir, I'm picking up a signal from
inside the ship. I think it's the reptile.
ARCHER: Can you pinpoint its location?
HOSHI: The frequency's scrambled.
ARCHER: I want to talk to it.
HOSHI: The translator matrix is tied in.
ARCHER: This is Captain Archer. Return our plasma regulators now.
SLAR [OC]: I want to leave this ship.
ARCHER: Give me what I want, and we'll talk.
SLAR [OC]: No. I'm familiar with your species. Humans are not
trustworthy.
[Access tube]
(A CGI dinosaur-style Gorn, not a man in a rubber
suit.)
SLAR: You will give me a shuttlecraft. Once I'm away from this ship
[Bridge]
SLAR [OC]: I'll tell you where to find the
regulators.
ARCHER: This is not a negotiation! The regulators, now! If you don't
comply, I'll give the order
HOSHI: He closed the channel.
ARCHER: Major, get the team together. Your best men.
T'POL: The Gorn's offer is reasonable.
ARCHER: He has no intention of returning the regulators. If we give him
a shuttle, he'll contact his people and come back here with a warship.
Without warp drive, we'll be an easy target.
[Turbolift]
ARCHER: (his subconscious whispers in his ear)
Defeat this Gorn and you'll finally earn the respect you deserve.
[Access tube]
REED: There's a biosign, very faint, in access tube
seven alpha near junction three.
ARCHER: I'll seal off the bulkhead here. That'll leave him with only
one escape route. Flush him out, drive him into this junction. I'll be
waiting for him.
REED: Understood.
(Reed and two MACO head one way, Archer and the other MACO another.
Reed thinks he's found his prey, but Slar has just left his
communicator open on the floor.)
REED: Reed to Captain Archer.
ARCHER [OC]: Go ahead.
REED: It's not here.
REED [OC]: He's modified a communicator to emit a false biosign.
ARCHER: Meet us in Junction Three.
REED [OC]: Acknowledged.
REED: Shut that bloody thing off.
(The MACO does so, and Reed spots a bunch of red flashing lights on the
ceiling. As the bomb goes off -)
REED:
It's a trap!
(Archer and his escort arrive at the bloody and burning scene.)
REED: (before passing out) I've failed you, Captain.
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol. Where is it?
T'POL [OC]: The Gorn's moved into the primary hull.
[Bridge]
T'POL: It's on Deck Nine.
[Access tube]
ARCHER: We're going to Plan B. Access the
environmental controls on that deck. Wait for my signal.
[Bridge]
T'POL: Acknowledged.
[Deck 9]
(Slar watches as Archer makes his way along the
corridor, stepping over bodies. Then he drops on him and they fight.
Archer is injured, and the MACO hits Slar over the head with his weapon
until the Gorn comes after him instead.)
ARCHER: Archer to T'Pol. Section four A, on my mark.
T'POL [OC]: Standing by.
ARCHER: Now!
[Bridge]
T'POL: Enhancing grav-plating.
[Deck 9]
(Slar is dragged to the floor.)
T'POL [OC]: Grav-plating's at twenty G's.
(Two more MACO turn up.)
ARCHER: Give me your weapon.
(He fires at Slar six times, to make sure.)
Defiant Starlog, January 18, 2155. We've recovered
the missing engine components and I've ordered a course to rendezvous
with the assault fleet.
[Recreation room]
(Complete with 3D chess set.)
T'POL: What's Major Reed's condition?
PHLOX: At this point, he could go either way. No doubt there'll be
several discreet celebrations if he should expire.
T'POL: I notice you've been making extensive use of the library
database.
PHLOX: I was merely researching classical literature. I wanted to
compare our major works with their counterparts in the other universe.
I skimmed a few of the more celebrated narratives. The stories were
similar in some respects, but their characters were weak and
compassionate. With the exception of Shakespeare, of course. From what
I could tell, his plays were equally grim in both universes.
T'POL: Examine their historical files. You may want to learn more about
their Federation. Did you know in the other universe, humans and
Denobulans are considered equals? As are Vulcans. You don't find this
interesting.
PHLOX: I find it dangerous. If I were the Captain, I'd restrict access
to that database. I'm certain he wouldn't want to give his crew any
ideas.
T'POL: Perhaps you should reconsider the repercussions
(Alarm sounds.)
ARCHER [OC]: This is the Captain. All hands to battle stations.
[ISS Avenger - Bridge]
(Rebel ships are firing on an Empire ship. They are
taking casualties.)
BLACK: Report!
SOVAL: (with goatee beard) Hull breach on B deck. Emergency bulkheads
are engaged.
BLACK: Concentrate your fire on the Andorians.
SOVAL: Hull plating's at thirty two percent. Admiral, there's another
vessel approaching.
BLACK: More rebels?
SOVAL: No.
[Bridge]
(Defiant blows the rebels to pieces.)
TRAVIS: Direct hits.
HOSHI: The Tellarite ship's opened fire. No damage.
ARCHER: Lock on their reactor. Fire when ready.
TRAVIS: Target destroyed.
HOSHI: The Vulcan ship's trying to escape.
ARCHER: Pursuit course.
T'POL: Captain, they're no threat to us. I recommend we
ARCHER: Fire when ready.
(Four torpedoes dispose of the elegant curved ship.)
HOSHI: The last Andorian ship is retreating.
TRAVIS: Weapons are locked.
ARCHER: No. Let them go. I want the other rebels to know what happened
here. Get me Admiral Black.
BLACK [on viewscreen]: Archer?
ARCHER: Sorry we're late for the party, Admiral.
BLACK [on viewscreen]: Where's Enterprise? Is Captain Forrest with you?
ARCHER: It's going to take some time to explain, sir. Perhaps you'd
like to see the Defiant for yourself.
[Briefing room]
BLACK: A most impressive vessel, Commander. With
the technology on this ship at our disposal, the rebels won't stand a
chance.
ARCHER: Glad you agree, sir.
BLACK: I intend to recommend that you get your own command at the
earliest opportunity.
ARCHER: Respectfully, sir, you have the authority to grant a
battlefield promotion.
BLACK: Unfortunately, we don't have a ship to give you at the moment.
ARCHER: The Defiant.
BLACK: I'm sure the Fleet Admiral has other plans for this ship
ARCHER: (his subconscious again) They're never going to give you this
ship, you know that. They'll tear it apart, try to learn its secrets.
If you're lucky, you'll end up commanding a moon shuttle. Don't you see
what the Admiral's planning? He's going to present this ship to the
Emperor himself. He'll take all the credit, and you'll end up a
historical footnote.
BLACK: (mostly under the above speech) Once we reach Earth, we'll
disassemble its tactical systems. Our experts will want to examine
(inaudible) With any luck, we should be able to replicate the phase
cannons and upgrade (something) The rebels won't know what hit them.
What you've accomplished could alter the course of the war. The people
of the Earth are in your debt, Commander.
ARCHER: That's Captain. You're relieved, Admiral.
(Travis takes out Black's bodyguard, and Archer phasers the Admiral out
of existence.)
[ISS Avenger - Shuttlebay]
(The two crews are assembled for a speech from
their new Captain.)
ARCHER: Our entire assault fleet wiped out by a rebel attack. Thousands
of your fellow Starfleet officers dead. If the Defiant hadn't arrived
when it did, all of you would be among them. And who are we to blame
for this? Not the brave men and women who gave their lives for the
Empire. The criminals who are losing this war are sitting in their
comfortable offices back at Starfleet Command. Their weakness invited
our enemies to strike, and their corruption and arrogance have brought
the Empire to the brink of defeat! I've been a soldier all my life, and
I will not stand by and let these people destroy an empire that has
endured for centuries! I ask you, all of you to join me. We cannot put
down this rebellion so long as our forces are commanded by
dishonourable men. Before we can defeat the rebels, we must defeat
them. That ship out there is the key to our victory. With the Defiant
on our side, there will be nothing to stop us. [Deleted
scene]
ARCHER With your help, I will return to Earth and restore the Empire to
its former glory. Let us advance where the omens of the gods and the
crimes of our enemies summon us! The die is now cast! Long live the
Empire!
ALL: Long live the Empire! (round of applause)
ARCHER: (to Travis before leaving) Shoot the first one who stops
applauding.
[Soval's quarters]
SOVAL: Enter.
(T'Pol enters, and raises her hand in the traditional Vulcan greeting.)
SOVAL: It's not wise to make that gesture, even behind closed doors. It
is agreeable to see you again.
T'POL: Did you review the historical files?
SOVAL: The implications are intriguing.
T'POL: Intriguing?
SOVAL: This alternate universe is very different from ours. I'm not
certain a Federation could ever exist here.
T'POL: I thought you were an idealist.
SOVAL: That was many years ago.
T'POL: We have to take action. Archer intends to overthrow Starfleet
and the Emperor.
SOVAL; Archer is right. The Empire has become corrupt. A new leader may
change things for the better.
T'POL: Not for our people. The weapons on that ship will annihilate the
rebels, including thousands of Vulcans. We can give them an advantage.
SOVAL: How?
T'POL: I can download the data on Defiant's engines and tactical
systems. We'll give it to them.
SOVAL: Data will be of little value. Archer still controls that ship.
T'POL: I'm going to destroy that ship.
SOVAL: What?
T'POL: I can disable Defiant's power systems, but I'll need your help.
Do you want to spend the rest of your life serving the Empire?
SOVAL: I'm too old to become a revolutionary.
T'POL: I know Archer. He blames our people for inciting the rebels. If
he becomes Emperor, he'll lay waste to Vulcan. I can't do this without
you.
[USS Defiant - Captain's quarters]
(Night. Archer is sitting on the end of the bed
when Hoshi wakes, and starts caressing and kissing him.)
ARCHER: My senior officers don't think I can do this.
HOSHI: They'll come around.
ARCHER: T'Pol doesn't approve, either. I can see it in her eyes.
HOSHI: Maybe it's time to get rid of her, now that this ship's
operational.
ARCHER: Not just her. We'll get rid of all the non-Terrans. I'll
transfer them off Defiant.
HOSHI: All of them?
ARCHER: The rebels have spies everywhere. I can't afford to have a
single alien aboard my flagship.
HOSHI: I hope you're not planning on getting sick anytime soon. In case
you haven't noticed, your doctor is an alien.
ARCHER: I've got nothing against Phlox. His people aren't rebels. It's
not in their nature. He can stay.
HOSHI: I've never been the consort of an Emperor before. Is there
anything I need to know?
ARCHER: I think you, I think you've got the basics down.
[Bridge]
(T'Pol is copying files when Archer comes on deck.)
ARCHER: Put me through to Fleet Admiral Gardner. Corporal. Escort
Commander T'Pol to Transporter Room Two. Your service aboard this ship
is no longer required.
(Travis removes her dagger and phaser.)
GARDNER [on viewscreen]: Archer. What the hell is going on?
ARCHER: I take it you received my message.
GARDNER [on viewscreen]: You demanded Starfleet's unconditional
surrender! Have you lost your mind?
ARCHER: You've seen the specs on the Defiant. You know what its weapons
can do.
GARDNER [on viewscreen]: I want to speak with Admiral Black.
ARCHER: He's not available right now. I suggest you order your forces
to stand down. Starfleet can't afford to lose any more ships.
GARDNER [on viewscreen]: This is your only warning, Commander. Do not
approach Earth or you will be fired upon!
[Corridor]
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Bridge to Doctor Phlox.
PHLOX: This is Phlox.
CREWWOMAN [OC]: There's a medical emergency on the Avenger. You're
needed immediately.
PHLOX: Acknowledged.
[ISS Avenger - Corridor]
(Phlox meets Soval and T'Pol.)
PHLOX: Neither of you appears to be injured.
[ISS Avenger - Shuttlebay]
PHLOX; Sabotage the Defiant? Have you lost your
senses?
SOVAL: You're the only non-Terran on the Defiant. Any of us would
arouse suspicion.
T'POL: You heard Archer's speech. He's delusional.
PHLOX: It's not a delusion if the Captain has the power to do what he
says. And from what I've seen, he most certainly does. I should report
you both.
SOVAL: Are you loyal to the Empire or not?
PHLOX: Of course I am!
T'POL: Archer plans to kill the Emperor and take his place.
PHLOX: The Captain has proven himself in battle. Perhaps he should rule
the Empire.
SOVAL: If Archer fails, his crew will have to answer for his crimes.
T'POL: We'll be executed. There's an old tradition. If someone saves
the Emperor's life, it's said there's no request he can refuse them.
Consider the possibilities.
A medical facility of your own with unlimited resources. You could
conduct experiments as you see fit.
SOVAL: Don't forget the females.
PHLOX: Females?
SOVAL: You'll be able to choose as many concubines as you'd like.
PHLOX: If the Emperor were my patient, I'd be obligated to save his
life. I suppose what you're suggesting isn't that different.
[ISS Avenger - Corridor]
(T'Pol calls for a turbolift, the door opens and
she is confronted by Hoshi and a MACO pointing guns at her.)
T'POL: What's this?
HOSHI: Save it, Commander. The schematics you downloaded. Where are
they?
T'POL: Schematics?
(The MACO disarms her.)
HOSHI: Let's go.
(T'Pol knocks down the MACO, but gets cut by Hoshi.)
HOSHI: I was hoping you'd put up a fight.
T'POL: I'm surprised you're not exhausted from all the beds you've
jumped into recently.
HOSHI: Commander Tucker told me I should give you a few pointers in
that area.
(T'Pol knocks her down and makes her escape, but the MACO recovers
enough to shoot her in the back.)
HOSHI: Bring her.
[USS Defiant]
(Phlox makes his way up a Jefferies tube.)
[ISS Avenger - Bridge]
(An Andorian hauls a dead human out of the helm
chair.)
SOVAL: Shut down the turbolifts. (to an Orion woman) Secure the Bridge.
[Briefing room]
ARCHER: Who are you working with? I hope you're
prepared to die.
T'POL: My death will change nothing. You will not prevail.
ARCHER: The Defiant will prevail. It's simply a matter of firepower.
T'POL: The Federation is our future.
ARCHER: You're mistaking our universe for someone else's.
T'POL: It may take centuries, but humanity will pay for its arrogance.
[USS Defiant]
(Phlox is about to do his sabotage when his
communicator beeps.)
PHLOX: These interruptions aren't helping.
SOVAL [OC]: I need an estimate.
PHLOX: The inside of this panel
[ISS Avenger - Bridge]
PHLOX [OC]: Doesn't look anything like the
schematic you gave me.
SOVAL: You need to remove the duotronic module.
[USS Defiant]
SOVAL [OC]: The relays are behind it.
PHLOX: I've removed the module.
[ISS Avenger - Bridge]
SOVAL: You have to disengage the flow regulators
before you remove the relays
[USS Defiant]
SOVAL [OC]: Or the plasma will ignite.
[ISS Avenger - Bridge]
SOVAL: Someone's trying to override the Bridge
lockouts. Doctor, you must hurry!
[USS Defiant - Bridge]
TRAVIS: The warp field's fluctuating.
TUCKER: It's a power drain. Primary EPS relays.
TRAVIS: I'll alert the Captain.
TUCKER: No. It's probably just a micro-fracture in the conduit. Do you
really want to interrupt the Captain for that? I'll handle it. (to
crewman) Take over.
CREWMAN: Yes, sir.
[Briefing room]
ARCHER: (to a MACO) Take a team aboard Avenger.
Confine every alien on that ship.
HOSHI: There's no point in continuing. She's not going to talk. We
should kill her.
ARCHER: You've been looking forward to that for a while, haven't you?
(There's a jolt as Phlox removes the flow regulators.)
ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge. Report!
TRAVIS: Main power's offline. We've dropped out of warp.
[ISS Avenger - Bridge]
SOVAL: Close to ten thousand metres. Target their
primary hull.
(A barrage of torpedoes set off explosions.)
[USS Defiant]
 PHLOX: Phlox to Soval. I'm finished here. Stand by
to transport.
(But he gets jumped by Tucker instead.)
TUCKER: What the hell have you done?
(They wrestle.)
[Bridge]
ARCHER: I need weapons!
TRAVIS: Everything's offline.
[ISS Avenger - Bridge]
SOVAL: Continue firing.
[USS Defiant]
(Tucker knocks out Phlox and puts the flow
regulators back.)
[Bridge]
(Archer has his head down as if he's crying.)
TRAVIS: Primary systems are coming back. We have shields.
ARCHER: Raise them!
[ISS Avenger - Bridge]
SOVAL: Soval to Phlox.
[USS Defiant]
SOVAL [OC]: Their power grid's being restored.
What's happening? Doctor? Respond!
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: Weapons are online.
ARCHER: Destroy them!
[ISS Avenger - Bridge]
SOVAL: Get us out of their weapons range! Divert
all power to hull plating!
[Bridge]
HOSHI: They've taken heavy damage.
TRAVIS: They're trying to escape.
ARCHER: Photon torpedoes. Lock on to their reactor.
(And the ISS Avenger falls apart in a ball of flame.)
[Captain's quarters]
(Hoshi and Archer are in bed, again.)
ARCHER: Before I forget, first thing tomorrow, I want you to erase the
historical database. I don't want anyone else getting any ideas about
this Federation of Planets.
HOSHI: We'll lose all the data on our counterparts.
ARCHER: Exactly.
HOSHI: It'll only take a day for the fleet to return to Earth. Do you
think the commanders will support you?
ARCHER: They're loyal to the Emperor. They don't really care who it is.
By the time the fleet arrives, the reign of Emperor Jonathan Archer
will have already begun.
(He pours drink into his mouth.)
ARCHER: Once we put down the rebellion, I'll expand the Empire
throughout, throughout
(He falls off the bed.)
HOSHI: Are you all right?
(She goes to the door and lets in Travis, who sees Archer trying to
crawl. Hoshi kisses Travis. Archer dies.)
[Bridge]
HOSHI: Open a channel to Fleet Admiral Gardner.
CREWWOMAN: Channel open.
HOSHI: This is the Starship Defiant. If you don't surrender
immediately, we'll begin targeting your cities. Respond.
GARDNER [on viewscreen]: Where's Archer? Who the hell are you?
HOSHI:You're speaking with Empress Sato. Prepare to receive
instructions.

  [Corridor]
 PAXTON: How serious?
DOCTOR: If the swelling gets worse, it could inhibit her breathing.
PAXTON: I told you to notify me if there was any trouble. Now, you say
this has been going on for days?
DOCTOR: The monitoring equipment didn't detect the symptoms until this
morning.
[Medical unit]
DOCTOR: It isn't calibrated for this type of
patient.
(He checks the readout on the incubator's monitor/)
PAXTON: Well?
DOCTOR: Fever's diminished. She's fighting it off.
PAXTON: That's good news, for both of you.
DOCTOR: Intravascular pressure has stabilised. Blood oxygenation is
good.
PAXTON: She looks so innocent. It's almost possible to forget what she
represents.
DOCTOR: We don't want to disturb her.
PAXTON: No.
(They leave, and we get a good look at a little blue-eyed baby with
pointed ears.)
Captain's Starlog, January 19, 2155. Enterprise has
been called home for what could prove to be a pivotal moment in human
history.
[Starfleet Command]
(In San Francisco, Starfleet is acting as a
conference centre where representatives from several worlds are seated
around a large horse-shoe shaped table, listening to a speech by a
human. It is being taped by the press, and there are also spectators,
including the Enterprise crew standing on a staircase.)
SAMUELS: Having endured a catastrophic World War, Earth's governments
came to this city for the purpose of creating a just and lasting peace
among nations. Today, we have assembled here again, representatives of
numerous worlds, to forge an unprecedented alliance. With this
Coalition of Planets, we seek to strengthen our bonds of friendship,
render permanent the peace that now exists among us for the ongoing
exploration of our galaxy. Let us dedicate ourselves to these worthy
goals so that future generations can look back upon this moment with
pride and eternal gratitude. Thank you.
(Applause, although Tucker is less than enthusiastic.)
ARCHER: People are watching.
TUCKER: Nobody knows that better than him.
ARCHER: Clap louder. That's an order.
PHLOX: I thought it was a fine speech.
TRAVIS: Just missing a few names.
REED: You'd think this was all his idea.
HOSHI: It's not about who gets credit.
TUCKER: He could've at least mentioned Enterprise. Who does he think
got the Andorians and Tellarites talking?
T'POL: I'm sure history will reflect our contribution.
TUCKER: Not if he's writing it.
ARCHER: That's enough.
(Archer leads his people down to meet Nathan Samuels.)
SAMUELS: I hope I didn't embarrass myself too much.
ARCHER: Far from it, Minister.
SAMUELS: Call me Nathan. I want to thank you again for attending.
Having Enterprise here seems to put everyone at ease. People feel
comfortable in the presence of heroes.
ARCHER: Whatever we can do to help.
SAMUELS: Well, it certainly helps that the delegates can understand
each other. These universal translators work perfectly, thanks to you.
HOSHI: I just updated them with a few things we picked up on the
mission.
SAMUELS: Whatever you did, they're extremely precise. Though, when I'm
listening to the Tellarite ambassador, I wish they were just a little
less precise.
T'POL: You've set a formidable goal. The drafting of a charter in six
weeks?
SAMUELS: I've always believed that formidable goals produce formidable
results.
(Meanwhile, a lady member of the press meets up with Travis.)
GANNET: I decided to stop waiting.
TRAVIS: For what?
GANNET: You to come over and say hello.
TRAVIS: You were busy working.
GANNET: We never had a problem mixing work and pleasure. Smile. I never
could get you to smile for the camera.
TRAVIS: How have you been, Gannet?
GANNET: Busy. There haven't been many slow news days since the Xindi
attack. I hear you're going to be in the neighborhood awhile.
TRAVIS: At least until the conference is over.
GANNET: We should get together. If we wait another four years, we're
going to have too much catching up to do.
TRAVIS: Can't argue with that.
GANNET: I'll pretend that was an enthusiastic yes. Back to work.
(They split up and we watch a pale woman in a coat come into the
conference without a security badge.)
T'POL: Commander Tucker does have a point. Enterprise laid the
foundation for this event. Perhaps it should be you they're
photographing.
ARCHER: Samuels likes the spotlight, and he's welcome to it.
KHOURI: They're going to kill her.
T'POL: Excuse me?
KHOURI: Don't let them.
(She puts a vial into T'Pol's hand and then collapses.)
KHOURI: I'm sorry.
(Phlox opens her coat to reveal a nasty stomach wound.)
REED: It's a phase-pistol wound.
PHLOX: She's going into shock. Get me a med kit!
[Sickbay]
PHLOX: I just received word from Starfleet Medical.
The wound was too severe. She didn't survive.
REED: Do they think it could have been self-inflicted?
PHLOX: They didn't say. Do we know who she was?
T'POL: Her name was Susan Khouri. She was a medical technician. She'd
been having some emotional trouble. Took a leave from work over a year
ago.
TUCKER: Any idea who the hair belonged to?
PHLOX: I have a very good idea. (He goes to the main monitor.) PHLOX: It was from
a child no more than six months old. I used every DNA identification
protocol I'm aware of. I even used a Klingon procedure.
ARCHER: Go ahead.
PHLOX: It contains Vulcan and human DNA. I had the computer search for
any matches in the Starfleet databank. When I got the results, I ran
the search three more times just to be certain.
ARCHER: And?
PHLOX: According to every analysis, this child is the offspring of
Commander Tucker and Commander T'Pol.
[T'Pol's quarters]
(T'Pol is trying to meditate when the doorbell
chimes.)
T'POL: Come in.
TUCKER: We got to talk about this.
T'POL: It's difficult to talk about something that doesn't make sense.
TUCKER: Phlox said DNA doesn't lie.
T'POL: Neither do I. I've never been pregnant, Trip.
TUCKER: Then how do you explain all this?
T'POL: I can't. Do you believe me?
TUCKER: Yeah. Phlox must be wrong, that's all there is to it. If you've
never been pregnant, then you can't have a baby.
T'POL: Trip, the moment Phlox said that the child was ours, I knew it
was true.
TUCKER: But you said you'd never been
T'POL: I haven't.
TUCKER: Then what are you saying?
T'POL: I can't explain how it exists, but I know it does. There's a
child out there, and it's ours.
TUCKER: How do you know that?
T'POL: I'm Vulcan.
[Conference room]
(It's too big to be the Captain's mess, and there
are flags in the corner now.)
SAMUELS: Fortunately, the news hasn't spread to the general public, and
I'd like to keep it that way.
ARCHER: If we made an announcement, someone might come forward with
information.
SAMUELS: An announcement of this nature could derail the conference.
ARCHER: How?
SAMUELS: You haven't spent much time on Earth lately. After the Xindi
attack, there was a dangerous increase in xenophobia.
ARCHER: We got a taste of it.
SAMUELS: It died down somewhat, but not completely. There are still
people out there who want us to stay in our little corner of the
galaxy. The news of a Vulcan-human hybrid could inflame them, give them
something to rally against.
ARCHER: I can't believe we're talking about more than a small minority.
SAMUELS: As I said, you've been away for a while.
ARCHER: Maybe I just have a little more faith in humanity than you do.
SAMUELS: Can't afford to operate on faith. There's more at stake here
than a simple trade agreement. You fought the Xindi. You know better
than anyone how Earth's survival depends on alliances with other
species. We don't have the Vulcans watching our backs anymore.
ARCHER: This isn't about finding someone else to watch our backs.
SAMUELS: All I'm saying is that there's strength in numbers.
ARCHER: All right. I was hoping you'd have some word on the
investigation. My Engineer and Science Officer are eager to get some
answers.
SAMUELS: I'm sure they are, but I've heard nothing new.
ARCHER: There's got to be something we can do.
SAMUELS: Starfleet investigators are more than capable of handling
this. I suggest we let them do their job. I'll notify you the moment I
hear something. I appreciate your co-operation.
(Samuels leaves, and Archer goes to the comm. panel.)
REED [OC]: Reed.
ARCHER: It's Captain Archer. I want you to talk to an old friend.
[Dockside, night]
(A seagull cries, then a voice comes from the mist.)
HARRIS: The last time we spoke, you asked me to never contact you
again.
REED: I contacted you. Susan Khouri
HARRIS: First, we need an understanding.
REED: About what?
HARRIS: That by speaking to me, you're back in the game. Simple as
that.
REED: Who was she?
HARRIS: She was more than just an emotionally troubled nurse. She was a
member of an underground isolationist movement, Terra Prime.
REED: I've heard of them. They want to stop all contact with alien
species.
HARRIS: They believe it's corrupting our way of life.
REED: I remember they made a lot of noise back when Enterprise was
launched.
HARRIS: They had a resurgence following the Xindi attack. We think
Khouri was trying to leave the movement.
REED: That's why they killed her?
HARRIS: Her defection may have had something to do with the child.
REED: I was getting to that.
HARRIS: The child belongs to two of your crewmen. You tell me.
REED: They claim they don't know anything about it.
HARRIS: That doesn't seem likely, does it?
REED: I believe them.
HARRIS: I admire your loyalty. We think Terra Prime is involved, and
that they're planning something.
REED: You just don't know what?
HARRIS: We suspect it has something to do with the child. Find it, and
we'll have the answers.
[Paxton's office]
(The establishing monochrome shot suggests we're
on Moonbase Alpha.)
PAXTON: You recruited her.
DOCTOR: I needed her expertise. I thought she was reliable.
PAXTON: Obviously, you were mistaken.
DOCTOR: If she'd told them anything truly damaging, I think we'd know
it by now.
PAXTON: We can't be sure what she told them. Anyway, I'm more concerned
with why she turned away from us.
DOCTOR: I think that she might have become attached to the patient. She
spent a great deal of time caring for her.
PAXTON: And what about you?
DOCTOR: Me?
PAXTON: Yes. You've spent as much time with that child as she did.
DOCTOR: I feel no differently about it than anyone else that I've
treated.
PAXTON: This isn't anyone else. This is an abomination. And when the
time comes, it will be treated as such.
DOCTOR: I understand. (Paxton looks out of the window towards Earth.)
PAXTON: Well, I'm going to
miss this place. The simplicity. There's no middle ground here and I
can see the Earth. Send in Greaves on your way out.
DOCTOR: Yes, sir.
(The doctor leaves, and nods to a big, big man who enters.)
GREAVES: I gave the men your message. We'll be ready at a moment's
notice.
PAXTON: Tell them I appreciate their hard work.
GREAVES: They already know.
PAXTON: There's one other thing. A loose end that needs tying up. Put
together a group, have them meet me at the third junction in, say, one
hour.
GREAVES: Done.
[Starfleet Command]
SAMUELS: The Tellarites are pushing for an embargo
against the Orions. They claim they've been attacking their freighters.
CORIDAN: We have traded with the Orions for centuries. We would've
known of these attacks. This is Tellarite slander.
SAMUELS: You have to appreciate their point of view.
CORIDAN: The Tellarites only want to deprive us of valuable commerce.
Coridan will never agree to any trade sanctions.
SAMUELS: Ambassador, Captain Archer.
ARCHER: Ambassador.
CORIDAN: I need to contact my government about the today's
developments. Excuse me.
(He leaves them.)
SAMUELS: How can I help you?
ARCHER: I want everything Starfleet has on the investigation.
SAMUELS: Why come to me?
ARCHER: Because the Chief Investigator turned me down. You can change
his mind.
SAMUELS: I can't do that. I'm sorry.
ARCHER: Susan Khouri was a member of Terra Prime.
SAMUELS: If that's true, it's extremely troubling.
ARCHER: Not as troubling as something else we learned. You were once a
member.
SAMUELS: It seems you're doing fairly well investigating on your own.
ARCHER: That's why you wanted this kept quiet.
SAMUELS: I've already explained why there was a need for secrecy. I was
very young when I joined Terra Prime.
ARCHER: You were eighteen.
SAMUELS: Didn't you make any questionable choices when you were that
age, Captain? It was a stupid mistake. I was a fool. My father had died
in a freighter accident and I blamed the pilot, who happened to be
Denobulan. We all have our demons. I've exorcised mine.
ARCHER: I don't care what you did when you were young, Minister. I need
your help.
SAMUELS: I underestimated you. I suppose I'm not the first person to
make that mistake. You'll have your case file within the hour.
ARCHER: Thank you.
[Travis' quarters]
(He's in casual clothes, working at his computer
when the doorbell chimes.)
GANNET: (camera apparently on) I can't decide if I like you better in
uniform or not.
TRAVIS: What are you doing here?
GANNET: I've been assigned to do a story on Enterprise. They can build
a ship that goes faster than light, but they can't give you a
decent-sized room.
TRAVIS: A story?
GANNET: It's told from the perspective of the crew. It'll cover the
missions, the perils, life in space. So, shall we start with a tour?
TRAVIS: I've got some work to do.
GANNET: You're not on duty.
TRAVIS: Gannet. (She switches off the camera.)
GANNET: Okay, so, maybe I wasn't assigned
the story. Maybe I suggested the idea to my editor.
TRAVIS: He know how you feel about space exploration? That it's the
last vestige of colonial impulse?
GANNET: I only said that to keep you from signing onto this mission.
TRAVIS: Find another story to do.
GANNET: It's too late. It's due a week from today.
TRAVIS: Then you're going to have to find another source for your
information.
GANNET: Why are you avoiding me?
TRAVIS: Can you give me one reason why I shouldn't avoid you?
GANNET: We both called it off. It was a mutual decision.
TRAVIS: And it looks like you've changed your mind.
GANNET: I haven't decided yet.
TRAVIS: That's the first honest thing you've said.
GANNET: So, reward me by giving me that tour.
[Sickbay]
TUCKER: Got a minute?
PHLOX: Certainly.
TUCKER: This baby, can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
PHLOX: It's a girl.
TUCKER: A girl. Is it okay? I mean, it's part human and part Vulcan.
PHLOX: Vulcan and human physiology are not all that dissimilar. From
the evidence I have, there's no reason to believe she's anything but
perfectly healthy.
TUCKER: That's good to hear.
PHLOX: You'll also be interested to know she has your eyes, and T'Pol's
ears.
TUCKER: I still can't believe it.
PHLOX: I'm in something of a quandary about it myself. Especially since
T'Pol's never been pregnant.
TUCKER: She could have gotten pregnant and not told me about it.
PHLOX: And she had the embryo removed, also without your knowledge? I
believe you know the answer to that theory, Commander.
TUCKER: Yeah, I guess I do.
PHLOX: We'll get to the bottom of this soon enough. Until then, I
suggest you keep any such theories to yourself.
TUCKER: That's good advice. You know, my father always wanted a
granddaughter. He bugged my sister about it constantly.
PHLOX: It seems he got his wish.
TUCKER: Yeah.
[Paxton's office]
(He's watching a recording on a screen. The speaker
is talking to an audience and being applauded.)
GREEN [on screen]: In the shadow of this incalculable devastation, we
find ourselves facing a colossal challenge. There's an entire world to
rebuild. Not only our cities and homes, but mankind itself! Now is not
the time not the time for timidity and second guessing. We cannot
afford to doubt ourselves.
(Greaves enters.)
PAXTON: The Third World War had just ended and the cease-fire was
barely three years old.
GREEN [on screen]: Unless we act decisively, we will pass on the scars
of mutation and decay to future generations.
GREAVES: Colonel Green.
PAXTON: Colonel Green. One of many men history has misunderstood.
GREEN [on screen]: For the sake of our children, and our children's
children, we must reject the impure and cast it out!
PAXTON: (switching off the screen) Before my father died and left me in
this facility, I was studying to be a historian. Until I had a very
verbal confrontation with a certain professor who claimed that Green
was nothing more than a genocidal madman.
GREAVES: Sounds like we had the same professor.
PAXTON: Green euthanised hundreds of thousands who were afflicted with
radiation damage. Their millions of descendants would've endured
horrible disease, yet history, history never says anything about that
suffering that Greene prevented.
GREAVES: Guess it all depends on who writes the history.
PAXTON: Makes me wonder if I'll be remembered with any more accuracy.
GREAVES: I don't think you're going to be misunderstood.
PAXTON: Really? Sometimes, I'm not certain I understand myself.
GREAVES: We did what we had to do, not what we wanted to do.
PAXTON: I'm sure Greene told himself the same thing.
GREAVES: He was right, and so are we.
PAXTON: Daniel, you are a wise man.
GREAVES: Medical report on the patient. Her symptoms are gone. She's
one hundred percent.
PAXTON: That's wonderful. Wonderful. Thank you.
(After Greaves leaves, Paxton goes to his desk, gets out a hypospray
and injects himself.)
[Corridor]
(Gannet is getting her tour and interview.)
TRAVIS: That was some serious flying, trying to keep the warp fields
aligned. Columbia was fifty metres above us. One wrong move and we
would've lost Commander Tucker.
GANNET: How did you keep your cool?
TRAVIS: When I was studying to be a pilot, I memorised something Chuck
Yeager said. I never let myself be afraid. I just focus on the dials
and concentrate on flying.
GANNET: That simple, huh?
TRAVIS: Most of the time, simple works best.
[Launch bay]
TRAVIS: These are the shuttlepods.
GANNET: Which one did you use to penetrate the Sphere in the Expanse?
TRAVIS: Shuttlepod One. Do you want to see inside?
GANNET: If it's okay. (Travis opens the hatch for her.)
[Shuttlepod]
GANNET: Beautiful little ship.
TRAVIS: I always thought so. Unfortunately, we use the shuttlepods less
and less.
GANNET: Why?
TRAVIS: We're getting more comfortable with the transporter.
GANNET: Makes sense. Gets you there in a few seconds.
TRAVIS: Yeah, but there's no skill involved.
GANNET: Nothing to fly.
TRAVIS: I've always had a tendency to get attached to machines. It's
crazy, but every time we use the transporter, I feel we're kind of
turning our backs on these guys.
GANNET: You can't make a choice without leaving something behind.
TRAVIS: When I saw you at that conference, I started thinking about
things, decisions I've made.
GANNET: Is it my imagination, or are you actually opening up to me?
(She takes off the camera.)
TRAVIS: Don't do that.
GANNET: What?
TRAVIS: Whenever things get a little serious, you always turn it into a
joke.
GANNET: It's a bad habit. I have a lot of those. (She kisses him.) GANNET: Here's
another one. When I'm attracted to someone, I can't hide it for long.
TRAVIS: You and your bad habits.
(They get into a serious clinch.)
[Conference room]
REED: The autopsy data confirms what we already
knew: Susan Khouri was killed by phase-pistol fire.
T'POL: The case file contains very little else in the way of evidence.
Some biographical data on Khouri. Most of it's out of date.
REED: They don't even know where she'd been living for the past year.
It's like she dropped off the face of the Earth.
PHLOX: That may be exactly what happened.
REED: You know something?
PHLOX: Her blood had elevated levels of growth hormone. I ran some more
tests and found traces of myofibrilin.
REED: That's what they prescribe for extended zero-G missions. It's
hardly used anymore outside of military exercises. Not since the
invention of artificial gravity.
PHLOX: It is still given to workers in remote places where artificial
gravity isn't practical.
ARCHER: Like mining colonies.
T'POL: The nearest one is Orpheus, on the moon.
REED: I have heard that the moon is a hotbed of Terra Prime activity.
You know, I think Travis has a friend who worked on Orpheus. He might
be able to get a couple of us inside. We could pay a little visit,
undercover.
TUCKER: I want to be a part of that visit.
T'POL: I'd like to volunteer as well.
ARCHER: Tell Travis to see what he can do.
REED: Yes, sir.(At the Orpheus Mining Facility he workers have air in the mine, but they're
lifting and moving rocks by hand for some strange reason. Then they
discover the battered body of the doctor.)
Captain's Starlog, supplemental. With help from
Travis's contact, Trip and T'Pol have been processed into the Orpheus
Mining Facility.
[Orpheus Mining Facility]
(We see a rock face being cut by an industrial
laser.)
TUCKER: This is the second time we've been through here. We've seen all
this before.
T'POL: We still have twenty minutes before we have to report to the
foreman.
TUCKER: Maybe you downloaded an outdated map.
T'POL: The map is correct.
TUCKER: Maybe you're reading it wrong.
T'POL: We could ask for directions.
TUCKER: Give me that. (He takes the PADD off her.) TUCKER: I think I know what the
problem is.
T'POL: What?
TUCKER: We're lost. Let's try that direction.
T'POL: Any particular reason?
TUCKER: It's the only tunnel I don't recognise.
(They have left a busy work area behind.)
T'POL: Trip.
TUCKER: I think we're getting there.
T'POL: I know you're not convinced I've told you the truth, about the
child.
TUCKER: What do you mean?
T'POL: You think I might have gotten pregnant without your knowledge.
TUCKER: I never said that.
T'POL: I know.
TUCKER: You been talking to Phlox.
T'POL: No. Have you?
TUCKER: Look, it's because you're Vulcan, isn't it, that you know all
this.
T'POL: I believe so.
TUCKER: I am sick and tired of this bond we've got. T'POL: I don't particularly enjoy it, either.
TUCKER: Listen, for the last time and for the record, I do believe you.
And if you get anymore feelings. What?
(He follows her gaze to a door labeled Quadrant 3.)
TUCKER: There it is. Come on, let's go.
[Travis' quarters]
(It's dark, because there are clothes scattered
everywhere, and the couple are in bed. She's still wearing her push-up
bra, though.)
TRAVIS: I'm glad we finally left the shuttlepod.
GANNET: I thought you liked shuttlepods.
TRAVIS: I like flying them.
GANNET: Sure felt like we were flying. I have a rule. If I'm in bed
with someone, they have to be in bed with me.
TRAVIS: What was that?
GANNET: You are not here.
TRAVIS: I'm just worried about some friends of mine.
GANNET: Want to talk about it?
TRAVIS: I'm under orders not to talk about it.
GANNET: That's the last thing you should tell a reporter.
TRAVIS: Let's change the subject. How come you haven't settled down?
GANNET: I'm never going to settle down. It doesn't mean I'm not going
to get serious with someone, if the right circumstance comes along.
TRAVIS: And what constitutes the right circumstance?
GANNET: I'll know it when it happens. What did you mean earlier about
reconsidering some decisions you've made?
TRAVIS: I've spent my whole life in space, going from one place to the
next. Seeing you, I was wondering, maybe the next challenge, at least
for me, is to stay in one place for a while.
(They kiss. Again.)
[Bridge]
REED: Hoshi.
HOSHI: Hmm? (She's working on a translator device.) HOSHI: No word yet from
Trip or T'Pol.
REED: Is there anything I can help with?
HOSHI: Six of the universal translators started confusing Rigelian with
Andorian. There's a glitch somewhere, but I can't find it.
REED: Carry on.
[Orpheus Mining Facility]
(Tucker is wandering around with his map.)
JOSIAH: Fresh off the boat? One of the S-K models. They only give them
to grubbers.
TUCKER: I guess you found me out.
JOSIAH: Josiah.
TUCKER: Turner.
JOSIAH: What brings you to this dump site?
TUCKER: Change of scenery.
JOSIAH: Yeah, that's what I was after, too. Only it wasn't the
landscape I got sick of. At least there aren't as many of them up here.
Seems like everywhere you go, humans are getting to be an endangered
species.
TUCKER: Know what you mean.
JOSIAH: Bad enough you can't walk down the street without some freak
show scaring the hell out of your kids. Now the government's making
treaties with them.
TUCKER: Sometimes I wonder where it's all going to end.
JOSIAH: It's going to end with human beings becoming second-class
citizens on their own world.
TUCKER: Someone's got to make a stand.
JOSIAH: Yeah, that's how I feel, too. Some of us are meeting tonight at
twenty two hundred. Level seven, junction four. I think you'll like
what we have to say.
TUCKER: I'll try and make it.
JOSIAH: I'll look for you.
(He leaves and T'Pol turns up.)
T'POL: I've learned something.
(Trip shushes her.)
TUCKER: One of the locals isn't very fond of Vulcans. You were saying?
T'POL: A doctor from one of the medical facilities was found dead
yesterday. They think it was a cave-in.
TUCKER: You're not buying it.
T'POL: He worked at the same clinic as Susan Khouri.
TUCKER: I think we each know what we're doing tonight.
[Level 7, Junction 4]
JOSIAH: Seven million people wiped out by aliens.
Did the Xindi even apologise?
ALL: No!
JOSIAH: Did our government ever demand an apology?
ALL: No!
JOSIAH: And where are the reparations for the families of those seven
million? And now those same leaders want to form a Coalition with
Tellarites, Andorians, Rigelians, Coridanites and Vulcans! Vulcans, who
not too long ago, massacred forty five humans working at the Earth
embassy! Nathan Samuels claims that future generations will look back
on this era with pride. But if things keep going the way they're going,
there won't be any future generations. At least not human. I love
humanity too much to sit by and let that happen.
(Meanwhile, T'Pol is scanning the area where the doctor's body was
found when she gets shot.)
JOSIAH: It's estimated that there are at least five thousand
unregistered aliens on Earth. Now, another study puts that figure at
ten thousand. This insanity is the direct result
of our government's policy and the enforcers of that policy, Starfleet!
We need to send a message to the people in power. And there's someone
here tonight who is going to help us do just that. Commander Tucker, of
the Starship Enterprise!
(Everyone turns to stare at him.)
[Travis' quarters]
TRAVIS: All that stuff I said about leaving the
ship.
GANNET: Of course, it's off the record. While you're on duty, you mind
if I stay here and work a bit?
(The doorbell chimes. Travis opens the door to Archer and Reed, with
two MACOs in attendance.)
ARCHER: I need to speak to Gannet.
GANNET: Something wrong?
ARCHER: Come with us.
GANNET: Where?
TRAVIS: What's going on?
GANNET: She's not here to do a story on Enterprise, Travis.
REED: She's a spy for Terra Prime.
[Orpheus Mining Facility]
(Josiah pushes Tucker into a room. Greaves is already
there with T'Pol.)
TUCKER: Are you all right?
T'POL: I think so.
TUCKER: What did you do to her?
JOSIAH: Hey, hey.
GREAVES: Not nearly enough.
(The door opens.)
PAXTON: It's not worth it, Romeo. Juliet's in good hands. The two
star-crossed lovers. I can't help but wonder whether your little drama
will end happier than that famous double suicide in a medieval tomb.
TUCKER: Who the hell are you?
PAXTON: John Frederick Paxton. I run this facility.
TUCKER: Not for long.
PAXTON: You're right there, Commander. My mining business is about to
take a turn for the worse. Daniel, get started.
TUCKER: You're behind this.
PAXTON: Behind this? No. I lead this, and proudly too. Before you ask,
your child is safe and sound, finally sleeping through the night. I
forgot how much trouble a newborn can be.
TUCKER: I want to see her.
PAXTON: No. And no is a word that Starfleet better get used to hearing
from now on. Because up until today, it's always been yes, hasn't it?
Yes, yes, go right ahead. roam the stars. Yes, inform potentially
hostile species of the whereabouts of Earth. Yes, entrust the entire
future of our world to non-human creatures who don't even feel like we
do. Yes, promote the total degradation of mankind by encouraging
alien-human relations. Well, yes is a word that ends here and now. I'm
returning Earth to its rightful owners. I am giving Earth back to
humanity, back to human beings. It is my life's work. It is what I was
born to do, and there is no one, not an alien, not a human, that will
stop me from achieving it.
[Another room]
PAXTON: My father designed this facility. He knew
that mining was an unpredictable business. Mines tap out, veins dry up.
JOSIAH: Everyone's aboard, sir.
PAXTON: Go to launch mode, Daniel. You're an engineer. I think you'll
appreciate this. Take a good long look.
(The main superstructure of the mining facility starts to change
configuration. It
detaches itself from the moon's surface and engines start up.)
TUCKER: Where are we going?
PAXTON: For you, this'll be like a walk across the street. Lock it up.
(Steel shutters close across the windows.)
PAXTON: You better hang onto something. She gets a little rusty out of
the gate.
(Orpheus takes off.)
[Conference room]
ARCHER: You reconfigured your universal translator
to record messages from all the other translators. You were spying on
the delegates.
HOSHI: You accidentally triggered an ID protocol in the network. I
tracked it back to the source.
GANNET: I don't know what you're talking about.
REED: You sure know what everyone else was talking about.
TRAVIS: Maybe she was after a story. It doesn't mean she worked for
Terra Prime.
ARCHER: We did a background check. In the last month, you made three
trips to the lunar colony.
GANNET: Is that a crime?
ARCHER: Depends on what you're doing there.
GANNET: I was on assignment.
REED: For?
GANNET: My news agency.
REED: Your editor claims he never sent you.
GANNET: Look, if I'm under arrest, then
ARCHER: Two of my crewmen are at Orpheus Mining Complex. We've lost
contact with them.
GANNET: I don't know anything about your crewmen.
ARCHER: Are they in danger?
GANNET: I want to speak with counsel. Now.
ARCHER: Take her to the Brig. Get her whoever she wants.
(Reed takes Gannet away.)
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Bridge to Captain Archer.
ARCHER: I'm sorry, Travis. Archer.
CREWWOMAN: A large vessel is taking off from the mining facility.
ARCHER: Can you identify it?
CREWWOMAN: Sir, sensors indicate it is the mining facility.
[Orpheus Bridge]
JOSIAH: We're being hailed. It's Starfleet Command.
PAXTON: Ignore them. Reactor status?
GREAVES: Ready.
TUCKER: You're going to warp?
PAXTON: A five second burst.
T'POL: Inside the system?
TUCKER: We'll be lucky if we don't fly apart.
PAXTON: I plan on luck. Go.
GREAVES: Ten seconds.
(Everything starts shaking - a lot.)
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Hail them. Pursuit course, Travis.
TRAVIS: Aye.
HOSHI: No response, sir.
ARCHER: Tell Starfleet Command we're going after them.
[Orpheus Bridge]
GREAVES: We're in Mars orbit. All systems
functioning.
PAXTON: That was a magnificent piece of flying, Daniel.
GREAVES: That's yet to come.
PAXTON: Impress me again.
GREAVES: Taking us down.
(The metal doughnut descends through the red atmosphere.)
PAXTON: Let's see it.
(They're coming in to land near a massive ray-gun device.)
GREAVES: Slowing our descent.
(Big metal feet thump onto the surface.)
PAXTON: Tie us in.
(A clamp fastens onto a pipe.)
GREAVES: It's ours.
PAXTON: Let's take in the view. (The shutters open.) PAXTON: This is where it
all begins. Josiah.
[Bridge]
REED: They're on the surface.
ARCHER: Where?
REED: They've landed near the verteron array. It's used to redirect
comets.
HOSHI: They're sending a subspace message on all frequencies.
PAXTON [on viewscreen]: My name is John Frederick Paxton. I've just
taken over the verteron array on Mars. I can now fire on any ship or
facility in the system.
(The big ray gun turns and fires a beam.)
REED: He's targeted Earth's moon.
(A new lunar crater is born.)
PAXTON [on viewscreen]: I have no intention of using this weapon again,
provided that every single non-human in our system leaves immediately.
A new era is at hand, an era that will expose the concept of
interspecies unity as an absolute and vicious lie. An era that will
witness the advent
of a human-centred consciousness
[Orpheus Bridge]
PAXTON: that will place our world before all
others. As of this moment, mankind casts off the shackles of alien
interference and now determines its own fate.
[Bridge]
PAXTON [on viewscreen]: Terra Prime forever.

The Enterprise Transcripts - Terra Prime
Terra
Prime
 Original Airdate: 13 May, 2005
  T'POL:
Previously, on Enterprise.
 SAMUELS [Starfleet
Command]]: Today we have assembled representatives of
numerous worlds to forge an unprecedented alliance.
PAXTON [Orpheus Medical Facility]: It's
almost possible to forget what she represents.
PHLOX [Sickbay]:
According to every analysis, this child is the offspring of Commander
Tucker and Commander T'Pol.
HARRIS [San Francisco]: We
think Terra Prime is involved, and it has something to do with the
child. Find it, you'll have the answers.
T'POL [T'Pol's quarters]: I've
never been pregnant, Trip.
TUCKER: Then how do you explain all this?
REED [Travis' quarters]:
(detaining Gannet) She's not here to do a story on Enterprise, Travis.
She's a spy.
PAXTON [Orpheus Bridge]:
I'm returning Earth to its rightful owners.
(The mining facility lands on Mars.)
PAXTON [on viewscreen]: I've just taken over the verteron array on
Mars. I can now fire on any ship or facility in the system.
(He blasts a new crater on the Moon.) 
[Bridge]
PAXTON: I have no intention of using this weapon again,
provided that every single non-human in our system leaves immediately.
I know there will be questions. We've been dealing with non-humans for
almost a century.
ARCHER: Block that transmission.
HOSHI: He's on every frequency. The signal's going system-wide.
ARCHER: Target his ship. Take out their communications.
REED: He's tied his warp reactor into the array. If we hit him, it'll
take out half of Utopia colony
ARCHER: Open a channel to Starfleet.
PAXTON [on viewscreen]: Judge the evidence for yourselves.
HOSHI: Everything's jammed.
PAXTON [on viewscreen]: The citizen soldiers of Terra Prime will act to
protect you against the most dangerous enemy that humanity has ever
faced.
(The baby is shown on the viewscreen.)
[Starfleet Command]
PAXTON [OC]: Do not be deceived. This is no
ordinary, innocent child. This is an alien-human hybrid. Living proof
of what will happen if we allow ourselves to be submerged in an
interstellar coalition. Our genetic heritage
SAMUELS: I want that transmission blocked.
MAN [OC]: We're trying. We can't break through the signal.
SAMUELS: Then find some way to contact Enterprise. I want to speak to
Archer.
[Bridge]
PAXTON [on viewscreen]: Terra Prime is dedicated to
the protection of life in all of its diversity. So for the next twenty
four hours, we guarantee safe passage to all aliens
leaving our solar system. So long as non-humans keep to their own
worlds,
ARCHER: Scan Paxton's ship for Vulcan biosigns. Get a transporter lock
on the baby and T'Pol.
PAXTON [on viewscreen]: But if any alien, if one single alien remains
after the deadline, Terra Prime will defend the sovereignty of every
single human being
(The image zooms in on a building.)
PAXTON [OC]: And we will begin by destroying the institution whose
blind arrogance and moral cowardice have put us all at risk. Starfleet
Command. We do not seek war, but if the aliens do not leave, and force
us to fight, I make this solemn promise to all of the sons and
daughters of Earth. Our future will be secure because humanity will
prevail.
REED: He's targeted us with the array. Apparently, they don't like
being scanned.
ARCHER: Get us out of here.
(The verteron beam strikes out at Enterprise.)
ARCHER: Damage?
REED: Massive power surge! We've lost half our relays. The beam was
only two percent of the array's total output. He could have vaporised
us.
ARCHER: We'll consider ourselves warned. Set a course to Earth.
[Starfleet Command]
SAMUELS: (to a woman, as Soval gestures to him) If
you'll excuse me.
WOMAN: Of course.
SAMUELS: Ambassador?
SOVAL: Spontaneous demonstrations have already begun around the Vulcan
compound.
SAMUELS: Isolated incidents, I'm sure.
ANDORIAN: There are protesters chanting outside the Andorian embassy.
And they're using words that aren't in the universal translator.
SOVAL: It's obvious Paxton's ultimatum is part of a co-ordinated plan.
ANDORIAN: Why are we all still here? We could be obliterated at any
second!
SAMUELS: Paxton's a fanatic, but he's a man of his word. He won't act
before his deadline's up.
SOVAL: The deadline aside, the fact that Paxton has the support of so
many of your people is almost as troubling.
ANDORIAN: I agree. Earthmen talk about uniting worlds, but your own
planet is deeply divided. Perhaps you're not quite ready to host this
conference.
[Ready room]
ARCHER: Paxton's holding two of my officers hostage
at the array. We can't attack it.
SAMUELS: The Council's aware of that. If you can't bring yourself to
fire on them, another Captain can be assigned to Enterprise. No one
will think less of you.
ARCHER: It's not just the hostages. Any attack on the array will
trigger a massive explosion that could kill thousands of colonists.
SAMUELS: This wasn't an easy decision for the Council. The potential
for disaster's even greater than you think. Over the next thirty
months, the terraforming project has fourteen comets set to collide
with Mars. Without the array to divert them toward the polar caps, the
comets could hit anywhere, even the domed cities.
ARCHER: I'll take in a small team. We'll break into the facility and
stop them.
SAMUELS: Paxton can destroy any ship that approaches Mars.
ARCHER: If he can't see us, he can't destroy us.
[Orpheus Medical Facility]
PAXTON: It's unharmed, just as I said.
T'POL: Her medical readings appear normal.
PAXTON: There's nothing normal about it.
TUCKER: She's not an it.
T'POL: How did you obtain our genetic material? The child is a binary
clone.
TUCKER: They'd need cells from both of us.
PAXTON: The medical freezers on your ship hold bio-samples from your
entire crew. Terra Prime has supporters everywhere.
TUCKER: Someone on Enterprise helped you? Who?
PAXTON: I've let you see your daughter. That's my half of the bargain.
Now it's your turn.
(Tucker and Paxton step out of the room, so we can see the module label
03-47 by the door.)
PAXTON: I need to make modifications on my ship.
TUCKER: I'm listening.
PAXTON: I need you to refine my targeting system.
TUCKER: You really think I'm going to help you turn that array into a
weapon?
PAXTON: You really think I'm going to give you a choice?
(Josiah puts a gun to T'Pol's head.)
[San Francisco - night]
HARRIS: Two meetings in the span of a week. People
might start to talk.
REED: I don't like it any more than you do.
HARRIS: So, you want to go to Mars and you need my help.
REED: You know the situation.
HARRIS: I believe I'm aware of the broad strokes. I also understand
Paxton's tapped into the planetary sensor grid. No one can get within a
thousand kilometres of the verteron array without being detected.
REED: And you're going to tell me how.
HARRIS: What makes you think I even have that information?
Because your section routinely thinks about the unthinkable. And
because you'd never miss a chance to put me in your debt.
HARRIS: You're a good judge of character. The grid was designed to
function in the planet's original atmosphere, but terraforming's made
the air much thicker.
REED: How does that help us?
(Harris hands over a computer file which Reed puts into a PADD.)
HARRIS:
Sections of the grid continually need re-calibration and are prone to
false signals. You can exploit that weakness. The good news is, with
terraforming there's no more need for pressure suits in the lowland.
Oxygen, yes. Thermal garments
REED: According to this, if we keep our altitude less than ten metres
above the surface, Paxton won't see us.
HARRIS: You'll still need to reach the surface undetected.
REED: That part's taken care of, without your help.
HARRIS: So, the student has surpassed the teacher. When you're finished
with Mars, why don't you come work for me?
REED: I've got quite enough to keep me busy on Enterprise.
HARRIS: And if Archer's coalition is formed, Enterprise could be busier
than ever.
REED: Indeed? Well, then I imagine this'll be the last time we meet.
HARRIS: Always the optimist. Good luck, Malcolm.
(Harris offers his hand, and after a slight pause, Reed shakes it.)
[Conference room]
ARCHER: Comet Burke, deflected by the array eight
years ago. Set to hit the north pole of Mars at dawn.
SAMUELS: You're not serious.
TRAVIS: I have experience with comets, sir.
REED: Compared to penetrating Xindi defenses, this'll be a walk in the
park.
SAMUELS: But that's only fourteen hours from now. What happens if this
plan of yours doesn't work?
ARCHER: Enterprise will destroy the array as ordered.
[Orpheus - T'Pol's room]
(T'Pol has the baby in her arms when Paxton comes
in.)
PAXTON: All the rocking in the world will not make that child Vulcan or
human.
T'POL: Human and Vulcan genes produced this child, which indicates our
two species have more similarities than differences.
PAXTON: Don't you realise that baby is, (his hand shakes) That baby is
as much a threat to your species as it is to mine?
T'POL: She's not a threat.
PAXTON: That child is a cross-breed freak. How many generations before
our genome is so diluted that the word human is nothing more than a
footnote in some medical text? The same thing could happen to your
people, or don't you care about that?
T'POL: Neither of our species is what it was a million years ago, nor
what it'll become in the future. Life is change.
PAXTON: Change in this case means extinction, and I, for one, will not
let that baby bring humanity to that point.
T'POL: I won't let you hurt her.
PAXTON: I won't have to.
(As he turns to leave, T'Pol quickly scans him.)
T'POL: What does that mean?
[Bridge]
TRAVIS: We're within range.
ARCHER: Bridge to Engineering.
[Engineering]
KELBY: Kelby here.
ARCHER [OC]: We're coming up on the comet.
KELBY: I'm on it, sir. This is it, people. Cycle the ports. Ensign, rig
the intakes for cometary debris.
ENSIGN: Yes, sir.
KELBY: Engineering is good to go, sir.
[Bridge]
KELBY [OC]: You've got full impulse and warp
standing by.
ARCHER: All right, Travis, let's hitch a ride to Mars.
TRAVIS: Aye, aye, sir.
[Brig]
(Travis is in thermal clothing to pay a jail
visit.)
GANNET: Thank you for seeing me.
TRAVIS: What's so urgent?
GANNET: I never got my lawyer.
TRAVIS: You'll have to talk to the Captain.
GANNET: Apparently, he's busy.
TRAVIS: We all are. That's it?
GANNET: I don't work for Terra Prime. I work for Starfleet
Intelligence.
TRAVIS: That's not possible.
(He opens the cell door and goes in.)
GANNET: You are not the only one who wants to serve his people.
TRAVIS: If you were an S.I. agent, you'd be out of this Brig with one
call to your division head.
GANNET: And then everyone on Enterprise would know who I am, including
the real Terra Prime operative.
(Travis' communicator chirps.)
TRAVIS: Mayweather, Go ahead.
REED: We're ready for you in the launch bay.
TRAVIS: On my way. You know I'm going to tell the Captain about this.
GANNET: He won't believe you.
TRAVIS: Probably not. Why are you telling me this now?
GANNET: You're going after Paxton. If someone on Enterprise is working
for him, he could know you're coming.
TRAVIS: So you're revealing all of this because you're worried about
me.
GANNET: Yes.
TRAVIS: I'm touched.
(He leaves the cell and locks the door.)
GANNET: Travis, wait!
TRAVIS: You're not going to manipulate me again. Goodbye.
[Launch bay]
ARCHER: Keep the sensors locked on the array. The
moment it powers up
HOSHI: I won't hesitate, sir.
ARCHER: I remember when you used to jump every time the engines
hiccupped.
HOSHI: I still do. I'm just better at hiding it.
REED: Captain.
ARCHER: Don't get too used to that chair. I'm going to want it back.
HOSHI: Understood.
[Orpheus Mining Facility]
(Tucker is working on the targeting scanners as
ordered.)
TUCKER: You know, I never used to like Vulcans all that much myself.
They always seemed so smug. Making us jump through hoops for every
little advance in warp technology, and they knew the answers all along.
So what was it with you? The ears? The fact that they're vegetarian?
JOSIAH: They're not human.
TUCKER: Well, you can't deny that.
JOSIAH: And they sat by while millions of our people died. World War
Three.
TUCKER: We didn't make contact with the Vulcans until ten years after
the war.
JOSIAH: But they were up there with their superior technology. They
could've stopped it, but they didn't. I think it suited their plans. A
devastated Earth was much easier for them to control.
TUCKER: Is that the kind of paranoid crap Paxton's been feeding you?
JOSIAH: Get back to work.
TUCKER: You ever actually met a Vulcan?
JOSIAH: Your friend. She's the first.
TUCKER: If you got to know some, actually took the time to talk with
one
JOSIAH: You obviously did more than talk. And look at what you got for
your trouble. Some half-human thing.
(Tucker stands up, obviously angry.)
JOSIAH: Go ahead.
TUCKER: Okay.
(He lands a great right uppercut on Josiah's jaw, then takes advantage
of the man's turned back to do something in a panel before he gets
kicked down.)
JOSIAH: You're a traitor. A traitor to humanity.
[Shuttlepod]
(The pod is launched into the tail of the comet,
where it gets buffeted by the ice.)
TRAVIS: Hull plating's steady at ninety four percent.
REED: What's wrong with the inertial dampeners?
TRAVIS: We need to maintain an erratic flight profile, so we look like
a chunk of the comet.
ARCHER: Thirty minutes to the atmosphere.
TRAVIS: I'm taking us closer to the nucleus. It's going to start
getting a little rough.
REED: Start?
PHLOX: Would you like me to give you something?
REED: I've already had the maximum dosage.
PHLOX: Here's a bag.
[Orpheus Mining Facility]
PAXTON: There's nothing aliens like better than to
see us fighting one another.
TUCKER: Where're T'Pol and the baby?
PAXTON: They're together. You'll eat as soon as you finish your work.
TUCKER: I am finished.
PAXTON: All you've done is try to sabotage the targeting system.
TUCKER: I don't know what you're talking about.
PAXTON: Please. I've been monitoring your work from the control centre.
To be honest, I'd have been disappointed if you hadn't tried to
sabotage the array. But you did, which proves you're a man of
principle. That is why I know you're going to refine the array just as
you promised.
TUCKER: I told you I'd make modifications to your ship-- not your
weapon.
PAXTON: In two hours I am going to fire a verteron beam directly at
Starfleet Command. Now, with this targeting system the way it is, I
will hit Starfleet but I'll also take out half of San Francisco along
with it. I need a scalpel, not a bludgeon.
TUCKER: I don't care what you need.
PAXTON: Starfleet's been warned, if that's what concerns you. Now you
can either help me, and a few empty buildings will be destroyed, or you
refuse me, and millions may die.
TUCKER: You told Starfleet when you're planning to fire the array. And
you don't think they're going to blast this facility off the face of
the planet?
PAXTON: If you are so eager for a bloodbath, a bloodbath is what you
will get. Put him in detention. And make sure he has a news screen. I
want him to see the bodies when they start to pull them from the
rubble.
[T'Pol's room]
(She's trying to bond with the baby.)
T'POL: Hello. I'm your mother. You're going to need a name. We should
discuss that with your father.
(She scans the child again.)
[Shuttlepod]
TRAVIS: The gravity's starting to tear the comet
apart.
(Reed has made use of the bag Phlox gave him.)
ARCHER: We're picking up ionisation from the upper atmosphere.
(The comet hurtles towards the Martian icecap. There's a sudden jolt in
the pod.)
REED: What was that?
TRAVIS: The engine shut down, but there were no warning lights. The
console's locked up.
ARCHER: Hull plating's offline. Hull temperature climbing! We're coming
in too hot.
(The pod is tumbling in the wake of the disintegrating comet.)
TRAVIS: Bypassing auto flight control. Switching to manual!
REED: At this speed?
TRAVIS: We're out of options.
(Their flight levels off, and the heat shield blackens.)
TRAVIS: Ground proximity?
ARCHER: Five seconds to impact.
(The comet hits, and the shuttlepod sails through.)
REED: Well, that was fun. Can we do it again?
[Orpheus Detention cell]
(Tucker examines his surroundings, and starts
putting together an impromptu tool kit to deal with the door lock.)
TUCKER: A Mark Three interlock.
[Shuttlepod]
(The pod swoops low over the Carl Sagan Memorial
Station and the remains of Pathfinder.)
REED: The closer we get, the more we risk being spotted by Paxton's
sensors.
ARCHER: Get close to that ridge line.
TRAVIS: I was thinking the same thing. You'll want to keep your arms
inside the vehicle at all times.
(He takes them in to land.)
[Mars]
REED: Thirty-two.
TRAVIS: Hmm?
REED: This is the thirty second planet I've set foot on.
PHLOX: Two hundred and forty eight.
ARCHER: The verteron array is on the other side of that rise. We'll
head through there.
[Orpheus Central Control]
(T'Pol is hauled in by Josiah.)
PAXTON: I'm told you have something to say to me.
T'POL: In private.
PAXTON: I keep no secrets from my men.
T'POL: You and I both know that's not true.
PAXTON: Josiah, give us the room.
JOSIAH: I'll be outside.
(He leaves.)
T'POL: My daughter's ill. You will arrange for medical care at once.
PAXTON: No one leaves this facility.
T'POL: You will provide immediate transport for my child, Commander
Tucker, and myself. The hospital at Utopia Colony will be suitable
until Enterprise arrives.
PAXTON: What, have you been inhaling the atmosphere? What makes you
think you can dictate terms to me?
T'POL: This.
(She grasps his twitching hand.)
T'POL: Taggart's Syndrome. Since you obviously didn't die by age
twenty, you're receiving treatment. Rigelian gene therapy?
PAXTON: You're not a doctor.
T'POL: The very thing you're warning humans to avoid is what's keeping
you alive. Alien knowledge, freely shared. You're not only a terrorist,
you're a hypocrite.
PAXTON: This is not the time for timidity and second guessing. We
cannot afford to doubt ourselves.
T'POL: Colonel Green also said, to be human is to be pure. Under his
rule, you would have been euthanised for having a genetic disorder.
PAXTON: I'm not the first significant leader who failed to measure up
to his own ideal.
T'POL: You're not significant!
PAXTON: History will determine that! So go ahead, tell my followers
what you wish. See if they take the word of an alien over mine. What's
wrong with your child?
T'POL: Elevated white-blood cell count, low-grade fever.
PAXTON: Well, its two halves are warring with one another. Alien and
human. Conflict was inevitable.
 He (opens the door.)
PAXTON: Josiah.
(Josiah comes in to take T'Pol away.)
PAXTON: Your child and the Coalition of Planets, both doomed from the
beginning.
[Mars]
REED: Ten metres.
(The array is visible between rocks.)
[Bridge]
SAMUELS: Paxton's deadline is up. We have to face
an unpleasant reality. Captain Archer's mission's failed.
HOSHI: Paxton will need two minutes to power up the array before he can
fire.
SAMUELS: Two minutes?
HOSHI: It's enough.
SAMUELS: I'm not prepared to take that chance. Your estimates could be
wrong.
HOSHI: I won't destroy the array unless we have no other choice.
SAMUELS: I understand your reluctance.
HOSHI: I'm following orders.
SAMUELS: I'm giving you new orders. Do it now.
HOSHI: I'm sorry, sir.
SAMUELS: I can have you relieved of duty.
HOSHI: Actually, I can only be relieved by a higher ranking officer in
my chain of command.
SAMUELS: Open a channel to Admiral Gardner.
HOSHI: Belay that order. I won't risk exposing our position by breaking
radio silence.
SAMUELS: You're risking the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
HOSHI: I know what I'm doing.
[Orpheus Mining Facility]
(The lock is blown and the away team enter.)
ARCHER: The guard's still walking away.
REED: There's another guard approaching.
(Reed and Archer prepare to ambush - Tucker)
TUCKER: Took you long enough.
ARCHER: Where's T'Pol?
TUCKER: Crew quarters, but Paxton's getting ready to fire the array.
REED: If he powers it up
ARCHER: Enterprise has orders to destroy the complex.
[Orpheus Central Control]
GREAVES: I've spoken to our operatives. There's no
indication that the Vulcans have withdrawn from their consulates in
Canberra or Berlin.
PAXTON: I never expected them to comply. Let's get this done.
[Bridge]
TACTICAL: I'm picking up a power surge in the
array.
SAMUELS: You're out of time. Destroy the complex now.
HOSHI: Take us in. Full impulse. Charge weapons.
[Orpheus Central Control]
PAXTON: Josiah, begin the firing sequence.
[Bridge]
TACTICAL: Target locked
SAMUELS: Give the order!
[Orpheus Central Control]
JOSIAH: Co-ordinates locked in.
COMPUTER: Two minutes to pulse activation.
(The away team burst in, in a flurry of phase pistol fire.)
ARCHER: Step away from the controls.
PAXTON: Jonathan Archer, the man who delivered us from the Xindi. Well,
look at you now.
ARCHER: Archer to Enterprise.
HOSHI [OC]: Go ahead, Captain.
ARCHER: We're inside the control room.
[Bridge]
HOSHI: Standing by.
[Orpheus Central Control]
ARCHER: Shut it down.
TUCKER: Main controls are in there.
(Josiah shoots Tucker, they shoot Josiah. Alarms sound. The gunfight
begins in earnest.)
COMPUTER: Ninety seconds to pulse activation.
(One of Archer's shots goes through a window near Paxton.)
ARCHER: The room's depressurising. Get Malcolm out of here! Go!
(Travis and Phlox drag the stricken Reed out of the room, and Archer
gets to his stricken engineer.)
TUCKER: Plasma grid, control panel.
PAXTON: I know the reason you turned your back on humanity. I blame
your father. He wanted the secrets of warp technology so badly, he
allowed the Vulcans to turn him into their pet human. And you, well,
the sins of the father.
(The window continues to splinter.)
COMPUTER: Plasma grid offline. Firing sequence aborted.
(Archer puts his oxygen mask on Tucker.)
PAXTON: My father never asked anything from anyone. His mining
operations transformed the moon from a mere colony into a completely
self-sufficient world, and that is how we should go to the stars.
Taking the worlds we need and taming them, with human hands, and human
minds, and human souls.
ARCHER: That might've worked for the moon, but the galaxy's a lot more
crowded than we thought.
PAXTON: That's not our problem.
ARCHER: It's an opportunity. It's over, Paxton.
PAXTON: We're each his father's child.
(The window finally gives up and Archer falls.)
PAXTON: I've been a miner all my life. You get used to the low oxygen.
(He gets to the control panel.)
COMPUTER: Firing sequence resumed. Pulse activation in thirty seconds.
(Archer tries another very tired fist fight, then resorts to the old
gun to the head ploy to get Paxton to cancel the firing sequence.)
COMPUTER: Pulse activation in fifteen seconds. Ten, nine, eight
PAXTON: I've locked the sequence. You can't stop it from firing. I've
locked it!
COMPUTER: four, three, two, one. Pulse activated.
PAXTON: Terra Prime, forever.
(Paxton passes out, and we see the beam hit San Francisco - the bay,
harmlessly, apart from a tidal surge.)
TUCKER: Looks like Paxton's aim was off.
ARCHER: With a little help from you.
TUCKER: Maybe a little.
[T'Pol's room]
TRAVIS: Commander.
T'POL: She's dying.
Captain's Starlog January 22, 2155. Enterprise is
returning to Earth. Paxton is in custody, but the consequences of his
actions continue to affect us all.
[Sickbay]
(T'Pol hangs an IDIC on the incubator.)
TUCKER: I guess we shouldn't keep calling her she.
T'POL: Elizabeth.
TUCKER: My sister would've liked that.
PHLOX: It appears my initial prognosis was incorrect. It's genetic. Her
Vulcan and human DNA aren't compatible.
TUCKER: Is there anything you can do?
PHLOX: I'm attempting to stabilise her nucleotides, but there's never
been a child like her.
T'POL: Her name is Elizabeth.
[Launch bay]
TRAVIS: I can't figure out why the console locked
up at the same time the engines shut down.
REED: It does seem a bit coincidental.
TRAVIS: Flight control and engine power are routed separately. until
they reach that junction. The panel's open. If ionised gas got in here,
it could've melted the primary circuits of both systems.
REED: It could've been knocked loose by an impact.
TRAVIS: No. It's been forced. This was deliberate.
[Kelby's quarters]
KELBY: Come in.
REED: On your feet, sir. Shuttlepod One was sabotaged.
KELBY: Sabotaged?
REED: We nearly crashed!
TRAVIS: Is this your signature?
KELBY: Yeah. You think I had something to do with it?
REED: Is there any reason why we shouldn't?
KELBY: That's a shuttlepod maintenance log. Commander Tucker took me
off that team when he came back from Columbia.
REED: Who replaced you? Who!
KELBY: Ensign Masaro.
[Mess hall]
HOSHI: They really want to postpone the conference?
SAMUELS: Postpone is a diplomatic way of saying it's dead. Paxton's
unnerved them, and there's not a lot I've been able to say to change
their minds.
(Her communicator chirps.)
HOSHI: Excuse me, sir. Sato, go ahead.
[Archer's quarters]
ARCHER: It's Archer. Are you still with Samuels?
[Mess hall]
HOSHI: We're in the mess hall.
[Archer's quarters]
ARCHER: Is Ensign Masaro there?
[Mess hall]
HOSHI: No, I don't see him, sir.
[Corridor]
ARCHER: We think Masaro may be working for Terra
Prime.
[Mess hall]
ARCHER [OC]: Samuels may be in danger.
[Corridor]
ARCHER: Reed and Mayweather are on their way.
[Mess hall]
HOSHI: Wait here, sir.
[Corridor]
(She meets Reed and Travis just outside the Mess
hall.)
HOSHI: Samuels is in here. He's safe.
[Outside the Turbolift]
MASARO: (with a phase pistol) Captain.
ARCHER: You don't want to do this.
MASARO: (upset and scared) I have to.
ARCHER: Give me the phase pistol. That's an order.
MASARO: I can't, sir.
ARCHER: Ensign.
MASARO: I wanted you to know I'm sorry. I believed in what we were
doing. Tell my parents I'm sorry. I never wanted anyone to get hurt.
(He puts the gun to his own head, and pulls the trigger.)
ARCHER: Ensign!
[Sickbay]
(The loving parents are at the incubator of their
dying child. Tucker's left arm is in a sling.)
PHLOX: I wish I could do more.
ARCHER: I know.
PHLOX: When you invited me to join this crew, I thought it would be an
interesting diversion for a few months. Some time away from the
complications of family, which on Denobula can be extremely
complicated. I didn't expect to gain another family. (close to tears)
It hurts as if she were my own child. Make something good come from
this, Captain.
[Starfleet Command]
(Everyone is back around the table, and the
Enterprise senior staff are standing at the end.)
SAMUELS: Fellow delegates, this last week we've seen what humans can be
at their worst. But we cannot, we must not use that as an excuse to end
the dream that began here. For then, the demons of our past will have
won. Instead, I want to look to the future and begin by honouring the
people responsible for our being here tonight. They represent all of us
at our best.
ARCHER: Up until about a hundred years ago, there was one question that
burned in every human, that made us study the stars and dream of
traveling to them, Are we alone? Our generation is privileged to know
the answer to that question. We are all explorers, driven to know
what's over the horizon, what's beyond our own shores. And yet, the
more I've experienced, the more I've learned that no matter how far we
travel, or how fast we get there, the most profound discoveries are not
necessarily beyond that next star. They're within us, woven into the
threads that bind us,
all of us, to each other. The final frontier begins in this hall. Let's
explore it together.
(Soval rises to his feet and begins the applause.)
[Corridor]
GANNET: I hear the conference is back on track.
TRAVIS: It's a first step. The Captain says it's going to take years to
work out the details.
GANNET: But it'll happen, and you're part of the reason why.
TRAVIS: Just doing my job.
GANNET: So was I.
TRAVIS: I know.
GANNET: If Vulcans and Andorians can get along, you'd think we could.
TRAVIS: A lot of details to work out.
(This angle shows us they are at the Transporter alcove.)
GANNET: Isn't that the fast way home?
TRAVIS: The least I can do is give you a ride.
(He takes her hand.)
TRAVIS: The Launch Bay's this way.
[T'Pol's quarters]
T'POL: Come in.
TUCKER: (trying not to cry) The delegates at the conference, they've
asked about the service for, for Elizabeth. They want to attend.
T'POL: She was important.
TUCKER: There's something else. I spoke with Phlox. It turns out there
was a flaw in the technique that Paxton's doctors used in the cloning
process. Human DNA and Vulcan DNA, Phlox says there's no medical reason
why they can't combine. So if a Vulcan and a human ever decided to have
a child, it'd probably be okay. And that's sort of comforting.
(T'Pol takes his hand)
Transcribers
personal note - with a slight
rearrangement of the final scenes, it is my opinion that Enterprise
should have ended with Archer's speech. The next episode is totally
missable, unwarranted, and frankly even worse than Spock's Brain. And
that's saying something when you're a life-long Trek fan as
I am.

[Bridge]
TRAVIS: When are they expecting you in Brazil?
HOSHI: I told them a couple of weeks after the ceremony. With all the
receptions, and then I'll need at least a week to clear up the
linguistic database.
TRAVIS: After ten years on this ship, I'll bet it'll take a while
getting used to the humidity again.
HOSHI: And the bugs.
REED: Does the Captain have to give a speech?
T'POL: He's working on it now.
TRAVIS: He hates giving speeches.
REED: And he'll undoubtedly make every effort to take no credit.
T'POL: Undoubtedly.
HOSHI: That'd be like Zefram Cochrane not taking credit for warp drive.
(Archer enters from the Ready room.)
ARCHER:
How do you pronounce the name of
the second Tellarite liberator? Challash?
HOSHI: Shallash.
ARCHER: Shallash, thanks.
REED: How's it going, sir?
ARCHER: Whatever I write, it sounds like I'm trying to take credit for
this.
T'POL: Captain, Admiral Douglas is asking you to approve the
decommission protocols.
ARCHER: One thing at a time. After the charter's signed, I'll give him
whatever he needs to put Enterprise in mothballs.
CREWMAN [OC]: All senior staff, report to the Bridge.
RIKER: Computer, freeze programme.
(The camera swings around to show
Enterprise D's First Officer in uniform at a station.)
RIKER: Save from this
time index.
COMPUTER: Programme saved.
RIKER: End programme.
(Our Enterprise bridge and crew vanish, and he's wearing his Next
Generation uniform on an empty holodeck,)
RIKER: First Officer's Personal Log,  Stardate
47457.1. With the unexpected arrival of Admiral Pressman, my
old CO, I find myself in an awkward position. Counsellor Troi has
suggested I might get a few insights by calling up an historic
holo-programme.
[Ten Forward]
TROI: You're sure you don't want to talk about what
happened?
RIKER: I've told you everything I can.
TROI: If it's a question of breaking a promise.
RIKER: Not a promise. An order.
TROI: Have you learned anything on the Holodeck about breaking orders?
RIKER: Not yet. I've gone back a couple of days earlier to get a
perspective. But I really don't see
how this is going to help.
TROI: That's why you run a starship and I'm a counsellor.
[Corridor]
RIKER: Reed's shorter than I thought he'd be.
TROI: Maybe the programme's off.
RIKER: No, I'm sure it's fine. It's just, you expect larger than life
people to be larger than life.
TROI: Has the Andorian hailed them?
RIKER: Not yet.
TROI: You might want to leap ahead to that point. It's where things
start really happening. And you should consider taking over the Galley.
RIKER: Why?
TROI: Well, Starfleet ships didn't have counsellors in those days, but
the Chef on the first Enterprise came pretty close. I read almost
everybody confided in him.
RIKER: I'll keep that in mind.
TROI: Supper?
RIKER: You bet. I'll give you an update.
TROI: Okay.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: That's impossible. Shran's been dead for
what, three years? (Hoshi opens the channe.l) SHRAN: This is quite a surprise.
SHRAN: [on viewscreen]: I'm sorry, pinkskin, but it was essential
certain people believed I had met my demise.
ARCHER: Including me.
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: I know it's been a while, but as I recall, you
still owe me a favour.
ARCHER: I remember. But this isn't a good time, Shran. I assume you
know where we're heading.
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: I may no longer be a member of the Imperial
Guard, but I'm aware of the proposed coalition.
ARCHER: It's more than a proposal. We're on our way to Earth to sign
the charter.
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: The ceremony isn't for three days. If my plan
works, you'll be home in plenty of time.
ARCHER: I'm afraid a detour is out of the question right now.
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: My child's been abducted! Kidnapped. You owe me.
ARCHER: You never told me you had a child.
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: Jhamel gave birth five years ago. A daughter.
They've taken her.
ARCHER: Who?
SHRAN [on viewscreen]: Former associates. It's a long story. You need
to let me come aboard.
ARCHER: Set a rendezvous course.
RIKER: Computer, freeze programme. Advance ahead one hour. Switch to
objective mode.
(People change position, Riker is back in his normal uniform to walk
through the walls into the - )
[Ready room]
SHRAN: Who would've thought civilian life would be
more dangerous than commanding a ship for the Imperial Guard.
ARCHER: I still don't understand why you left. You were a hero.
SHRAN: A hero with a family. I always believed that change was a good
thing. I was a fool.
ARCHER: Why would you fake your own death?
SHRAN: I made some poor choices. Picked the wrong friends. People
involved in questionable
business ventures. They think I took something that belonged to them.
With the help of some old colleagues from the Guard, I managed to make
myself disappear. It worked for nearly three years.
ARCHER: Your friends found you?
SHRAN: Six months ago. I've been on the move ever since. They took her
in the middle of the night. I was in the next room, asleep. Useless!
It's been a week. They say if I don't return what's theirs, they'll
kill her.
ARCHER: Then give them what they want.
SHRAN: I don't have it! I never did.
ARCHER: But you have a plan.
SHRAN: It cost me everything I had, but I managed to find out where
they've taken her. They're on a trading outpost, Rigel Ten.
ARCHER: I'm familiar with it.
SHRAN: I know these men quite well, Captain. I can outwit them, I've
done it before. But I'll need at least seven men. You have to help me.
It's my little girl.
[Archer's quarters]
T'POL: He's an admitted criminal. You said so
yourself.
ARCHER: He said he fell in with some disreputable people. That doesn't
make him a criminal.
T'POL: If we're late for the ceremony, it will have far-reaching
consequences.
ARCHER: If Shran hadn't helped us, I never would've gotten aboard the
Xindi weapon. Have you forgotten that? This alliance is based on
friendship and loyalty, exactly what Shran is looking for right now.
T'POL: I don't trust him.
ARCHER: You don't trust Andorians. You never have. Thank God the Vulcan
Council is a little more enlightened than you are. If they're willing
to forge an alliance with Andoria, the least you can do is give Shran
the benefit of the doubt. When we met ten years ago, I didn't trust
you. For that matter, I didn't trust any Vulcans. You helped me get
past that, remember? I listened to you, now it's your turn to listen to
me. I can't turn my back on him, T'Pol. Try to understand.
T'POL: I'll try.
ARCHER: By the way, drop by the galley when you get a moment. Chef's
trying to come up with a menu for our last dinner together. He wants to
know everybody's favourite dish.
T'POL: There are eighty three crewmembers aboard.
ARCHER: Just go see him, all right?
(She leaves, and Porthos jumps up to his master)
ARCHER: Don't worry. Chef's promised at least six kinds of cheese.
[Galley]
T'POL: I appreciate the gesture, but it's not
necessary to prepare a special dish for me.
RIKER: (as the chef) Come on. I've already started to reduce the
plomeek broth. All I need to know is which roots you prefer.
T'POL: In that case, I prefer to be surprised.
RIKER: Pull up a chair. I could use the company. I heard a rumour I may
be whipping up some Andorian cabbage soup tonight.
T'POL: We have already lost five hours picking up Shran's shuttle. Now
we're going to lose at least another day diverting our course to Rigel.
RIKER: His child's in danger.
T'POL: Is there anything aboard this ship you don't know?
RIKER: Jonathan is a compassionate man. You should know that by now.
T'POL: His compassion has gotten us into trouble on many occasions. We
could miss this ceremony.
RIKER: Don't worry. I've got a hunch you're going to make it. Tea?
T'POL: Thank you.
RIKER: Phlox has giving me his largest Edosian suckerfish.
T'POL: Excuse me?
RIKER: Looks like a catfish. I'm hoping it tastes like one. Commander
Tucker's crazy for catfish.
Do you ever miss him?
T'POL: I spent the morning with him, recalibrating the plasma array.
RIKER: That's not what I mean.
T'POL: If you're referring to our intimate relationship, that's been
over for six years.
RIKER: But the question remains, do you miss him?
T'POL: I'm Vulcan. I don't miss people.
RIKER: Sorry, I forgot. Is he as concerned as you are about making this
ceremony?
T'POL: Trip rarely questions the Captain's decisions.
RIKER: He doesn't strike me as someone who follows orders blindly.
T'POL: He's not. He simply tends to agree with the Captain most of the
time. He trusts him.
RIKER: Would you peel these for me? (A bowl of large carrots.)
T'POL: Before I joined this crew, I never could have imagined anything
more important than following orders.
RIKER: And now?
T'POL: Humans believe that sometimes you have to follow your instincts.
A very illogical approach, but one I've come to embrace.
RIKER: Computer, freeze programme. Thanks. (Riker kisses her on the cheek.)
[Briefing room]
(Riker is going through the crew roster of the USS
Pegasus - Cdr Ronald Moore, Lt Dawn Velazquez, Cn Eric Motz, Cn Andy
Simonson, Ens Phil Wallace - when Deanna comes in.)
TROI: There you are. (sees the screen) Someone you know?
RIKER: Someone I knew.
TROI: Pegasus?
RIKER: Phil Wallace. Hell of a handball player. Pressman was getting
ready to promote him.
TROI: How many died?
RIKER: Seventy one. All but nine of us.
TROI: How do you feel about learning the ship wasn't destroyed?
RIKER: What difference does it make? Seventy one people died.
TROI: You're feeling guilty. You think in some way you were
responsible?
RIKER: You're the empath. Why don't you tell me?
TROI: I think it's something else. Something about seeing that ship
again.
RIKER: Why don't we change the subject? Okay?
TROI: Okay. How did things go on the Holodeck?
RIKER: They picked up the Andorian. They're on their way to Rigel Ten.
TROI: I was referring to any insight you may have gained.
RIKER: I took your advice about the Chef. You were right. T'Pol opened
up to me.
TROI: Have you met with Commander Tucker?
RIKER: No, I haven't made it to Engineering yet. Have you spent any
time on the NX-01?
TROI: I've never run the programme.
RIKER: What about the ship itself?
TROI: I think I went when I was a little girl, but I get all those
museum ships mixed up.
RIKER: Now's your chance. Come on down with me.
TROI: I have an appointment in an hour.
RIKER: I'll get you back in plenty of time. Come on.
[Ready room]
RIKER: Our brig is bigger than this.
TROI: A lot of things change in two hundred years. (He nearly backs
into a girder.) TROI: Watch yourself!
RIKER: No fish tank.
TROI: How could Archer survive without a fish tank?
(She goes to the door, but it doesn't open automatically for her.)
RIKER: Allow me.
[Bridge]
RIKER: He does have a dog, though.
TROI: Right, I remember. One of the Musketeers.
RIKER: Porthos. (Troi sits in the Captain's chair.)
TROI: Ooh, comfy.
RIKER: No seat for the First Officer?
TROI: Perhaps Archer wasn't as fussy as Captain Picard when it came to
people sitting in his chair.
(Riker's expression suggests that Travis's seat is a tad too small for
him. Troi goes to the science station and activates the viewer.)
TROI: I remember seeing one of these in a photograph.
RIKER: Kirk's ship had them, I think.
[Corridor]
RIKER: Engineering's down this way.
TROI: There's something lonely about a ship without its crew.
RIKER: Computer, add an appropriate crew complement, objective mode.
TROI: That's better.
[Engineering]
REED: If you recall, Rigel Ten is filled with a
very unsavoury element. And I rather doubt Shran's scheme will be quite
as simple as he claims.
TUCKER: I can't imagine the Captain would put us in jeopardy this close
to signing the charter.
REED: I don't like it. What exactly are you doing?
TUCKER: These injectors need to be purged every six months. Are the
deuterium filters clear?
CREWMAN: We've done all but three.
TUCKER: Make it quick.
CREWMAN: Aye, sir.
REED: Well, what's the point? This ship will be joining the mothball
fleet next week.
TUCKER: I pretty much built this engine. Plan to take care of it as
long as I can. Been a hell of a run, Malcolm. never thought it would
come to an end.
REED: All good things. Captain thinks there'll be another Enterprise
before too long.
TUCKER: I imagine.
REED: It won't be the same.
TUCKER: That's okay. Come on.
TROI: It's sad. Commander Tucker had no idea he wouldn't make it back.
[Situation room]
ARCHER: How reliable are your sources?
SHRAN: They're criminals, but honourable ones. They promised me that
Talla's being held here at Upper Level Four. Have you fashioned the
amethyst?
T'POL: The photograph you gave us had poor resolution, but I'm
confident our replication will look authentic.
SHRAN: The Tenebian amethyst they think I stole was flawless. They'll
undoubtedly have magnifying equipment with them.
T'POL: They'll need a spectral micrometer to see it's a fabrication.
ARCHER: How many do you expect to show up?
TROI: Computer, freeze programme. (She steps in front of Archer.) TROI: He's cute.
RIKER: Don't get any ideas.
TROI: Reg'll be furious if I'm late. Are you going to stay?
RIKER: Yeah, for a little while.
TROI: Good luck. Computer, Arch.
(She leaves for her appointment with Barclay.)
RIKER: Computer, how long before they reach Rigel Ten?
COMPUTER: Sixteen hours, twenty two minutes.
RIKER: Advance to that point. Stay in objective mode.
[Bridge]
ARCHER: Move into a stationary orbit.
TRAVIS: Aye, sir.
ARCHER: Put a team together. Meet us in the Launch bay.
TUCKER: Captain, can I have a word with you? (Reed and Shran get into
the turbolift.) TUCKER: We can handle this without you.
ARCHER: Well, that's flattering.
TUCKER: You know what I mean. You've got the biggest day of your life
coming up. A lot of people are counting on you being there.
ARCHER: I appreciate you worrying about me, but I'll be fine.
TUCKER: You don't need to be putting yourself in harm's way. I'm
telling you, we can take care of it.
ARCHER: Rigel was the first place we visited, remember? Now it's going
to be the last. Poetic justice. Why should you have all the fun?
[Shuttlepod]
(Riker is in MACO uniform for this sequence.)
TRAVIS: We're going through the troposphere. Might get a little bumpy.
T'POL: Have you been down to see Chef yet?
TUCKER: First thing this morning. You?
T'POL: He talked about you.
TUCKER: Me?
T'POL: Us.
TUCKER: What about us?
T'POL: It's not important.
TUCKER: Why'd you bring it up, then?
T'POL: Do you ever miss me?
TUCKER: You mean?
T'POL: Yes.
TUCKER: You know how long it's been?
T'POL: That's not what I asked you.
TUCKER: Well. Yeah, I guess, sometimes.
T'POL: I haven't thought about those days in a long time.
TUCKER: Benefit of being a Vulcan.
T'POL: After speaking with Chef, I realised we may never see each other
again.
TUCKER: What are you talking about?
T'POL: We're taking different assignments. There's no way of knowing.
TUCKER: There's every way of knowing. I can guarantee you we're not
going to lose touch. Stop thinking like that.
T'POL: However long it may be, I believe I'm going to miss you.
ARCHER [OC]: Archer to Shuttlepod Two.
TRAVIS: Go ahead, sir.
ARCHER [OC]: Shran's made contact. Everything's set. I'll lead you in.
TRAVIS: Understood.
[Rigel X]
(Shran and T'Pol are surrounded.)
ALIEN: Stop there. Unless I'm mistaken, I thought you had no idea where
the amethyst was.
SHRAN: Where's my daughter?
ALIEN: Funny how a missing child has a way to jog the memory, eh,
Shran?
SHRAN: Where is she?
ALIEN: I thought you were happily married. Who's the Vulcan?
SHRAN: I'm not interested in your associates, so don't question mine.
ALIEN: Put the case down and open it.
T'POL: We want the child first.
ALIEN: I could shoot you both.
T'POL: You'll never get this case open, I promise you.
ALIEN: You let a female negotiate for you, eh, Shran?
SHRAN: You heard her.
(A woman brings a little blue girl out, holding her wrist firmly.)
SHRAN: Are you all right?
TALLA: I'm hungry.
ALIEN: Now open the case.
(Shran holds the case but looks at his daughter the whole time T'Pol is
unlocking it. The cut sapphire is enormous.)
ALIEN: Set it down. Now, back up.
SHRAN: Let her take the girl.
ALIEN: Fine, but you stay. One step, and this little blue beauty won't
have a father to come home to.
(Talla is freed to run to Shran's arms.)
SHRAN: I want you to go with T'Pol. You'll be safe with her. She'll
find you something to eat. Obey your father.
(Talla and T'Pol leave.)
ALIEN: Now step back.
(He picks up the gem and scans it as the Enterprise team watch from
above. Shran raises his arm to shield his eyes.)
ALIEN: What are you doing?
(Tucker fires a laser at the sapphire, and the refractions blind the
alien and his associates. Shran escapes and the phaser fire starts.)
REED: Stand still and you won't be harmed.
(The aliens return fire, of course. One shot breaks the plank Tucker is
standing on, and he's dangling in midair as Archer tries to pull him to
safety)
ARCHER: Hold on!
(Reed takes out the last alien as Tucker is okay.)
TUCKER: Thanks, boss.
ARCHER: Any time.
[Launch bay]
(The two shuttlepods are back safe and sound, and
the crews are disembarking.)
SHRAN: You're certain it won't be a problem?
ARCHER: I'll feel more comfortable getting you away from your friends
at warp four.
SHRAN: My shuttle may be slow, but their ships can barely make warp
two.
ARCHER: All the same, you'll be under your own power by tomorrow night.
We'll contact your wife and tell her to expect you the next morning.
SHRAN: I told you my plan would only take a few hours.
ARCHER: You're welcome. You should let Phlox take a look at her before
you go to your quarters.
SHRAN: Whatever you say, Captain.
TALLA: Thanks, pinkskin.
TUCKER: You must be getting tired of saving my life.
ARCHER: I'm glad I didn't take your advice about not coming along.
TUCKER: Yeah, you and me both. Then again, you almost got yourself
killed down there. Wouldn't have gone over too big at the ceremony.
ARCHER: Signing documents are easy. Training a new engineer, that can
be a real pain in the ass.
[Counsellor's office]
(Enterprise D has arrived at the Devolin system's
asteroid field.)
DATA [OC]: Data to Counsellor Troi.
TROI: Yes, Data.
DATA [OC]: I was wondering if this might be an appropriate time to
continue our discussion on the long-term effects of space travel on my
positronic net.
TROI: Can I give you a rain check? DATA [OC]: You may check me for rain if you like, Counsellor, but I assure you
there is no water in my (Doorbell chimes.)
TROI: Data, I'll get back to you. Come in.
RIKER: I know it's past office hours.
TROI: What is it?
RIKER: It won't be long before they find the Pegasus.
TROI: You haven't made your decision. The holodeck?
RIKER: They rescued the Andorian's daughter.
TROI: So you're coming to the moment of truth in there, as well.
RIKER: I need you to promise you'll keep this confidential.
TROI: You know I will.
RIKER: What do you know about the Treaty of Algeron?
TROI: 2311. It redefined the Romulan Neutral Zone.
RIKER: It also outlawed the use of cloaking technology on Starfleet
vessels.
TROI: The Pegasus?
RIKER: A secret group in Starfleet Security developed a prototype.
Pressman was put in charge of testing it.
TROI: That's why they're so eager to find it before the Romulans do.
RIKER: The accident, the seventy one people who died, we were testing
the cloaking device.
TROI: It was covered up.
RIKER: The nine of us who made it back alive were sworn to secrecy.
TROI: And you've lived with that for twelve years?
RIKER: They want to pick the experiment up where they left off.
TROI: Are you sure?
RIKER: Pressman told me himself. What they're doing is wrong. It could
jeopardise the treaty.
TROI: And you want to tell that to Captain Picard.
RIKER: I took an oath of secrecy. Pressman still outranks the Captain.
TROI: Will, you didn't get this far in your career making easy
decisions. I'm confident you'll make the right one now.
RIKER: I wish I was.
[Galley]
(Reed and Chef Riker are rolling pastry.)
REED: He was anything but tactful. What his countrymen might refer to
as a hick.
For the life of me, I couldn't understand what Captain Archer saw in
him.
RIKER: Thinner. Roll it a little bit thinner, like this.
REED: Yeah, right.
RIKER: Go on.
REED: That's about it, really. I used to think that first impressions
meant something. I guess it's not always true. To be honest, I didn't
think he was going to last a month, old friend of the Captain's or not.
And now, I can't imagine what these last ten years would've been like
without him.
RIKER: Did you ever find yourself attracted to him?
HOSHI: Maybe a little. I never really thought he was my type. Didn't
even graduate college, he learned about engineering working on boat
engines, I think. Never cared much about languages, could barely speak
English. But he did have his moments. I still find him kind of cute.
Keep that to yourself.
RIKER: Always do. Captain said they'd known each other a long time.
TRAVIS: Close to twenty years. He taught the Captain how to scuba dive
somewhere off the coast of Florida.
RIKER: You're pressing too hard. Just slow, steady movement.
TRAVIS: Sorry.
RIKER: No need to apologise.
TRAVIS: They've got a shorthand they use sometimes. Comes from spending
so much time together.
RIKER: Did Trip ever take a swing at Picard?
TRAVIS: At who?
RIKER: Archer, Captain Archer?
TRAVIS: Not that I know of. When push comes to shove, Commander Tucker
usually ends up doing the right thing. How am I doing?
RIKER: Don't let it get too big. Now fold it over. There you go.
PHLOX: And he's always pushing himself, often to the point of
exhaustion. He's forced me to order him to relax on more than one
occasion.
RIKER: To relax?
PHLOX: Yeah. Wasn't very keen on getting neuro-pressure treatments from
T'Pol, but it was that or become addicted to sedatives.
RIKER: If I remember correctly, that's when
PHLOX: Their romance began? Precisely. One time, he became so exhausted
I had to demand he get six hours sleep. He negotiated it down to four.
A very stubborn young man. (Waving the pastry around.) PHLOX: I quite enjoy
this.
RIKER: So did he follow your orders?
PHLOX: Didn't have a choice.
RIKER: You've always got a choice.
{Captain's mess]
(The two old friends are splitting a bottle.)
TUCKER: So do you think this alliance is going to hold?
ARCHER: We'd better hope so. There are thousands of planets within
reach. Got to start somewhere.
TUCKER: Who would have guessed? Vulcans and Andorians in the same bed.
ARCHER: The Tellarites were never big fans of the Andorians, either.
This is a special bottle of whiskey. Zefram Cochrane gave it to my
father the day they broke ground at the warp five complex.
TUCKER: And here we are, toasting to warp seven.
ARCHER: Here's to the next generation.
TUCKER: Written your speech yet?
ARCHER: I always crammed before exams. I've got three days left.
TUCKER: The biggest day of your life, and you're going to wait until
the night before.
ARCHER: It's the biggest day of our lives.
TUCKER: I hate to contradict you, Captain. You're the man they're
waiting to see.
(There's a sudden sharp jolt.)
ARCHER: Archer to the Bridge. What's going on?
T'POL [OC]: We're under attack, sir. A small vessel.
ARCHER: Who are they?
T'POL [OC]: We don't know yet. (another jolt) Intruder alert.
[Corridor]
ALIEN: We've come for Shran and the child.
TUCKER: I thought you said their ship couldn't catch up to us.
ARCHER: Remind me to mention that to Shran.
ALIEN: You're leaving me very little choice.
ARCHER: Shran left six hours ago. You're too late.
ALIEN: You're lying. His shuttle is still in your launch bay. Kill him.
TUCKER: Hold on. Wait a minute.
ARCHER: I'll take care of this.
TUCKER: The hell you will. I'll bring you to Shran. I know where he is.
ARCHER: I gave you an order, Commander.
TUCKER: You heard me. I said I'd bring you to Shran.
ARCHER: Trip!
ALIEN: Very well. Turn around, both of you.
TUCKER: Hey, this guy's the Captain.
ARCHER: That's enough.
TUCKER: He's my boss. If I'm going to disobey his order, I don't want
him coming along.
ARCHER: Trip, that's enough!
TUCKER: Listen. I won't do this if you kill him, but could you please
shut him up?
(Archer gets knocked out. Tucker goes to help.)
ALIEN: Stop. You can't expect me to just leave
him here alive?
TUCKER: He's out cold. He's not going to cause any trouble.
ALIEN: (to henchman) Stay here. If we're not back in ten minutes, kill
him.
TUCKER: Didn't you hear what I just said? I won't help you if you kill
him. This might take longer than ten minutes.
ALIEN: Take me to Shran or I'll kill him right now.
TUCKER: Okay, okay! I've got a better idea. I'll bring Shran to us. We
don't have to go anywhere.
ALIEN: Be very careful. (Tucker leads the group around the corner.)
TUCKER: You can all come see for
yourselves. This is just a comm. station. (He opens a pair of doors and
steps in.) TUCKER: I'm going to need to open this so I can bypass the security
protocols. Is that okay?
ALIEN: As long as you keep your hands where we can see them.
TUCKER: No problem. (Tucker takes a large panel from the wall, reaches in and
removes a large tube.) TUCKER: Now, all I need to do is connect this to the
relay inside that panel.
ALIEN: Stop. Open it for him. If there's a weapon in there, you're
going to die before your Captain.
(The henchman removes the ceiling panel.)
TUCKER: Satisfied?
ALIEN: Proceed. Hurry up. You're running out of time. (Tucker takiesdown a similar tube and prepares to join them
together.)
TUCKER: There's just one other thing I need to tell you. You can all
go straight to hell.
(The explosion blows the aliens out of the compartment and partway back
down the corridor. Archer wakes up and goes to the scene of the
devastation.)
ARCHER: Trip?
[Sickbay]
MEDIC: He's not responding.
PHLOX: Add two percent syntho-surfactant.
ARCHER: Doctor.
PHLOX: The plasma was super-heated. It thermalised his lungs.
Initialise the hyperbaric sequencer. (Tucker is badly burnt and struggling to breathe.)
TUCKER: Sorry about the
rifle-butt. I was just trying to
ARCHER: I know, Trip. Just take it easy. Everything's all right.
TUCKER: We gonna be late?
ARCHER: No. We'll be right on schedule. I'll even have time to write my
speech.
TUCKER: Great news. Wait till they hear (Alarm sounds.)
PHLOX: We need to get him into the chamber now!
(Archer helps the medics put Tucker on the trolley.)
PHLOX: Clear!
(As Archer pushes him into the chamber, Tucker smiles at him.)
[Trip's quarters]
(T'Pol gazes at a picture of a scuba diver before
putting it with other personal effects in a case. Then she picks up a
uniform and smells it before the door opens.)
ARCHER: Need any help?
T'POL: No, thank you.
ARCHER: For his parents?
T'POL: Will they still be coming to the ceremony?
ARCHER: I told them I thought Trip wouldn't want it any other way.
Don't forget this. (He hands her the Frankenstein's monster figure.)
T'POL: I'd like to meet them.
ARCHER: His parents?
T'POL: Yes. I'd like to meet them.
ARCHER: They're a little eccentric. I think you'll see where Trip got
his sense of humour.
T'POL: My mother was somewhat eccentric, as well.
ARCHER: I remember.
T'POL: Trip told me as the years went by that I would miss her less.
But he was wrong, because I find myself missing her more. Why would he
tell me that?
ARCHER: Time heals all wounds, but absence makes the heart grow fonder.
I guess it's a little tricky. Emotions have a way of contradicting
themselves.
T'POL: And you wonder why we suppress them.
ARCHER: When I took command ten years ago, I saw myself as an explorer.
I thought all the risks
would be worth it because, just beyond the next planet, just beyond the
next star, there would be something magnificent, something noble. And
now Trip is dead, and I have to give a speech about how worthwhile it's
all been.
T'POL: Trip would be the first to say it was worthwhile.
[Galley]
TUCKER: Fried catfish with hush puppies.
RIKER: Obviously, the Captain mentioned why I wanted to see you.
TUCKER: Keep in mind, within a week I'll be eating the real thing. I'm
taking my folks down to Mobile.
RIKER: Nothing like a challenge.
TUCKER: Captain asked for meat loaf, didn't he?
RIKER: I haven't spoken to him yet.
TUCKER: How about T'Pol? She won't be very co-operative. You wait and
see.
RIKER: I've already started her plomeek broth. All she has to do is
choose a few final ingredients. She'll be down here in about an hour. I
hear we're on our way to pick up Shran.
TUCKER: Can you believe it? We all thought he was dead and gone.
RIKER: Don't you think the Captain's cutting it a little close?
TUCKER: You mean, getting back to San Francisco? Nah, he won't let
anything get in the way of that. Trust me. Can you spare one of those
carrots?
RIKER: They're not peeled yet.
TUCKER: That's okay. (He takes a bite.) TUCKER: You know, he'd never admit it, but
this thing means a hell of a lot to him. He's real proud to be one of
the people signing this charter. And he ought to be.
RIKER: You sound like a lifetime member of the Jonathan Archer fan
club.
TUCKER: I can count on one hand the number of people I trust. I don't
mean trust like I trust you aren't lying to me or, I trust you won't
steal my money. I'm talking about the kind of trust where you know
someone's not going to hurt you, no matter what. Where you know they'll
always be there for you, no matter how bad things get. You ever know
anybody like that?
RIKER: Yeah. One or two.
TUCKER: Well, I got some packing to do before I go back on duty. You
figured out what you're going to do?
RIKER: Do?
TUCKER: You gonna sign on to another ship, or are you gonna open up
that little restaurant in the Berkshires you told me about?
RIKER: You know, I haven't decided yet. You got any advice?
TUCKER: Nope. But I'm sure you'll make the right choice.
[Auditorium]
(The senior staff are seated very high up, in a top
gallery overlooking a huge arena. Civilians are taking their seats
around them. Troi is watching too.)
REED: Are you certain these are the right seats?
TRAVIS: Yep.
REED: They don't seem very VIP to me.
HOSHI: I'm sure the Admiral wanted us to have a view that took in the
scope of the occasion.
REED: From this distance you can't tell an Andorian from a Tellarite.
HOSHI: (to Travis) Have you given an answer to Captain Stillwell yet?
TRAVIS: I've asked him for a little more time, until Captain Archer
decides what he's going to be doing.
REED: I'll bet you a month's pay he'll be on the bridge of a new ship.
He won't be able to resist one of those warp seven beauties.
HOSHI: I've heard he's already been tapped for admiral.
TRAVIS: Malcolm's right. They'll never keep him behind a desk.
REED: It's very wise of you to stick with him. That's exactly what I
plan to do.
[Green Room]
(Archer is pacing up and down going over his
speech. Phlox is sitting in a chair, and T'Pol tries to adjust Archer's
dress uniform collar.)
T'POL: Please stand still. If you hadn't waited until the last minute,
you would have had time to memorise your speech.
ARCHER: You sound like my ninth grade teacher.
PHLOX: There are dignitaries here from eighteen different worlds. It's
a good sign. I wouldn't be surprised if this alliance begins to expand
before we know it. You should be very proud of yourself, Captain.
ARCHER: I'll be proud of myself if I get this speech out in one piece.
PHLOX: That's not what I meant.
ARCHER: I know what you meant, Phlox, and I appreciate it, but this is
not about me.
T'POL: Why do so many humans refuse to take credit where credit is due?
There are times when modesty and humility are quite illogical.
ENSIGN: Whenever you're ready, sir.
PHLOX: Well, I've got three wives waiting. I'd better go and join them.
I'd wish you good luck, Captain, but you've always had an ample supply.
ARCHER: Thank you, Doctor.
(Phlox leaves them alone.)
ARCHER: You'd better get out there. You don't want to miss me screwing
this thing up.
T'POL: I'm going to remain down here, if you don't mind.
ARCHER: You never did like crowds, did you?
(He starts up the steps.)
T'POL: You look very heroic.
(Archer comes back down the steps and gives her a big hug. Then he
heads up to the red carpet and rapturous applause.)
[Auditorium]
(Riker joins Troi at the back.)
TROI: Is he nervous?
RIKER: Wouldn't you be?
TROI: Oh, he'll be fine. I had to memorise this speech in grammar
school. You wish you could tell them all that this alliance will give
birth to the Federation.
RIKER: I think I'm ready to talk to Captain Picard. I should have done
it a long time ago.
TROI: So, I guess we're through here.
RIKER: I guess we are. Computer, end programme.
PICARD: Space, the final frontier. These
are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission
KIRK: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new
civilisations
ARCHER: To boldly go where no man has gone before.
